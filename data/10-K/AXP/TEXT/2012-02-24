BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR), IS A GLOBAL SERVICE

COMPANY THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD.

WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965

AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (THE

BHC ACT), SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE).

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WE ARE PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN BUSINESSES COMPRISING FOUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: U.S. CARD SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL CARD

SERVICES, GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH WE DESCRIBE BELOW. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, PUBLISHING BUSINESS AND OTHER

COMPANY OPERATIONS, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE & OTHER.

2011 HIGHLIGHTS

COMPARED WITH 2010, WE DELIVERED.



TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE OF $30.0 BILLION, UP 9% FROM $27.6 BILLION



NET INCOME OF $4.9 BILLION, UP 22% FROM $4.1 BILLION



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BASED ON NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $4.12, UP 23% FROM $3.35



RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY OF 27.7%, COMPARED WITH 27.5%

OUR RESULTS FOR 2011 CONTINUED TO REFLECT STRONG SPENDING GROWTH AND IMPROVED CREDIT PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS A PLANNED SLOWDOWN IN THE GROWTH OF OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR.

DURING THE YEAR CARDMEMBER SPENDING VOLUMES GREW BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, AND ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES, DESPITE BOTH A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND COMPARISONS TO RELATIVELY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS CONTRIBUTED TO A REDUCTION IN LOAN WRITE-OFFS AND IN OVERALL LOSS RESERVE LEVELS OVER THE COURSE OF 2011 WHEN COMPARED TO 2010. GOING FORWARD, WE EXPECT THE BENEFITS TO OUR RESULTS FROM RESERVE RELEASES TO DIMINISH AS CREDIT

METRICS ARE AT HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS.

DESPITE OUR CONTINUED MOMENTUM, COMPETITION REMAINS EXTREMELY INTENSE ACROSS ALL OF

OUR BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINS UNCERTAIN. THE CURRENT INSTABILITY IN EUROPE IN PARTICULAR AND CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS AND LIQUIDITY OF THE EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEMS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECTING CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING, DISRUPTING THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS AND IMPACTING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. EUROPEAN BILLED BUSINESS ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 12 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011. WE ALSO RECEIVED THE LAST SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS FROM MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (MASTERCARD) AND VISA INC. (VISA) IN 2011

AND FACE MORE DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS IN LIGHT OF STRONG 2010 AND 2011 VOLUME AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE. DUE TO THESE FACTORS, WE ARE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLAN TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF OPERATING EXPENSES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

IN 2012, WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FOCUS ON SEVERAL INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO HELP US ACCOMPLISH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH GOALS.

INCREASING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING ACROSS ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE TRANSFORMING OUR CUSTOMERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE; DELIVERING GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS; ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP; AND BROADENING AND DEEPENING OUR CUSTOMER BASE THROUGH THE ADDITION OF MORE WOMEN, MINORITIES AND YOUNGER ADULTS. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR INVESTMENTS ON BOTH DRIVING NEAR-TERM METRICS AND BUILDING CAPABILITIES

THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM SUCCESS.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 14-106

WE HAVE ALSO RECENTLY FOCUSED ON GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON

THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS, INCLUDING DIRECT MAIL, ONLINE APPLICATIONS, IN-HOUSE AND THIRD-PARTY SALES FORCES AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GENERATE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF REVENUE.

PORTFOLIO

OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND

PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS

AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS). AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS (CARDMEMBERS) TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE OF 97.4 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2011, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS

(SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $822 BILLION.

TO PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION TO GROW WITHIN NEW REVENUE CATEGORIES, WE CREATED AN ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP TO FOCUS ON GENERATING

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES. FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, SEE CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THE

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, WE ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFORM ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES FOR THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING BY INCREASING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPEND BILLINGS ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS AND ENHANCING CUSTOMERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, BOTH ORGANICALLY

AND THROUGH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES GENERALLY TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO

BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL

WE BELIEVE OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES BY

GIVING US THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH

THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD

TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND BUILD ALGORITHMS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL

TOOLS THAT ENABLE US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION ON

CARDMEMBER SPENDING, AND COMPLY WITH OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND FIREWALL AND ANTITRUST POLICIES AND APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS HIGHER

ON AVERAGE ON A PER-CARD BASIS VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, OFFERS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN DISCOUNT RATES THAT ALLOW US TO INVEST MORE IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR

MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. BECAUSE OF THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST IN MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBERS, AS WELL AS TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND

INVESTMENTS FOR MERCHANTS, ALL OF WHICH IN TURN CREATE INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND OTHER COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARDMEMBERS INCENT CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS AND

CARDMEMBER LOYALTY.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES  TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE  ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT THESE

ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES, AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE.

WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING

AND PROMOTING IT. IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES (GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL PAYMENTS NETWORK THAT PROCESSES AND SETTLES

PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY CARD TRANSACTIONS. GNMS ACQUIRES MERCHANTS AND PROVIDES POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS, MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CAPABILITIES, SERVICES AND DATA, LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. IT PROVIDES ATM SERVICES

AND ENTERS INTO PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, LICENSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE GLOBAL NETWORK.

THE MAJORITY OF CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, TRS, BY THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (CENTURION

BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB), AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS

WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NETWORK WORLDWIDE. CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS, AND DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, THEY ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT

ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH ACCESS TO

RICH TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS, PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND

PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING, ANALYTICAL AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS AND,

IN SOME COUNTRIES, ACT AS MERCHANT ACQUIRERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THIS STRATEGY

ALSO ENABLES US TO ENHANCE OUR PRESENCE IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE ALREADY DO BUSINESS AND EXPAND OUR PRESENCE INTO NEW GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS

ESTABLISHED 139 CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 155 COUNTRIES. IN ASSESSING WHETHER WE SHOULD PURSUE A PROPRIETARY OR GNS STRATEGY IN A GIVEN COUNTRY, OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF, WE CONSIDER

A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STABILITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF RETURNS, THE SIZE OF THE AFFLUENT SEGMENT, THE STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE MARKETING AND CREDIT DATA, THE SIZE OF CO-BRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE CAN BEST CREATE

STRONG MERCHANT VALUE.

IN 2011, GNS SIGNED 11 NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, INCLUDING NEW CARD-ISSUING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE BANK OF CHINA, THE KOREA EXCHANGE BANK, THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA AND A CARD-ISSUING SUBSIDIARY OF ISETAN MITSUKOSHI GROUP. GNS ALSO SUPPORTED EXISTING PARTNERS IN

LAUNCHING APPROXIMATELY 69 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2011, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO OVER 1,000. NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN 2011 INCLUDE THE FIRST AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CONTACTLESS CREDIT CARDS IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM FROM MBNA EUROPE BANK LTD.; THE DIAMOND AWARDS AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARD FROM COMMONWEALTH BANK OF

AUSTRALIA; THE MAYBANKARD 2 AMERICAN EXPRESS

CREDIT CARD WITH MAYBANK IN MALAYSIA; THE ICBC PLATINUM AMERICAN

AND THE COSTCO SAMSUNG AMERICAN EXPRESS

ISSUED THROUGH GNS RELATIONSHIPS, LAUNCHING FOUR NEW AIRLINE CO-BRANDS IN 2011 BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 57 AIRLINE CO-BRAND PRODUCTS.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE

OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST

AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY

STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE

STANDARDS.

**

WITH OVER 1,000 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS

STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO ALTER THE TERMS OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORKS GLOBAL PRESENCE GENERALLY

WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES TO WHOM THEY CAN TARGET AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 23%, AND TOTALED OVER 34 MILLION CARDS AT THE END OF 2011. OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, 77% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2011 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 25% SINCE 1999. YEAR-OVER-YEAR SPENDING GROWTH ON THESE CARDS IN 2011 WAS 27%, WITH TOTAL SPENDING EQUAL TO

$117 BILLION.

GNS ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE CARD TRANSACTION VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES

WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD-ISSUING

BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT LOSSES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL

SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT

FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF

2011, WE HAD 67 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE

AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE COUNTRY, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR

STANDARDS, IO BANK PARTNERS ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM CARD

®

. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES,

ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE OF DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES ON CARDS-IN-FORCE. OUR IO PARTNERS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS

RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO

REDUCE THIS RISK.

INDONESIA, TURKEY, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA, SOUTH KOREA, MALAYSIA, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2011, WE HAD 68 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE

OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN SHARE IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTION A

LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING

THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT OF SALE

THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING, ROYALTIES,

CURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE PARTNER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, PLUS OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS FOR THE

ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK

ARISING FROM THE NCL PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR

FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF

FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN NCL ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANK OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE (JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE COUNTRIES,

WE JOIN WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL AND U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CURRENCY CARDS THAT CARRY

OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR

JV PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE

RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS OVERSEAS CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED, PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS JVS FROM TIME

TO TIME.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GMS BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS, ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND SETTLING WITH MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS

WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO PROVIDE MARKETING INFORMATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS, SERVICING AND FRAUD PREVENTION AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. CONTINUED INVESTMENTS

IN THE GMS BUSINESS WERE A KEY PRIORITY IN 2011 AND WILL REMAIN SO IN 2012.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO

USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT ACTIVATION IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE CARD. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES

CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS, THE INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD

CONTACT US DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

DURING 2011, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN EXPRESS ONEPOINT

®

PROGRAM BY ADDING THIRD-PARTY AGENTS TO SERVICE OUR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. UNDER

THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, MANAGE THE MERCHANT PRICING PROCESS, AND RECEIVE THE

SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS, SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER

SERVICE. WE ARE NOW FOLLOWING A SIMILAR STRATEGY IN SPAIN THROUGH AN ARRANGEMENT WITH LA CAIXA AND IN MEXICO THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANCO SANTANDER AND ELAVON INC.

IN JUNE 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THE U.S.-WIDE ROLLOUT OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH FOURSQUARE THAT ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO ACCESS SPECIAL MERCHANT OFFERS THROUGH THE POPULAR LOCATION-BASED MOBILE PLATFORM. MERCHANTS

CAN OFFER TAILORED DEALS THAT MAY BE REDEEMED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE POINT OF SALE WHEN THE REGISTERED CARD IS USED FOR THE PURCHASE  WITHOUT COUPONS, OFFER CODES OR SALES STAFF TRAINING. MERCHANT OFFERS INITIALLY INCLUDED RETAILERS H&M AND

SPORTS AUTHORITY AND SOME RESTAURANTS OWNED BY THE UNION SQUARE HOSPITALITY GROUP (SUCH AS UNION SQUARE CAFE, BLUE SMOKE AND THE MODERN). SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE PARTNERSHIP, ADDITIONAL MERCHANTS SUCH AS DIANE VON FURSTENBERG AND DUNKIN DONUTS

HAVE OFFERED DEALS VIA THE AMERICAN EXPRESS-FOURSQUARE PARTNERSHIP.

IN JULY 2011, WE ALSO USED OUR

COUPONLESS FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES TO LAUNCH THE LINK, LIKE, LOVE

SM

 APPLICATION ON FACEBOOK, PROVIDING CARDMEMBERS WITH DEALS, ACCESS AND EXPERIENCES BASED ON THE LIKES, INTERESTS AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS OF CARDMEMBERS AND THEIR FACEBOOK FRIENDS. CARDMEMBERS CAN

RECEIVE STATEMENT CREDITS AS THEY SHOP ONLINE OR IN STORES, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR COUPONS OR SPECIAL CODES.

IN 2011, WE

COMPLETED THE INTEGRATION OF ACCERTIFY INC., A LEADING PROVIDER OF SOLUTIONS THAT HELP MERCHANTS COMBAT FRAUDULENT ONLINE AND OTHER CARD-NOT-PRESENT TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER OF 2010. LAUNCHED IN 2007, ACCERTIFY PROVIDES A HOSTED

SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT OFFERS AN EXTRA LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR TRANSACTIONS OVER ANY OF THE MAJOR PAYMENT NETWORKS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER AND PAYPAL, OR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHOD. ACCERTIFY ALSO OFFERS

MERCHANTS THE OPTION TO OUTSOURCE THEIR END-TO-END FRAUD MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ACCERTIFY, AMERICAN EXPRESS IS ABLE TO BROADEN ITS FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS THAT TAKE

PLACE ON ALL NETWORKS. ACCERTIFYS CAPABILITIES ARE INCREMENTAL AND COMPLEMENTARY TO AMERICAN EXPRESS FRAUD SOLUTIONS ALREADY OFFERED TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

GMS CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT

ACCEPT THE CARD IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CARDMEMBER NEEDS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2011, ONLY 28% OF U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED, IN PART, FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED

DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS, AND INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR SPENDING.

DURING 2011, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD ACCEPTANCE IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY, INSURANCE AND ADVERTISING. WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING

CATEGORIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE.

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2011, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE ESTIMATE THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2011,

OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. OUR INTERNATIONAL SPEND COVERAGE IS MORE LIMITED, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN

LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON COMPARING OUR

CARDMEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED

FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN MOST CASES, INCLUDING FOR ALL U.S. MERCHANTS, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS

FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN

A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US FROM THE MERCHANT.

WHERE WE ACT

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN

OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK

WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD ISSUER GENERATES A

RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY

NEGOTIATED ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS THOSE OPERATED BY VISA AND MASTERCARD, THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE

TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE 3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE NCL

MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE REFLECTS THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND THE INVESTMENTS WE

MAKE IN PROVIDING THAT VALUE. WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR PRODUCT AND NETWORK FEATURES AND

FUNCTIONALITY, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE AND PROGRAMS, INFORMATION SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WHICH ENHANCE THE MERCHANT VALUE PROPOSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES WITH, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE MERCHANTS CHARGE

VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT.

IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WAS 2.54

PERCENT AND 2.55 PERCENT FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. OVER TIME, CERTAIN REPRICING INITIATIVES, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOME EROSION OF THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT

RATE.

WHILE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO

ENCOUNTER MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. OUR CARDMEMBERS VALUE THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR CARDS WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO,

AND WE, THEREFORE, TAKE STEPS TO SEEK TO SERVE OUR CARDMEMBERS DESIRES AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

(DODD-FRANK) IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MAKE EFFORTS TO LIMIT

CARD SUPPRESSION BY FOCUSING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS

SELECTS

®

, WHICH ENABLE MERCHANTS OF ANY SIZE TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY PROVIDING

EXCLUSIVE OFFERS AND EXPERIENCES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS; DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING NEW AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESS INSIGHTS, MARKETING PROGRAMS (SUCH AS THE FOURSQUARE PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE AND OUR SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY

®

EVENT DESCRIBED BELOW) AND FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK;

PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXERCISING OUR RIGHT TO TERMINATE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS WHO SEEK TO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A CLIENT MANAGEMENT

ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO GROWING OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS BUSINESS AND FINDING WAYS TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE MERCHANTS CHOICE

WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND THAT ALL MERCHANTS HAVE NUMEROUS OPTIONS GIVEN THE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. THEREFORE, WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING SUPERIOR AND

DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS.

THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES PROHIBIT THE SURCHARGING OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH SURCHARGING IS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN

THE EUROPEAN UNION. AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING SO LONG AS IT IS PERMITTED BY LAW AND A MERCHANT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CARD BY SURCHARGING HIGHER AMOUNTS ON

PURCHASES WITH THE CARD THAN ON PURCHASES WITH OTHER CARDS, OR BY IMPOSING A SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH OTHER CARDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO DOES NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY

WITH CASH, CHECK OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS (I.E., AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE OR ACH). IN ADDITION, AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT PROHIBIT U.S. MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR IN-KIND INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH PARTICULAR

FORMS OF PAYMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK. FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PROCEEDING AGAINST US BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING VIOLATION OF THE

U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR BRAND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE, SEE CORPORATE MATTERS WITHIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

GMS IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION,

INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING TOOLS SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA AND APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE. WE ALSO OFFER

OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED

ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS). VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS THAT MAKE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD MORE SECURE AND CONVENIENT FOR MERCHANTS

AND CARDMEMBERS. WE PARTICIPATE IN STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, SUCH AS EMVCO, GLOBALPLATFORM AND PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC (PCI SSC), TO HELP DRIVE SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY, MAKING IT EASIER FOR MERCHANTS TO

ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARDMEMBERS TO HAVE A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE AT THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS THAT HAVE MORE THAN ONE NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE A STANDARD ACROSS THEIR CARD PRODUCTS. THESE EFFORTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES MOVE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY INCREASINGLY AWAY FROM MAG-STRIPE TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER A CONTACTLESS PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, TO PROVIDE A FAST,

EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE TO CASH, CHECK, DEBIT OR OTHER PAYMENT FORMS, PARTICULARLY FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS WHERE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS, DRUG AND

CONVENIENCE STORES AND MAJOR RETAIL CHAINS ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE

INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. WE HAVE CREATED A BUSINESS WITHIN GMS CALLED

AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

BUSINESS INSIGHTS, WHICH OFFERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DERIVED FROM OUR STRONG BUSINESS MODEL

AND CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. BUSINESS INSIGHTS COMBINES AGGREGATED, NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA AND TREND ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED BUSINESS PLANNING AND MARKETING EXPERTISE TO OUR MERCHANT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT

THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING, AND COMPLY WITH OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND FIREWALL AND ANTITRUST POLICIES AND APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. IN 2011, WE EXPANDED BUSINESS INSIGHTS TO BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

AND FRANCE. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW PRODUCT CALLED INSIGHTS ONLINE THAT DELIVERS STREAMLINED BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IN A DYNAMIC, WEB-BASED FORMAT AND IS TARGETED AT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES.

WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED LOOP, WHICH PERMITS

THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS, AS WELL AS HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES, AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE

CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF

THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED THROUGH CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR

PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT, REQUIRING THE MERCHANT TO SECURE A LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA, THIRD-PARTY

PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE, KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION, REDUCES

OR ELIMINATES REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS STILL NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER ITS USE WILL EXPAND OVER TIME.

OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  COMPETITION

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETES IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, VISA,

MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH IS OWNED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), DISCOVER (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES) AND JCB AND CHINA UNIONPAY (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK

ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD. IN ADDITION TO SUCH NETWORKS, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS AND COMPANIES SUCH AS PAYPAL, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE

PERFORMED BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO SINGLE ENTITY ENGAGES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS MODEL.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES

(INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND

TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE

HAVE THE LARGEST VOLUME OF ONLINE SPENDING OF ANY MAJOR CARD ISSUER AND MORE GLOBAL ONLINE BILLINGS VOLUME THAN PAYPAL, THE COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE FOR CAPTURING ONLINE SPEND IN THE EVER-INCREASING DIGITAL WORLD, AND ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS

PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE, UNLIKE US, PAYPAL HAS THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE MERCHANTS FOR MULTIPLE PAYMENT NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, NEW ENTRANTS TO THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE SUCH AS ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE AN

ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE AND POTENTIALLY DISINTERMEDIATING FACTOR IN THE CARD PAYMENT INDUSTRY GIVEN THE SCALE OF THEIR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP NEW PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND, DISCOUNT REVENUES AND

POTENTIALLY OTHER REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED

ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, MERCHANTS WITH RECURRING BILLING MODELS ACTIVELY SEEK TO SWITCH CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT THROUGH DIRECT DEBITS FROM BANK ACCOUNTS, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE

MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP  ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS  COMPETITION UNDER CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED-LOOP FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS VISA, WITH ITS VISA INCENTIVE NETWORK, AND MASTERCARD, WITH ITS MASTERCARD ADVISORS. EFFORTS BY VISA, MASTERCARD AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT PROVIDERS TO

REPLICATE THE CLOSED LOOP SUPPORT ITS CONTINUED VALUE AND THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE

GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC).

AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS

REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT). WE CONDUCT DUE

DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS A RESULT OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BEING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGULATORY STATUS, SEE SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION  GENERAL BELOW.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE

FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS ON CERTAIN CARD NETWORKS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND,

POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN

FOUR-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY

AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR

ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, DODD-FRANK GAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES

REGARDING INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE COST

OF A TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS (BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED

OR LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES) ARE EXEMPT FROM THE INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS, ALTHOUGH ALL PREPAID CARDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED ITS

FINAL RULE ON JUNE 29, 2011, WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE REGULATIONS ON INTERCHANGE AND ROUTING DO NOT APPLY TO A THREE-PARTY NETWORK LIKE AMERICAN EXPRESS WHEN IT ACTS AS BOTH THE ISSUER AND THE NETWORK FOR ITS PREPAID CARDS, AND IS THEREFORE NOT

A PAYMENT CARD NETWORK AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED AND USED FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THIS FINAL RULE.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE

CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW,

THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES,

PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THESE NEW LAWS, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH

AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE

PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING A MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT

INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL

SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010, VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY FORM OF PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE

DISCOUNTS OR OTHER BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH, CHECK, DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT

OTHERS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE PRIVACY OR DATA SECURITY-RELATED LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE

MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003 RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD

ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULED THAT MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES (MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS DECISION APPLIES TO

CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CREDIT, CHARGE AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TO DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH MASTERCARD HAS CHOSEN TO APPLY THE CROSS-BORDER MIF. THE RULING DOES NOT PREVENT MASTERCARD AND ITS ISSUER BANKS FROM

ADOPTING AN ALTERNATIVE MIF ARRANGEMENT THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO COMPLY WITH EU COMPETITION RULES. ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION INCLUDED COMMERCIAL CARDS, IT HAS RESERVED JUDGMENT FOR THE TIME BEING ON THE LEGALITY OF

MASTERCARDS CROSS-BORDER MIF FOR COMMERCIAL CARD TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD LODGED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS FINDINGS, WHICH IS PENDING. AN INTERIM SETTLEMENT, PENDING THE APPEAL, WAS AGREED TO IN 2009 BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION AND MASTERCARD, CAPPING MIF AT 30 BASIS POINTS FOR CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS AND 20 BASIS POINTS FOR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. IN 2008, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN

RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN EUROPE, AND IN 2010, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ACCEPTED VISA EUROPES PLEDGE TO CUT ITS CROSS-BORDER DEBIT CARD MIF TO 20 BASIS POINTS FOR FOUR YEARS. THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION INTO VISA EUROPES CREDIT AND DEFERRED DEBIT CARD MIF FOR CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS REMAINS ONGOING. DEVELOPMENTS AT THE EU LEVEL MAY AFFECT HOW THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EU

VIEW DOMESTIC INTERCHANGE AND THE PROGRESS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM INDICATED THAT IT WAS DELAYING FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF ITS CASES AGAINST MASTERCARD AND VISA PENDING THE OUTCOME OF

THE APPEAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS DECISION AGAINST MASTERCARD.

WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN

HUNGARY, ITALY AND FRANCE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENACT CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES OR POINT OF SALE SERVICE CHARGES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP FOR THESE MEASURES. ALTHOUGH SUCH LEGISLATION HAS BEEN OR MAY BE EITHER REPEALED OR STRUCK DOWN ON PROCEDURAL

GROUNDS, IT IS POSSIBLE THERE MAY BE FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO ENACT REGULATION OF MERCHANT FEES OR INTERCHANGE WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACTS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS.

IN JANUARY 2012, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT TO STIMULATE DEBATE AND BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION) ENTITLED TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED EUROPEAN MARKET FOR CARD,

INTERNET AND MOBILE PAYMENTS. THE AREA OF FOCUS COVERS A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING: MULTILATERAL

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERCHANGE FEES; SCHEME RULES; SEPARATING SCHEME MANAGEMENT FROM PROCESSING; CROSS-BORDER ACQUIRING; SURCHARGING; CO-BADGING CARDS ACROSS DIFFERENT SCHEMES; MOBILE PAYMENTS; TECHNICAL

STANDARDIZATION; AND GOVERNANCE OF INDUSTRY-LED CHANGES AIMED AT SUPPORTING THE INTEGRATION OF EUROPE IN THE AREA OF PAYMENTS. REGULATORY ACTION IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF THIS CONSULTATION. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SET A THREE-MONTH CONSULTATION

PERIOD, ENDING EARLY APRIL 2012. FURTHER ROUNDS OF CONSULTATION ON ANY EMERGING PROPOSALS WOULD THEN BE EXPECTED BEFORE ANY ACTION IS PURSUED.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED NETWORK RULES THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR CARDS IN CERTAIN

INDUSTRIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS. THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA CONDUCTED A REVIEW DURING 2011 AND HAS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE SURCHARGING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD

ALLOW A SCHEMES RULES TO LIMIT SURCHARGES TO A REASONABLE COST OF ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS OF THAT SCHEME. THE FORM OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATIONS IS SUBJECT TO A FURTHER ROUND OF CONSULTATION IN EARLY 2012.

IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED A RELATIVELY NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR

ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, CALLED THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC ON PAYMENT SERVICES. THIS DIRECTIVE, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE (PSD), PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PSD IS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF A SINGLE INTERNAL PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU

THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE PSD PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR

LIMITING SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER THEY PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SURCHARGING, WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM (WHICH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HAS PERMITTED IT FOR CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES), THE NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN PERMITTING IT, IN SOME CASES WITHIN LIMITS, AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE, ITALY AND SWEDEN PROHIBITING IT. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT DISCOUNTS FOR FORMS OF PAYMENT THAT ARE CHEAPER FOR MERCHANTS TO PROCESS.

THE PSD COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA (SEPA), WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, SEPA INVOLVES THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL

STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. ALL OF THE FOREGOING REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN UNIONS CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE EU COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN OCTOBER 2011,

WILL PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES MORE THAN THE MERCHANTS COST OF ACCEPTANCE. THE MEMBER STATES HAVE TWO YEARS TO ADOPT THIS LEGISLATION.

THE CANADIAN COMPETITION BUREAU HAS COMMENCED AN APPLICATION AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE PRICE MAINTENANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION ACT SEEKING A REMEDIAL ORDER PROHIBITING VISA

AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO, ENFORCING OR IMPOSING TERMS THAT RESTRAIN MERCHANTS FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING USE OF LOWER COST METHODS OF PAYMENT AND DISCOURAGING USE OF CREDIT CARDS WITH HIGHER CARD ACCEPTANCE FEES,

DECLINING ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN CREDIT CARDS AND SURCHARGING CUSTOMERS WHO USE VISA AND MASTERCARD CREDIT CARDS. WHILE THE COMPETITION BUREAU DID NOT NAME AMERICAN EXPRESS IN ITS APPLICATION, THIS ACTION EVIDENCES THE STRONG REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL

FOCUS ON THIS AREA, WHICH COULD HAVE INDIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO PRESET SPENDING

LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY, CREDIT

RECORD AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND,

IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELLED. THE NO-PRESET SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER SEVERAL WAYS FOR ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS

TO PAY OFF CERTAIN OF THEIR PURCHASES OVER TIME. THE SIGN & TRAVEL

®

FEATURE PERMITS ELIGIBLE

U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR AIRLINE TICKETS, CRUISE SHIP TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL ITEMS PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR ELIGIBLE CHARGES ABOVE

A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT.

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT TERMS, INTEREST RATE AND

FEE STRUCTURES, REWARDS PROGRAMS, AND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. REVOLVING CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

, THE BLUE CASH EVERYDAY

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

, PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO PAY THEIR BILL IN FULL EACH MONTH OR CARRY A MONTHLY BALANCE ON THEIR CARDS TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES.

ALONG WITH CHARGE CARDS AND CO-BRAND CARDS, THESE REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ATTRACT AFFLUENT CARDMEMBERS AND PROMOTE INCREASED RELEVANCE FOR OUR EXPANDING MERCHANT NETWORK.

IN 2011, WE LAUNCHED TWO NEW PRODUCTS IN THE BLUE CASH CARD FAMILY: BLUE CASH EVERYDAY

®

AND BLUE CASH PREFERRED

®

. BOTH CARDS OFFER CASH-BACK FEATURES AND BLUE CASH PREFERRED

®

HAS AN ANNUAL FEE, WHICH SUPPORTS THE DIVERSIFICATION OF REVENUE STREAMS IN THIS PORTFOLIO. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW REWARDS PROGRAM FOR THE BLUE CASH CARD FAMILY THAT

ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN REWARDS THAT CAN BE REDEEMED ANYTIME FOR CASH BACK IN THE FORM OF A STATEMENT CREDIT, GIFT CARDS AND MERCHANDISE.

CO-BRAND CARDS

WE

ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN GENERATE

HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS,

SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER

CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE

FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE CO-BRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH

CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES POINTS, OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

DURING 2011, WE LAUNCHED TWO NEW CO-BRANDED CARD PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR MERCEDES-BENZ DRIVERS AND ENTHUSIASTS: THE

MERCEDES-BENZ CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE PLATINUM CARD

®

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS EXCLUSIVELY FOR

MERCEDES-BENZ. IN 2011, WE ALSO INTRODUCED SEVERAL NEW FEATURES ON OUR EXISTING CO-BRANDED CARD PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE INTRODUCED THE DELTA PRIORITY BOARDING BENEFIT, WHICH ALLOWS GOLD, PLATINUM OR RESERVE DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD CARDMEMBERS

TO PRIORITY BOARD ON DELTA FLIGHTS, AS WELL AS SAVINGS ON ELIGIBLE IN-FLIGHT PURCHASES ON DELTA AIR LINES-OPERATED FLIGHTS.

CARD PRICING

AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

ON CERTAIN CARDS WE CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF

CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE MAY ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAMS AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G., AUTOMATIC FLIGHT INSURANCE). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS, INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, DINING AND

ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. POINTS GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS

EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150 REDEMPTION PARTNERS AND

FEATURES OVER 500 MERCHANDISE BRANDS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THE CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD THEY HAVE IN THEIR WALLET. FOR THOSE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ZYNC FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, WE HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPRESS

PROGRAM. AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS GREEN AND GOLD CARDS HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM. PLATINUM CARD

MEMBERS AND CENTURION

CARDMEMBERS ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS FIRST

WE BELIEVE OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

POINT BANK IS A SUBSTANTIAL ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS AS A VIRTUAL CURRENCY. CARDMEMBERS INCREASINGLY USE OUR PAY WITH POINTS PROGRAM INCLUDING TO MAKE PURCHASES ON AMAZON.COM AND FOR AIRLINE TICKETS

AND OTHER TRAVEL CATEGORIES, AS WELL AS TO PAY FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE.

DURING 2011, WE ADDED A NUMBER OF NEW

REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS SEVERAL POPULAR CATEGORIES SUCH AS DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT (OPENTABLE), RETAIL (RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT, INC.) AND TRAVEL (FOUR SEASONS HOTELS & RESORTS). CARDMEMBERS CAN ALSO NOW USE THEIR POINTS TO PURCHASE

ADVERTISING CREDITS FOR FACEBOOK, GIFT CARDS FOR SEAMLESS.COM AND GIFT CERTIFICATES AT VENTE-PRIVEE USA, A MEMBERS-ONLY PREMIUM SHOPPING SITE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION PARTNERS. AT YEAR-END, WE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENT CARDMEMBERS WILL ULTIMATELY REDEEM

APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THEIR POINTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  RESERVES FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS APPEARING ON PAGE 16 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER

SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE HAVE

GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS

AND TO MERCHANTS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARDMEMBERS.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS  COMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD ISSUER,

WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS, AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH ISSUES THE

DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING

ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS.

IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROVIDING

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER

PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH

PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT

CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A

RESULT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS WERE HISTORICALLY MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND

TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN FOR SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THERE IS NO CREDIT EXTENDED WHEN A DEBIT CARD IS USED AND THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THE PURCHASE AT THE

TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AS OPPOSED TO CHARGE CARDS WHERE PAYMENT IS DUE AT THE END OF THE BILLING PERIOD OR CREDIT CARDS WHERE PAYMENT CAN BE EXTENDED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. HOWEVER, DEBIT CARDS ARE ALSO PERCEIVED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CREDIT OR

CHARGE CARDS AND USED IN THAT MANNER. ADDITIONALLY, OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS CAN BE USED BY OUR COMPETITORS TO EXTEND CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS WHEN TRANSACTION VALUES EXCEED MONIES AVAILABLE IN A LINKED DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT.

AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE

EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING OF ONE OR

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY MEETS ITS FINANCING NEEDS THROUGH A

VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH A SECURED FINANCING FACILITY,

AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. MARKETS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (CREDCO), ACQUIRES OR FINANCES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CARDS

ISSUED IN CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FUNDS THE ACQUISITION OR FINANCING OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND

CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY ACCEPTING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS.

THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS.

THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF OUR

SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 29-33 UNDER THE CAPTION FINANCIAL REVIEW, AND NOTE 7 ON PAGE 74 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS WE INCORPORATE HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IN ADDITION,

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND AEBFSB ACCEPTS DEPOSITS

DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$37.3 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS. AS PART OF OUR

FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2011 WERE ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, A SUITE OF DEPOSIT PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AEBFSB. OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH THOSE OF

OTHER DEPOSIT-TAKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS AND/OR BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT SECTOR ON THE BASIS OF RATES AND OUR BRAND

REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND SERVICE.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON

ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A

WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE

FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION

BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN

THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER,

ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, OR REQUIRE

AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS  REGULATION

OUR

CHARGE CARD, CONSUMER LENDING AND DEPOSIT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.



THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT)



THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA), AS AMENDED BY THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (FACT ACT) (WHICH, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED)



THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (TILA) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED),

INCLUDING THE AMENDMENTS TO TILA THAT WERE ADOPTED THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS)



THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES THE MANNER IN WHICH BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES CERTAIN BILLING

REQUIREMENTS)



THE TRUTH IN SAVINGS ACT (WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ABOUT RATES PAID AND OTHER TERMS OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS)

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT ENGAGING IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES IN OFFERING CONSUMER

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE

COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE

SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE AND DATA PROTECTION-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES). BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS

OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS STATED ABOVE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL BELOW.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, AND OUR

OTHER BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST, AND FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008, SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY RELEVANT LAWS, REGULATIONS

AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND REGULATORS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE CONTINUED TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON CERTAIN PRACTICES OF CREDIT CARD ISSUERS, SUCH AS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS

PRACTICES, INCREASES IN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES (APRS), CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT, AND THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES AND FINANCIAL CHARGES CHARGED BY CARD ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS

BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. IN AUGUST 2010, AEBFSB ENTERED INTO A PUBLIC, WRITTEN SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (OTS), WHICH WAS THEN ITS PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, REQUIRING

AEBFSB TO MAKE CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO COMPLIANCE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS

IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECENTLY ENACTED CARD ACT, SEE PRIVACY, FAIR CREDIT

REPORTING WITHIN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL BELOW. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CENTURION BANKS RECEIPT OF A NOTICE FROM THE FDIC REGARDING ITS PLAN TO TAKE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST CENTURION BANK IN

CONNECTION WITH A REVIEW BY THE FDIC AND THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (DFI) OF CENTURION BANKS CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS.

(1) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (2) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES; (3) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES; (4) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND (5) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRACTICES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT,

MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES

WE ISSUE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD AND WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON

THOSE COUNTRIES THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER US THE GREATEST FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CARDS ISSUED INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, SEE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ABOVE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR

ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2011. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER ON OUR OWN OR AS CO-BRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. AS WE HAVE RENEWED MANY OF OUR CO-BRAND AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEALS, WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ADDING NEW PRODUCTS,

NEW CHANNELS, AND INCREASINGLY, NEW COUNTRIES TO THE AGREEMENTS. IN 2011, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW CO-BRANDED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A SUITE OF CO-BRAND CARDS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VIRGIN AUSTRALIA, A NEW

COSTCO CREDIT CARD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND A NEW DELTA AIR LINES CO-BRAND CREDIT CARD IN JAPAN. WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AS WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY ISSUING

BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN &

TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER

ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH MORE THAN 30 OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A

SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

PROGRAM IS A

STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,300 REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 75 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THESE

PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 35 AIRLINES AND OVER 175 HOTELS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT CERTIFICATES,

EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CHARITY REWARDS. IN 2011, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS MORE QUICKLY.

WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR STRENGTHS AND LOOK FOR FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE INTERNATIONALLY. DURING 2011, WE

COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN LOYALTY PARTNER, A LEADING MARKETING SERVICES COMPANY KNOWN FOR THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS IT OPERATES IN GERMANY, POLAND AND INDIA. THIS ACQUISITION HAS FURTHERED OUR STRATEGY TO GROW FEE-BASED

REVENUE, DEEPENED OUR MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS IN SELECT COUNTRIES, ADDED MORE THAN 36 MILLION CONSUMERS TO OUR INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER BASE AND EXPANDED OUR RANGE OF REWARDS AND LOYALTY MARKETING SERVICES. LOYALTY PARTNER BUILDS MERCHANT

COALITIONS, SUCH AS ITS PAYBACK PROGRAM, AND OFFERS LOYALTY CARDS GOOD FOR DISCOUNTS AND REWARDS AT PARTICIPATING COALITION PARTNERS. MERCHANTS FUND THE CONSUMER OFFERS AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCUMULATED LOYALTY POINTS, AND LOYALTY PARTNER

EARNS REVENUE FROM OPERATING THE LOYALTY PLATFORM AND BY PROVIDING MARKETING SUPPORT. IN 2011, WE LAUNCHED, THROUGH LOYALTY PARTNER, THE PAYBACK PROGRAM IN INDIA. THE FUTURE GROUP, ONE OF INDIAS LARGEST RETAILERS, BECAME THE FIRST PAYBACK

PARTNER IN INDIA AND ADDED 1,600 NEW POINTS-OF-SALE TO THE PAYBACK NETWORK, DOUBLING ITS SIZE. LOYALTY PARTNER ALSO PROVIDES MARKET ANALYSIS, OPERATING PLATFORMS AND CONSULTING SERVICES THAT HELP MERCHANTS GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. USING THESE

WE EXPANDED

THE FLEXIBILITY OF PAYMENT FOR TRAVEL AND CONCIERGE SERVICES BY ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS TO USE THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO PAY FOR THEIR TRAVEL PURCHASES IN 15 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD  COMPETITION

COMPARED WITH THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES USE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS FOR A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES

JUST BEGINNING TO TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD, WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHARE IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE INTERNATIONALLY. OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS IS

SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE VIEW CITIBANK AND BANCO SANTANDER AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, AS THEY

CURRENTLY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD  REGULATION

AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, REGULATORS IN 2011 CONTINUED TO PROPOSE AND ENACT A VARIETY OF REGULATORY CHANGES TO THE PAYMENTS

LANDSCAPE IN MANY OF OUR KEY COUNTRIES. REGULATORS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN ALMOST ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THEIR SCOPE HAS BEEN VERY BROAD. PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, AML AND CONSUMER CREDIT HAVE BEEN KEY THEMES IN BOTH REGULATIONS AND

EXAMINATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA WE HAVE SEEN BOTH LOCAL AND REGIONAL INITIATIVES AS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION LOOKS TO INTRODUCE MORE HARMONIZATION MEASURES, SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 2008/48/EC ON CREDIT AGREEMENTS FOR

CONSUMERS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE CONSUMER CREDIT DIRECTIVE), WHICH HARMONIZES THE PROVISION OF CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS. OUTSIDE EUROPE, REGULATIONS IN MEXICO, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG AND INDIA HAVE BEEN A FOCUS. SOME JURISDICTIONS, SUCH AS

MEXICO, HONG KONG AND INDIA, ARE ENACTING LEGISLATION MANDATING THE MIGRATION TO THE EMV STANDARD FOR CARD ISSUING AND ACCEPTANCE, FOLLOWING THE APPROACH TAKEN IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA. THE EMV STANDARD IS A GLOBAL STANDARD FOR CREDIT AND DEBIT

PAYMENT CARDS BASED ON CHIP CARD TECHNOLOGY AND IS MANAGED AND MAINTAINED BY EMVCO, A STANDARDS BODY IN WHICH WE ARE AN OWNER-MEMBER.

WE EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE IN 2012. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EVOLVING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.

HELPS BUSINESSES CONTROL MEETING-RELATED EXPENSES. IT ALLOWS CLIENTS TO CAPTURE MEETING SPENDING, SIMPLIFY THE PAYMENT PROCESS AND GAIN ACCESS TO DATA TO SUPPORT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUPPLIERS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY OTHER COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO OFFER A NUMBER OF CO-BRAND CORPORATE CARDS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. TO DATE, AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS 14 CORPORATE CARD CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIPS WORLDWIDE. THESE PRODUCTS, TYPICALLY SUITED FOR MID-SIZED COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION

WORLDWIDE), PROVIDE SAVINGS ON EVERYDAY BUSINESS SPENDING AND/OR AIR TRAVEL. GCP IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MID-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE A

CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED, MID-SIZED COMPANIES TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS SPENDING ON THE CORPORATE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

THE CORPORATE PAYMENTS SECTOR IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE NETWORK AND PAYMENT PROVIDER LEVELS. AT THE NETWORK LEVEL, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING

COMPETITION INCLUDING INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION, AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION INTO NEW AND EMERGING SEGMENTS, EFFORTS TO TRANSITION B2B SPEND FROM CASH AND CHECK TO CARDS AND ELECTRONIC INVOICING AND PAYMENT VEHICLES, AND EXPANDING MARKETING AND ADVERTISING

BUDGETS FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES. BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CARD

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE AND CITIBANK TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. MOREOVER, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, THE INTEREST IN EXPENSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, AS CLIENTS AIM TO CAPTURE DATA, ANALYZE TRENDS AND MAKE DECISIONS THAT ENHANCE THEIR CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY.

AT THE PAYMENT PROVIDER LEVEL, WE ARE SEEING INCREASED COMPETITION, PARTICULARLY FOR MID-SIZED COMPANIES, FROM BOTH REGIONAL BANKS AND

NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK AND JPMORGAN. PAYMENT PROVIDERS HAVE INCREASINGLY ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS TO ENHANCE DATA CAPTURE CAPABILITIES AND REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY. IN ADDITION, MANY PROVIDERS ATTEMPT TO LEVERAGE THEIR BANKING

RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPABILITIES TO SECURE AND RETAIN CARD BUSINESS. GLOBAL SERVICING, DATA QUALITY, TECHNOLOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY AND SIMPLICITY, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND PRICE AND OTHER FINANCIAL TERMS ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE

CORPORATE PAYMENTS BUSINESS.

GLOBAL CORPORATE PAYMENTS  REGULATION

THE GLOBAL CORPORATE PAYMENTS BUSINESS, WHICH ENGAGES IN THE EXTENSION OF COMMERCIAL CREDIT, IS SUBJECT TO MORE LIMITED REGULATION THAN

OUR CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS APPLICABLE TO OUR CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT, THE FCRA (AS AMENDED BY THE FACT ACT), AS WELL AS

LAWS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN STATE LAWS THAT REGULATE FEES AND CHARGES ON OUR PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. STATE DATA

SECURITY AND BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DATA PROTECTION LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALONG WITH THE REST OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL BELOW. IN SOME COUNTRIES, REGULATION OF CARD PRACTICES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION MAY APPLY TO SOME CORPORATE PAYMENTS

RELATIONSHIPS.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL

AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL PROVIDES GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, AS WELL AS THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS, TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE THEIR TRAVEL

INVESTMENTS AND SERVICE THEIR TRAVELING EMPLOYEES. WITH CLIENTS RANGING FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO MULTINATIONAL AND GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE: TRAVEL RESERVATION ADVICE AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK THAT IS

AVAILABLE 24 HOURS PER DAY; TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT POLICY CONSULTATION; MEETING MANAGEMENT, SUPPLIER NEGOTIATION AND CONSULTATION; ADVISORY SERVICES, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION REPORTING, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, DATA ANALYSIS, RESEARCH AND

BENCHMARKING; GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL SERVICES; POLICY CONTROL ADVICE; AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS TO HELP TRAVELERS BE MORE EFFICIENT WHEN TRAVELING ON BUSINESS.

WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR ECONOMIC MODEL AND INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE THE VALUE THAT WE DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND

OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OUR RELIANCE ON COMMISSION REVENUES FROM SUPPLIERS (SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS) AND NOW GENERATE REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM CUSTOMERS WHO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE.

WE LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS IN 2011. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE SOLUTIONS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE OUR CLIENTS WITH SAVINGS, CONTROL, SERVICES AND TRAVELER CARE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ENHANCED OUR HOTEL OFFERING BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RATES AND INCLUDING ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT DO NOT LOAD CONTENT IN VARIOUS TRAVEL BOOKING ENGINES. WE

MADE ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR MOBILE TRAVEL SOLUTION, MOBILEXTEND

®

, WHICH PROVIDES TRAVELERS WITH VARIOUS MOBILE

SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING A NEW FEATURE THAT ENABLES TRAVEL MANAGERS TO MANAGE AND LOCATE TRAVELERS AROUND THE GLOBE IN CASE OF TRAVEL EMERGENCIES OR DISRUPTION. WE ALSO LAUNCHED OPEN BUSINESS TRAVEL, AN ONLINE TRAVEL BOOKING TOOL DESIGNED

SPECIFICALLY FOR OPEN SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL  COMPETITION

AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS

TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS AND NEW ENTRANTS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE,

GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER. COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS. NEW ENTRANTS COULD ALSO REPRESENT ADDITIONAL COMPETITION

ALONG THE END-TO-END TRAVEL VALUE CHAIN, WHICH COULD IMPACT COMPETITION IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.

FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AGENT COMPENSATION. CARRIERS HAVE

ALSO MADE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE

FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS INCLUDING EXPANDED GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES. THIS IMMUNITY ENABLES

AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THESE TYPES OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, SEE RISK FACTORS BELOW.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG

TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS, AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY

FOR TRAVEL AGENTS.

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR BUSINESS MODEL TO PERMIT US TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR THE

SERVICES WE PROVIDE AND THE VALUE WE CREATE, AND RESTRUCTURED OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH THE RATIONALIZATION OF OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS AND THE TRANSITIONING OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE

DELIVER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL

INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE TRAVEL BUSINESS IS BROAD WITH MUCH OVERLAP BETWEEN CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS TRAVEL. SEE AMERICAN EXPRESS U.S. CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK  COMPETITION UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES ABOVE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL  REGULATION

THE GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO THE PROVISION OF TRAVEL SERVICES, INCLUDING LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS LAWS AND REGULATIONS

REGARDING PASSENGER SCREENING AND REGISTRATION SUCH AS THE SECURE FLIGHT RULE ISSUED BY THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY, DATA

SECURITY AND BREACH NOTIFICATION, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DATA PROTECTION LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT

AMOUNTS OWED TO US.

CORPORATE & OTHER

CORPORATE & OTHER CONSISTS OF CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP, THE COMPANYS PUBLISHING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS. WE ALSO DISCUSS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE IN THIS SECTION.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DISCUSSED IN CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGE 32 OF OUR

2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, OUR CORPORATE LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO CASH, READILY-MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONTINGENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, SUCH THAT WE CAN CONTINUOUSLY MEET EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS AND

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. A LARGE PORTION OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE IN CORPORATE & OTHER INCLUDES THE INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO MAINTAINING THIS EXCESS LIQUIDITY POOL SINCE ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM

THE LIQUIDITY.

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP

THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP WAS ESTABLISHED TO PURSUE NEW FORMS OF PAYMENTS AND DIGITAL COMMERCE THAT OPEN AMERICAN EXPRESS TO NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS, NEW GEOGRAPHIES ACROSS THE WORLD, AND NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS INCLUDES GROWING A DIGITAL SERVICES PLATFORM FOR THE COMPANY, EXPANDING ALTERNATIVE MOBILE AND ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES, FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW REVENUE STREAMS BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL CARD AND TRAVEL

BUSINESSES. ENTERPRISE GROWTH SEEKS TO LEVERAGE OUR ASSETS AND CAPABILITIES AND BUILD OR ACQUIRE THE TALENT, BUSINESSES AND PLATFORMS REQUIRED TO DELIVER NEW FORMS OF GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THE GROUP CONSISTS OF THREE CORE BUSINESS UNITS.

ONLINE AND MOBILE, FEE BASED SERVICES AND GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS GLOBAL PREPAID). STARTING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS LOYALTYEDGE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES (FORMERLY KNOWN AS GLOBAL

FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES) THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MANAGED AND REPORTED IN THE USCS AND GCS OPERATING SEGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, ARE NOW MANAGED BY ENTERPRISE GROWTH. THE GROUP ALSO INCLUDES THE CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION (THE COMPANYS

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS GROUP), AS WELL AS SERVE VIRTUAL ENTERPRISES, INC. OR SERVE (FORMERLY KNOWN AS REVOLUTION MONEY).

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS

THE ONLINE AND MOBILE BUSINESS UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING NEW ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENT CAPABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES THAT CAN EXPAND THE ROLE WE PLAY IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. IN 2011, WE

LAUNCHED SERVE

®

IN THE UNITED STATES AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DELIVERING MORE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT OPTIONS. SERVE

IS A NEW DIGITAL SOFTWARE-BASED PLATFORM WHERE CONSUMERS CAN SPEND, SEND AND RECEIVE MONEY, AND MAKE PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENTS ONLINE AT SERVE.COM, VIA MOBILE PHONES AND AT MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. SERVE UNIFIES MULTIPLE PAYMENT

OPTIONS INTO A SINGLE ACCOUNT THAT CAN BE FUNDED FROM A BANK ACCOUNT, DEBIT, CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD, OR BY RECEIVING MONEY FROM ANOTHER SERVE ACCOUNT. SINCE ACQUIRING SERVE, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO TRANSITION IT INTO AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE PLATFORM TO

SUPPORT FUTURE DIGITAL INITIATIVES.

FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH OF SERVE, WE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE MOBILE,

E-COMMERCE, NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND GAMING SPACE TO BUILD CAPABILITIES AND DRIVE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SERVE PLATFORM. WE ARE FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH PARTNERS THAT HAVE LARGE CUSTOMER BASES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM EMBEDDING SERVE DIRECTLY INTO THEIR

PURCHASE PATH AND ROLLING OUT EASY-TO-USE DIGITAL PAYMENT SOLUTIONS FOR CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES AND SELLERS. WE ALSO MADE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN 2011 TO OBTAIN CAPABILITIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE SERVE PLATFORM AND DRIVE

CUSTOMER GROWTH, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF SOMETRICS, A VIRTUAL CURRENCY PLATFORM AND IN-GAME PAYMENTS PROVIDER.

THE TEAM

IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA. THE TEAM IS IDENTIFYING MARKET STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE INTRODUCING NEW PAYMENT FORMS OUTSIDE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMBRACING NEW

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES, AND FORMULATING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS TO GENERATE NEW, INTERNATIONAL REVENUE STREAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2011 WE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE LIANLIAN GROUP, WHICH INCLUDES A MOBILE TOP-UP COMPANY IN

CHINA, AND AN OPERATING AGREEMENT TO USE SERVE IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LIANLIAN DEVELOPS FOR ITS CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN CHINA.

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS  COMPETITION

THE ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS SECTOR IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPETITORS THAT OFFER OR ARE DEVELOPING PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN E-COMMERCE AND ACROSS MOBILE DEVICES,

INCLUDING

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS, AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVIDERS, SUCH AS PAYPAL AND GOOGLE WALLET, AND OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS, SUCH AS

MOBILE OPERATORS, HANDSET MANUFACTURERS, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND OTHERS. AMONG OTHER SERVICES, THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE OR ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP DIGITAL PAYMENT SERVICES THAT CAN BE USED TO BUY AND SELL GOODS ONLINE, AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT

PAYMENTS TO AND FROM DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS OR PROPRIETARY ACCOUNTS FOR DIGITAL, MOBILE COMMERCE AND OTHER APPLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS RELY PRINCIPALLY ON THE INTERNET AND POTENTIAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TO SUPPORT THEIR SERVICES, AND

MAY ENJOY LOWER COSTS THAN WE DO. OTHER COMPETITORS WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES MAY HAVE AND MAY DEPLOY SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE OR MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES AND

CAPABILITIES THAN WE OFFER. CONSUMER AND MERCHANT ADOPTION IS A KEY COMPETITIVE FACTOR AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP PLATFORMS OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT BECOME MORE WIDELY ADOPTED THAN OURS. MICRO-PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL TODAY

BUT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GROW RAPIDLY, REPRESENTING THE POTENTIAL FOR COMPETITION FROM A NEW PAYMENT FORM. COMPETITION WILL REMAIN FIERCE AS PAYMENT SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

FEE BASED SERVICES

THE

FEE BASED SERVICES TEAM WITHIN ENTERPRISE GROWTH IS TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING WAYS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE EXISTING ASSETS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BY CREATING BUSINESS MODELS THAT CAN GENERATE NEW, NON-PAYMENT, E-COMMERCE REVENUE STREAMS. THE FEE BASED

SERVICES TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING OUR LOYALTYEDGE OFFERING, A NEW BUSINESS LINE THAT ASSISTS PARTNERS, LIKE DELTA AIR LINES, WITH DEVELOPING, OPERATING AND IMPROVING THEIR OWN LOYALTY PROGRAMS. IN 2011, WE LAUNCHED THE EXCLUSIVE ONLINE

RETAIL SITE, WWW.VENTEPRIVEE.COM, A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN AMERICAN EXPRESS AND VENTE-PRIVEE.COM, EUROPES LEADER IN ONLINE PRIVATE SALES OF LUXURY GOODS. THE SITE FEATURES MEMBER-ONLY SALES EVENTS WITH PREMIUM EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN BRANDS.

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS GLOBAL PREPAID)

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS (GPO) OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF PREPAID AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ACROSS THE GLOBE, INCLUDING BOTH RELOADABLE AND NON-RELOADABLE PREPAID PAYMENT PRODUCTS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

STATES A VARIETY OF PREPAID CARDS, INCLUDING REBATE, INCENTIVE AND REWARD PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS PREPAID RELOADABLE CARDS MARKETED THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS AND TO VARIOUS SEGMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, PASS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

, A PREPAID RELOADABLE CARD, IS SOLD AND MARKETED TO PARENTS AS A PAYMENT TOOL FOR TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS THAT IS AN

ALTERNATIVE TO CHECKS, CASH OR DEBIT CARDS. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

PREPAID CARD

IN 2011, A RELOADABLE PREPAID CARD WITH NO ACTIVATION OR MAINTENANCE FEES. WITH THIS EVERYDAY PAYMENT CARD WE HOPE TO SERVE NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO MANAGE DAY-TO-DAY FINANCES. WE ALSO LAUNCHED

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR TARGET CARD, A RELOADABLE PREPAID CARD, IN MORE THAN 1,000 U.S. TARGET STORES. OTHER EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTS WE HAVE LAUNCHED WITH RELOADABLE PREPAID CARD FUNCTIONALITY IF ACTIVATED INCLUDE A PILOT UNIVERSITY STUDENT ID CARD

AND A AAA MEMBERSHIP CARD.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF ISSUING AND SELLING TRAVELERS

CHEQUES SINCE 1891. WE SELL THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

TRAVELERS CHEQUE (TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR

CHEQUE) AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND FOUR FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS. WE ALSO ISSUE AND SELL OTHER FORMS OF PAPER TRAVELERS CHEQUES, INCLUDING

AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CHEQUES (GIFT CHEQUES), WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN U.S. AND CANADIAN

DOLLARS. SALES OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2011. WE ALSO ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE RELOADABLE PREPAID TRAVEL CARDS IN DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS IN AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA.

WE SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PREPAID PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS GLOBALLY, INCLUDING SALES DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS VIA THE INTERNET.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF SELLING OUTLETS ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES, THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND SELECT INDEPENDENT AGENTS. GIFT CARDS ARE AVAILABLE AT AMERICANEXPRESS.COM, IN MALLS AND RETAIL LOCATIONS AND IN BANK BRANCHES. RELOADABLE PREPAID PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE IN

CERTAIN RETAIL CHANNELS AS WELL AS ONLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES DIVISION (FES) OF

GPO CONSISTS OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AND THE FX INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS SERVICE. OTHER THAN IN AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE, WHERE WE OPERATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OFFICES IN CITY LOCATIONS AND THROUGH SELECTED PARTNER LOCATIONS, WE

CONCENTRATE OUR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS, SUCH AS MULTIPLE AIRPORT LOCATIONS IN EUROPE (LONDON HEATHROW, EDINBURGH, GLASGOW, MADRID, VIENNA, GENEVA AND NICE). IN 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THE EXPANSION OF OUR AIRPORT

PORTFOLIO TO INCLUDE BIRMINGHAM (U.K.), COPENHAGEN AND BOSTON LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS. OUR ONLINE FX INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS SERVICE ALLOWS COMPANIES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (AND CONSUMERS, IN THE CASE OF AUSTRALIA) TO MAKE CROSS-BORDER

PAYMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS  COMPETITION

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS INCLUDING CASH, FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF

TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT, PREPAID AND ATM CARDS, STORE BRANDED GIFT CARDS, OTHER NETWORK BRANDED CARDS AND OTHER PAYMENT CARDS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PREPAID SECTOR VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT, BUT SOME ARE.



NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE FORM OF PAYMENT



AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT



AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER



COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS



ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS



SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR LOST OR STOLEN INSTRUMENTS

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS  REGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS AND A PROVIDER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK

LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS, AS WELL AS PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES, TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD

OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT

SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY.

IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AML REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS AND THE PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND

COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE AML RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND AML REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY

WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS, UNDER WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK OR PREPAID CARD THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT. IN RECENT

YEARS, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING SHORTER PERIODS FOR TRAVELERS CHECKS AND/OR PREPAID CARDS, OFTEN WITH RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. WE HAVE CHALLENGED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE, WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT

DEFECTS IN THESE LAWS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS BUSINESS IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE ENACTED.

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT AMENDED PROVISIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE TERMS OF GIFT CARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PREPAID CARDS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEES

THAT MAY BE CHARGED, EXPIRATION DATES, AND CONSUMER DISCLOSURES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2010. CONGRESS THEREAFTER PASSED LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED

THE AUGUST 2010 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS TO JANUARY 2011 FOR GIFT CARDS PRODUCED PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2010, PROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE TERMS OF

GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS, WE HAVE LIMITED OR WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING THESE CARDS.

IN JULY 2011, THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK (FINCEN), AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURY, ISSUED THE PREPAID ACCESS FINAL RULE, WHICH IMPOSES NEW AML REQUIREMENTS ON THE PREPAID INDUSTRY. THE REGULATION BECOMES EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2012; HOWEVER, WE HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AS SOON AS

PRACTICABLE. IN GENERAL, THE REGULATION WILL REQUIRE ISSUERS OF PREPAID ACCESS (FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS STORED VALUE) PRODUCTS TO IDENTIFY CUSTOMERS AND RETAIN INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THE CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION AND IDENTIFY AND

REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE REGULATION DOES NOT IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT NEW OBLIGATIONS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS AS A PROVIDER OF PREPAID ACCESS BECAUSE OUR EXISTING AML PROGRAM ALREADY REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING OF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS,

CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION AND RETENTION OF CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION AND TRANSACTIONAL RECORDS.

SEE GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVES RULES UNDER DODD-FRANK THAT ESTABLISH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATION RULES FOR DEBIT AND PREPAID CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND

THAT PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS (WHICH APPLIES TO ALL DEBIT AND PREPAID CARDS).

THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP

THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP (GLOBAL

UNIT, WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS WILL STREAMLINE COSTS, REDUCE DUPLICATION OF WORK, BETTER INTEGRATE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GLOBAL SERVICES COMPRISED PRINCIPALLY THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS.

WORLD SERVICE

OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER WORLD SERVICE. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE UNITS HAVE WORKED

OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS TO ENSURE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, WHILE AT THE SAME

TIME IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES RELEASED ITS ANNUAL NATIONWIDE CREDIT CARD SATISFACTION STUDY AND RANKED AMERICAN EXPRESS HIGHEST IN OVERALL

SATISFACTION AMONG 10 OF THE LARGEST CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.

GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES

THE GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES DIVISION COMPRISED PRINCIPALLY PROCUREMENT, REAL ESTATE, HUMAN RESOURCES PROCESSING, AND

FINANCIAL PROCESSING. THESE INTERNAL PROCESS-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED TO SIMPLIFY AND STANDARDIZE PROCESSES FOR INCREASED QUALITY, EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS.

GLOBAL CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

GLOBAL CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

(GCA) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END-TO-END MANAGEMENT OF OUR CREDIT, COLLECTIONS AND FRAUD OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. GCA AIMS TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN HELPING CARDMEMBERS IN NEED THROUGH A RANGE OF WORKOUT PROGRAMS, AND TAKING

ACTIONS TO PREVENT SPENDING THAT WILL NOT BE PAID BACK TO AMERICAN EXPRESS.

TECHNOLOGIES

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF

PRODUCTS, WHILE MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER DATA. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM

THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER

SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS IN REVOLVING CREDIT.

WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DATA INTEGRITY, INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY. OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION

RETAINS OUR KEY TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, WHILE OUTSOURCING MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS. THIS ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM THIRD-PARTY EXPERTISE AND LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS PER TRANSACTION. WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR

INTERNAL POLICIES, AS DESCRIBED UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL  PRIVACY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING BELOW.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. AS OF THE END OF 2011, CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILLION CARDS GLOBALLY IN

OUR ONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY KNOWN AS THE MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW ALL OF THEIR CARD TRANSACTIONS ONLINE, PAY THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE

REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS, LOAN DOCUMENTATION,

CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET GROWTH AND IMPAIRED ASSETS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF DEPOSITORS, OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS, AS WELL AS TO MINIMIZE SYSTEMIC

RISK, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008, SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE, AND NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN

PROMULGATED.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 AND HAVE

ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION

ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF

THE COMPANYS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPLICABLE. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL

FINES, LIMIT DIVIDENDS, RESTRICT OPERATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, AND REQUIRE DIVESTITURES. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS SUBSIDIARIES OF BOTH, ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN PRACTICES THAT THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITY DEEMS

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND. THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION, EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE CFPB WITH RESPECT TO MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH

CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER LAWS, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT AND THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW UNDER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010.

MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF

2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS

ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND

CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURES THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY

REGIME IN THE UNITED STATES. DODD-FRANK CREATED A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC), WHICH OVERSEES AND COORDINATES THE EFFORTS OF THE PRIMARY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES

(INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE OCC AND THE FDIC) IN ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL STABILITY CONCERNS. DODD-FRANK DIRECTS THE FSOC TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

FEDERAL RESERVE AS TO SUPERVISORY REQUIREMENTS AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDES THE COMPANY, AND NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES DESIGNATED BY THE

FSOC FOR SUPERVISION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. DODD-FRANK MANDATES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THESE INSTITUTIONS BE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE FSOC, DODD-FRANK BROADLY AFFECTS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS, INCLUDING BY CREATING A SPECIAL RESOLUTION AUTHORITY, BY REQUIRING BANKS TO PAY INCREASED FEES TO REGULATORY AGENCIES, BY REQUIRING ALL PUBLICLY TRADED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE ASSETS OF AT LEAST

$10 BILLION TO ESTABLISH A DEDICATED RISK COMMITTEE REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS) RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND PRACTICES, AND THROUGH NUMEROUS

OTHER PROVISIONS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SOUND OPERATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOREOVER, TITLE X OF DODD-FRANK, KNOWN AS THE CONSUMER

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

IN RISK FACTORS BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES MAY HAVE ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010

AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE CFPA PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE CFPB, A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATOR. AS OF JULY 21, 2011, OUR MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR

COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE CFPA AND THE TILA, BECAME SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE CFPB. ON JULY 21, 2011, THE CFPB ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FROM OUR CURRENT BANKING REGULATORS FOR

SUPERVISION, EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS AND THEN-EXISTING REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THOSE LAWS. THE CFPB HAS AUTHORITY TO

TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST US FOR VIOLATION OF THOSE LAWS. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

DODD-FRANK ALSO

TRANSFERRED TO THE CFPB EXCLUSIVE RULEMAKING AUTHORITY FOR SUCH FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS AND AUTHORIZED THE CFPB TO PROHIBIT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MARKETS

FOR CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THAT SUCH MARKETS ARE FAIR, TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE. ON JANUARY 4, 2012, THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE RECESS APPOINTMENT OF A DIRECTOR OF THE CFPB.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NONBANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. UNLESS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY HAS QUALIFIED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, ITS NONBANKING ACTIVITIES ARE RESTRICTED TO

THOSE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DETERMINED ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER INCIDENT THERETO. AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY ELECT TO BE A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE IN A BROADER

RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE, INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY

TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY. AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE

ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, PROVIDING TRAVEL AGENCY SERVICES, ACTING AS A FINDER AND ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND AGENCY SERVICES.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS

SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT ASSESSMENT UNDER

THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977 (THE CRA). IF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MEET APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, IT COULD BE BARRED FROM ENGAGING IN NEW TYPES OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES OR MAKING

CERTAIN TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN RELIANCE ON ITS STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO EITHER DISCONTINUE THE BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES PERMITTED TO FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES OR DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK CREATED A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FSOC, TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK IMPOSES

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE LIMITS, LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, RESOLUTION PLANS (REFERRED TO AS LIVING

WILLS), STRESS TESTS, EARLY REDEMPTION, CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORTING AND CONCENTRATION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS ON ITS OWN OR AT THE FSOCS RECOMMENDATION REGARDING

CONTINGENT CAPITAL, ENHANCED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES, SHORT-TERM DEBT LIMITS AND OTHERWISE AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, ON ITS OWN VOLITION OR IN RESPONSE TO A RECOMMENDATION BY THE FSOC, TAILOR THE APPLICATION OF THESE

ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS TO SPECIFIC COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE ENHANCED STANDARDS ON THE COMPANY IS NOT CERTAIN.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING.



STRESS TESTING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST CONDUCT ANNUAL ANALYSES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL ON A TOTAL CONSOLIDATED BASIS NECESSARY TO ABSORB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (SO-CALLED STRESS TESTS). UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, THE STRESS TESTS

WOULD USE A MINIMUM OF THREE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SCENARIOS GENERATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE (BASELINE, ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE), AND BE BASED ON METHODOLOGIES AND DATA THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. A SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL

STRESS TESTS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON A COMPANY-SPECIFIC BASIS. THE COMPANY WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A SIMILAR STRESS TEST ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS, AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS ALSO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS DISCUSSED IN 

CAPITAL PLANNING

 BELOW. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE OTHER FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS TO ISSUE REGULATIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE STRESS TEST REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY APPLY TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN JANUARY 2012, THE FDIC AND THE OCC PUBLISHED PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS THAT

WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, RESPECTIVELY.



ENHANCED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

SEE BASEL III BELOW.



ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVES NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING STATES THAT THE ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS WILL BE

ADDRESSED IN STAGES. AS THE FIRST STAGE OF THIS UNDERTAKING, THE PROPOSED RULES FOCUS ON PRUDENTIAL STEPS TO MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH COMPREHENSIVELY DETAIL LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND WOULD REQUIRE.



MAINTENANCE OF A LIQUIDITY BUFFER, CONSISTING OF ASSETS MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS, THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROJECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS AND PROJECTED

LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES FOR 30 DAYS OVER A RANGE OF LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIOS;



PRODUCTION OF COMPREHENSIVE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS AND IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF DISCRETE AND CUMULATIVE CASH FLOW MISMATCHES;



REGULAR STRESS TESTING OF CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS OVER VARIOUS TIME HORIZONS AND ASSUMING PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS;

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS



ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN THAT SETS OUT STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING LIQUIDITY NEEDS DURING LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS;



ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF LIMITS ON POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING CONCENTRATIONS OF FUNDING, MATURITY OF SPECIFIED LIABILITIES

WITHIN VARIOUS TIME HORIZONS, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT COULD CREATE FUNDING NEEDS DURING LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS; AND



A VARIETY OF MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE NOTED THAT IT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE SECOND STAGE OF A REGULATORY LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS THROUGH

FUTURE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES OR A SUBSET THEREOF TO SATISFY SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS DERIVED FROM OR CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL LIQUIDITY STANDARDS INCORPORATED INTO THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK (DISCUSSED

BELOW).



SINGLE PARTY CONCENTRATION LIMITS.

UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2013, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS GENERALLY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A 25% LIMIT ON AGGREGATE NET CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY SINGLE UNAFFILIATED COUNTERPARTY.



ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.

UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A DEDICATED RISK COMMITTEE REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH WOULD DOCUMENT, REVIEW AND APPROVE THE ENTERPRISE-WIDE

RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY. THE RISK COMMITTEE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OVERSEE THE OPERATION OF AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RISK PROFILE, COMPLEXITY, ACTIVITIES,

SIZE AND OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK-RELATED FACTORS, AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THE PROPOSED RULE. SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO APPOINT A CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

BECAUSE THE PROPOSED RULE IS NOT FINAL, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE MEASURES ON US IS NOT CERTAIN.

DODD-FRANK ALSO MANDATES THAT CERTAIN EXPENSES OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE FSOC AND CERTAIN EXPENSES OF THE FDIC, BE FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE U.S. TREASURY PUBLISHED A PROPOSED RULE SETTING FORTH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSESSMENTS WOULD BE MADE.

LIVING WILLS

AS NOTED

ABOVE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE AND PROVIDE TO REGULATORS A RESOLUTION PLAN THAT MUST ENSURE THAT OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. THE PLAN MUST ALSO INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, A STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND STRATEGIES, AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERCONNECTIONS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG THE COMPANY AND ITS MATERIAL ENTITIES. PURSUANT TO A RULE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE FIRST

SUCH RESOLUTION PLAN FOR US IS REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND ANNUAL UPDATES WILL BE REQUIRED THEREAFTER. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION PLAN MAY, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, PRESENT ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON

TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN OUR BANK AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT OUR

ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CERTAIN OF OUR REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC. THE BANKING AGENCIES HAVE

BROAD DISCRETION IN EVALUATING PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND INVESTMENTS. IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE AN ACQUISITION, FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES MAY CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITION ON COMPETITION AND FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL

RESOURCES; FUTURE PROSPECTS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVELS; THE COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS; PUBLIC BENEFITS; THE CONVENIENCE AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY

AND OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRA; RISKS TO THE STABILITY OF THE U.S. BANKING OR FINANCIAL SYSTEM; AND OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT

MAY ACQUIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE

VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION; (THE BANK MERGER ACT REQUIRES REGULATORY APPROVAL BEFORE

A BANK SUBSIDIARY MAY MAKE SUCH AN ACQUISITION); OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING NON-U.S. INVESTMENT AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND

INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF AN INTEREST IN A NON-U.S. COMPANY, INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $50 BILLION TO PROVIDE THE FEDERAL

RESERVE WITH WRITTEN NOTICE (WHICH IS LARGELY TANTAMOUNT TO AN APPROVAL PROCESS) PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY (OTHER THAN AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION) THAT IS ENGAGED IN

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4(K) OF THE BHC ACT AND THAT HAS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $10 BILLION OR MORE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. DODD-FRANK ALSO REQUIRES FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE

APPROVAL PRIOR TO ACQUIRING ANY NONBANK COMPANY WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $10 BILLION.

THE CHANGE IN

BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM ACQUIRING CONTROL OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE COMPANY UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE AND HAS NOT

OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD GENERALLY CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE BHC ACT, ANY PERSON OR COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE ACQUIRING CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY. IN THE

CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE BANK OR BANK

HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ALL OF THEIR INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT BOTH INSTITUTIONS. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT THIS REQUIREMENT, WE OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT.

CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. THERE ARE TWO RISK-BASED MEASURES OF

CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE MEASURE.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY CALCULATES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BASED ON THE 1998 CAPITAL

ACCORD (BASEL I) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE BASEL COMMITTEE). THE U.S. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ADOPTED NEW RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES FOR CORE INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BASED UPON THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL II) ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN JUNE 2004 AND

UPDATED IN NOVEMBER 2005. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMMENCE CALCULATING THEIR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES, WHILE CONTINUING TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE BASEL

I-BASED GUIDELINES AS A FLOOR, NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2015, UNLESS FURTHER EXTENDED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE RELEASED ITS FINAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

REGULATION, KNOWN AS BASEL III. BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL THAN PRIOR

REQUIREMENTS, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK ALSO IMPACT THE COMPANYS REGULATORY CAPITAL. EACH BASEL FRAMEWORK IS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT AND MARKET RISK

PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURE, AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. CAPITAL RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A MINIMUM,

QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL CAPITALIZED. THE REQUIRED RATIOS TO QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED ARE A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIO OF AT LEAST 6% AND, FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. THE GUIDELINES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS

SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOLLOWING THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL

RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE THE WELL CAPITALIZED STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON EQUITY BE THE PREDOMINANT ELEMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. FURTHERMORE, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER A TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF CAPITAL STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW ACTIVITIES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS, SEE CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGES 27-29

OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BASEL I

THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB CURRENTLY CALCULATE REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL I, AS ADOPTED BY THE APPLICABLE

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. UNDER BASEL I, AS ADOPTED, THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS, SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF OF THE

TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, WHICH INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AND NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK (AND, UNDER EXISTING

STANDARDS, A LIMITED AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING TRUST

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREFERRED SECURITIES AND QUALIFYING CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL), LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST OF,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. DODD-FRANK APPLIES TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS THE COMPANY THE SAME RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. GOING FORWARD THIS WILL PRECLUDE A BANK HOLDING COMPANY FROM INCLUDING IN TIER 1 CAPITAL TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES OR CUMULATIVE

PREFERRED STOCK, IF ANY, ISSUED ON OR AFTER MAY 19, 2010 AND, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2013, TO PHASE OUT ALL TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK FROM INCLUSION IN THE COMPANYS TIER 1

CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RULES STATE THAT THE CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD CREDIT-RISK CONSIDERATIONS AND DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER TYPES OF RISK A BANKING ORGANIZATION MAY BE EXPOSED TO (E.G., INTEREST RATE, MARKET, LIQUIDITY

AND OPERATIONAL RISKS). THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, THEREFORE, SET HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORIES OF BANKS (E.G., SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS), OR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BANK, AS SITUATIONS WARRANT. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN

FACT EXPECTS LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND THEIR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS WELL IN EXCESS OF THESE MINIMUMS.

BASEL II

THE U.S. BASEL II FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

APRIL 1, 2008. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMMENCE CALCULATING THEIR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES, WHILE CONTINUING TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE BASEL I-BASED

GUIDELINES AS A FLOOR, BY JANUARY 1, 2015, UNLESS FURTHER EXTENDED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS. THE U.S. BASEL II-BASED RULES INITIALLY PROVIDED THAT CORE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY WOULD CALCULATE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

ONLY UNDER THE NEW BASEL II-BASED REQUIREMENTS AFTER COMPLETION OF THREE TRANSITIONAL FLOOR PERIODS, WHICH THEMSELVES COMMENCE AFTER A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN FOUR CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR QUARTERS DURING WHICH THE INSTITUTION

IS REQUIRED TO CONFIDENTIALLY REPORT REGULATORY CAPITAL UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I- AND BASEL II-BASED REGULATIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMMENCE THE FIRST TRANSITIONAL PERIOD NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2014, UNLESS THIS TIME IS FURTHER EXTENDED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC AND THE OCC.

IN RESPONSE TO A DODD-FRANK REQUIREMENT, THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES HAVE AMENDED THEIR

CAPITAL RULES TO PROVIDE THAT MINIMUM CAPITAL AS REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL I-BASED RULES WILL ACT AS A FLOOR FOR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S. BASEL II-BASED RULES. ACCORDINGLY, THE TRANSITION FOR

CORE INSTITUTIONS TO CALCULATIONS ONLY UNDER THE U.S. BASEL II-BASED RULES IS BEING ELIMINATED.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT

BASEL I AND BASEL II DO NOT INCLUDE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (AND, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, BASEL III WILL IMPOSE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD). THE FEDERAL RESERVES EXISTING GUIDELINES

PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE LEVERAGE RATIO), OF 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING

THE HIGHEST REGULATORY RATING. ALL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4%.

BASEL

III

THE BASEL III FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



INTRODUCES AS A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), SPECIFIES THAT TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CET1 AND

ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS MEETING SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS, DEFINES

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CET1 NARROWLY BY REQUIRING THAT MOST ADJUSTMENTS TO REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES BE MADE TO CET1 AND NOT TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, AND EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS AS COMPARED TO

EXISTING REGULATIONS



WHEN FULLY PHASED IN ON JANUARY 1, 2019, REQUIRES BANKS TO MAINTAIN.



AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 4.5%, PLUS A 2.5% CAPITAL CONSERVATION

BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 4.5% CET1 RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 7% (THERE IS NO COMPARABLE CET1 REQUIREMENT UNDER BASEL I OR II)



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 6.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 6.0%

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT IS 6.00% FOR A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK)



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL (THAT IS, TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 8.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION

BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT IS 10% FOR A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK)



AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3%, CALCULATED AS THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES

PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES (AS THE AVERAGE FOR EACH QUARTER OF THE MONTH-END RATIOS FOR THE QUARTER)



PROVIDES FOR A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, GENERALLY TO BE IMPOSED WHEN NATIONAL REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT EXCESS AGGREGATE CREDIT

GROWTH BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A BUILDUP OF SYSTEMIC RISK, WHICH WOULD BE A CET1 ADD-ON TO THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 2.5% WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED (POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN TOTAL BUFFERS OF BETWEEN 2.5% AND 5%)

THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IS DESIGNED TO ABSORB LOSSES DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC STRESS. BANKING

INSTITUTIONS WITH A RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ABOVE THE MINIMUM BUT BELOW THE CONSERVATION BUFFER (OR BELOW THE COMBINED CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER AND COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHEN THE LATTER IS APPLIED) WILL FACE CONSTRAINTS ON

DIVIDENDS, EQUITY REPURCHASES AND COMPENSATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE SHORTFALL.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III

FINAL FRAMEWORK WILL COMMENCE JANUARY 1, 2013. ON THAT DATE, BANKING INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS.



3.5% CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS



4.5% TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS



8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS

THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR A NUMBER OF NEW DEDUCTIONS FROM AND ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1. THESE INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AMONG

OTHERS, BE DEDUCTED FROM CET1 TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY ONE SUCH CATEGORY EXCEEDS 10% OF CET1 OR ALL SUCH CATEGORIES IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED 15% OF CET1. THE AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS THAT IS NOT DEDUCTED FROM CET1 WILL BE RISK WEIGHTED AT 250%.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1 WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL BE PHASED IN OVER

A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (20% PER YEAR). THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AT 0.625% AND BE PHASED IN OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD (INCREASING BY THAT AMOUNT ON EACH SUBSEQUENT JANUARY 1, UNTIL IT

REACHES 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019).

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE SUPPLEMENTED BASEL III BY ISSUING FINAL PROVISIONS

APPLYING A NEW CET1 SURCHARGE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (G-SIBS). IN A COMPANION RELEASE ADDRESSING PROGRESS ON A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORMS RELATING TO GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD RELEASED A LIST OF 29 SUCH INSTITUTIONS AND INDICATED THAT IT USED THE G-SIB SURCHARGE METHODOLOGY IN CREATING THE LIST. THE COMPANY WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE LIST AND DOES NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

A G-SIB.

AS NOTED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AFFECTING U.S. BANKING

INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS AND MANDATES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE ADOPT PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN

THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING

RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. THIS NOTICE INDICATED THE FEDERAL RESERVE INTENDS TO ADDRESS THE ENHANCED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE STANDARDS THROUGH A TWO-PART EFFORT, THE FIRST PART OF WHICH WOULD

REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CAPITAL PLAN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER 

CAPITAL PLANNING.

 THE RELEASE NOTED THAT THE SECOND PART WILL INVOLVE A

QUANTITATIVE RISK-BASED CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OR A SUBSET THEREOF, AND THAT THE FINAL CAPITAL SURCHARGE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES G-SIB SURCHARGE PROPOSAL PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER 2011.

HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOT YET ISSUED A DETAILED PROPOSAL FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A RISK-BASED CAPITAL SURCHARGE AND HAS NOT INDICATED WHICH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK. THUS, THE

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE AMENDMENTS TO BASEL III ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER 2011 ARE UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010.

LIQUIDITY RATIOS UNDER BASEL III

HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED FORMULAIC MEASURES. THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK REQUIRES BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO

LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, GOING FORWARD WILL BE REQUIRED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS EQUAL TO THE ENTITYS EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR A 30-DAY TIME HORIZON (OR, IF GREATER, 25% OF ITS EXPECTED TOTAL CASH OUTFLOW) UNDER AN ACUTE

LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. THE OTHER TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR), IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THESE

REQUIREMENTS WILL INCENT BANKING ENTITIES TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND OTHER SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE.

THE BASEL III LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATES THAT THE LCR WILL BE SUBJECT TO AN OBSERVATION PERIOD CONTINUING THROUGH MID-2013 AND,

SUBJECT TO ANY REVISIONS RESULTING FROM THE ANALYSES CONDUCTED AND DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, IMPLEMENTED AS A MINIMUM STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2015. SIMILARLY, IT CONTEMPLATES THAT THE NSFR WILL BE SUBJECT TO AN OBSERVATION

PERIOD THROUGH MID-2016 AND, SUBJECT TO ANY REVISIONS RESULTING FROM THE ANALYSES CONDUCTED AND DATA COLLECTED DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, IMPLEMENTED AS A MINIMUM STANDARD BY JANUARY 1, 2018.

THE FEDERAL RESERVES PROPOSED HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE OF

CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) THAT DO NOT MEET

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL TIER DEPENDS UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A

CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE

CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF

BROKERED DEPOSITS INCLUDING CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED

DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS PART OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2011 WERE ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS, A SUITE OF DEPOSIT PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AEBFSB. FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT PROGRAMS, SEE DEPOSIT PROGRAMS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES  CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES ABOVE AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS ON PAGE 31 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN UP TO AN AMOUNT

EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5% OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING ORDERS TO

SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPOINTMENT OF A

RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING THAT INCLUDED A PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION SYSTEM BASED IN PART ON THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME THAT CURRENTLY APPLIES TO INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FDIA. THE PROPOSED RULE

ESTABLISHES INCREASINGLY SEVERE REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS WITH FORWARD-LOOKING TRIGGERS BASED ON CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST REQUIREMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. BECAUSE THESE RULES ARE NOT

YET FINAL, THEIR ULTIMATE IMPACT ON US IS NOT CERTAIN.

CAPITAL PLANNING

PURSUANT TO A FINAL RULE PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN NOVEMBER 2011, BEGINNING IN 2012, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR

MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A SO-CALLED CAPITAL PLAN, AND TO SUBMIT THE CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CAPITAL PLAN MUST COVER A PLANNING HORIZON OF AT LEAST NINE QUARTERS (BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER PRECEDING THE SUBMISSION OF THE PLAN) AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.



AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS EXPECTED USES AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS SIZE, COMPLEXITY, RISK PROFILE AND SCOPE OF OPERATIONS, AND UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE;



A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PROCESS FOR ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, INCLUDING HOW IT WILL, UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL

CONDITIONS, MAINTAIN CAPITAL COMMENSURATE WITH ITS RISKS, ABOVE THE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS, AND TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, AND SUFFICIENT TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS BY MAINTAINING STEADY ACCESS TO

FUNDING, MEETING OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AND CONTINUING TO SERVE AS A CREDIT INTERMEDIARY;



THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL POLICY; AND



A DISCUSSION OF ANY EXPECTED CHANGES TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BUSINESS.

EACH CAPITAL PLAN MUST CONSIDER A MINIMUM OF FOUR PLANNING SCENARIOS, INCLUDING SEPARATE BASELINE AND STRESSED SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE STRESSED SCENARIO DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE 2012 PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT AN OUTCOME THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, IS UNLIKELY, BUT COULD OCCUR IF THE U.S.

ECONOMY WERE TO EXPERIENCE A DEEP RECESSION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES WERE ALSO TO CONTRACT SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS SCENARIO ASSUMES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNEMPLOYMENT WILL RISE TO 13% IN 2013, HOUSING PRICES WILL

DECLINE BY A FURTHER 20%, AND THE U.S. EQUITY MARKETS WILL DECLINE BY MORE THAN 50% AS COMPARED TO LEVELS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.

A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR A DESIGNATED COMMITTEE THEREOF, IS REQUIRED, AT LEAST ANNUALLY, TO REVIEW THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PROCESS FOR

ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, ENSURE THAT ANY DEFICIENCIES ARE REMEDIED AND APPROVE THE CAPITAL PLAN.

IN ITS REVIEW OF THE

CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONSIDER THE PLANS COMPREHENSIVENESS, THE REASONABLENESS OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS, AND THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS METHODOLOGIES FOR REVIEWING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS AND

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL ABOVE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING HORIZON. BASED ON ITS REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL EITHER OBJECT OR NOT OBJECT TO THE CAPITAL PLAN. THE FEDERAL RESERVE

HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO OBJECT TO CAPITAL PLANS, AND TO REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR CAPITAL PLANS FOR APPROVAL. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN ONGOING REQUIREMENT TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR CAPITAL

PLANS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS SPECIFIED BY RULE, OR WHEN REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE

HAS INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF ITS REVIEW OF THE PORTION OF EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN THAT RELATES TO THE STRESS SCENARIO DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED WILL INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPANY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT PROJECTED POST-STRESS CAPITAL RATIOS AND THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THESE RATIOS OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS, AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ARE

LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISORY POLICY IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANKING LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION TO

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING

PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND TRS TO

SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT IS FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY SHOULD PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ONLY OUT OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION APPEARS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE HAS LIMITED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO LESS THAN 50% OF EARNINGS. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IS SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN THE CAPITAL PLAN REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER



CAPITAL PLANNING

. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES FINAL RULE RELATING TO CAPITAL PLANS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE COMPANY GENERALLY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE IT CAN MAKE

CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, UNDER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION IS PART OF A CAPITAL PLAN TO WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOT OBJECTED).



THE COMPANY WILL NOT MEET A MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIO OR A TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY RATIO OF AT LEAST 5% AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTION;



THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT HAS DETERMINED THAT EITHER (I) THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE

CHANGE TO THE COMPANYS CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY STRUCTURE, OR (II) THE COMPANYS EARNINGS ARE MATERIALLY UNDERPERFORMING PROJECTIONS;



THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL EXCEED THE PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANYS APPROVED CAPITAL PLAN; OR



THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL OCCUR AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT REQUIRING THE RESUBMISSION (OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO AN OBJECTION) OF THE

COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN AND BEFORE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ACTED ON THE RESUBMITTED PLAN.

SUCH PRIOR

APPROVAL IS NOT REQUIRED FOR CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS THAT ARE WELL CAPITALIZED, PROVIDED THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION DOES NOT EXCEED ONE PERCENT OF SUCH COMPANYS TIER 1

CAPITAL, THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH AT LEAST 15 CALENDAR DAYS NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION, AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES NOT OBJECT. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT CAPITAL PLANS IMPLYING DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS

ABOVE 30% OF PROJECTED AFTER-TAX NET INCOME WILL RECEIVE PARTICULARLY CLOSE SCRUTINY.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED TEMPORARY GUIDANCE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND TRS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED CAPITAL BASE, INCLUDING ACTIONS SUCH

AS INCREASING DIVIDENDS. IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THAT CERTAIN COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WOULD CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS TEMPORARY GUIDANCE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED AN OBJECTION OR

NON-OBJECTION NOTICE REGARDING THE CAPITAL PLAN DUE IN JANUARY 2012. ON JANUARY 9, 2012, WE SUBMITTED OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN AND EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY MARCH 15, 2012.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS

SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

CAPITAL PLANNING

. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS. WHILE FINAL

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES RELATED TO CAPITAL RATIOS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WE ESTIMATE THAT HAD THE NEW RULES (AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED) BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER

BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE BASEL III RULES WILL CHANGE OVER TIME BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET AS WELL AS BASED ON THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

BASEL III RULES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE

AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION

BANK AND AEBFSB, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

BY STATUTE AND FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2012, DODD-FRANK SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES THE PROCEDURE FOR SEEKING

EXEMPTIONS FROM THESE RESTRICTIONS. TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS AND THOSE DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND (DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND) IS FUNDED BY

ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC REQUIRED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, TO PREPAY THEIR ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL OF

2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009.

PRIOR TO DODD-FRANK, ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON AN INSTITUTIONS RISK

CATEGORY AND AMOUNT OF INSURED DEPOSITS. DODD-FRANK REQUIRED THE FDIC TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO BASE INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS ON THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE

ASSESSMENT PERIOD (THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE). THE FDIC RULE IMPLEMENTING THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE AND CHANGING THE ASSESSMENT RATE CALCULATION FOR LARGE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, BECAME EFFECTIVE

APRIL 1, 2011. THE NEW ASSESSMENT RATE CALCULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RATIO OF (1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE, (2) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED

BY ANOTHER INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE AND (3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE DO NOT APPLY SO LONG AS THE INSTITUTION IS WELL

CAPITALIZED AND HAS A COMPOSITE CAMELS RATING OF 1 OR 2. THE RULES PERMIT THE FDIC TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ASSESSMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS. THESE CHANGES, AND ANY FUTURE CHANGES TO DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DODD-FRANK ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO INCREASE THE RESERVE RATIO FOR THE

DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND FROM 1.15 PERCENT TO REACH A MINIMUM OF 1.35 PERCENT OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE SETTING THE INCREASED RESERVE RATIO AT

2 PERCENT. THIS INCREASE WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK ELIMINATED THE CEILING (1.5 PERCENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS) ON THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND MADE THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS FROM THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND BY THE FDIC DISCRETIONARY.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF

AN INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS, OR HAS VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF

DEPOSIT INSURANCE AT EITHER OF OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION

BANK OR AEBFSB, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS

DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR

OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE DEBT HOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM,

AND COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

ORDERLY

LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY UNDER DODD-FRANK

DODD-FRANK CREATES ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY (OLA), A RESOLUTION

REGIME FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE TREASURY SECRETARY MAY APPOINT THE FDIC AS RECEIVER TO LIQUIDATE SUCH A COMPANY IF THE COMPANY IS IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND PRESENTS A

SYSTEMIC RISK TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS DETERMINATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY MUST COME AFTER SUPERMAJORITY RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC AND CONSULTATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY WITH THE PRESIDENT. OLA IS

SIMILAR TO THE FDIC RESOLUTION MODEL FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING THE VERY BROAD POWERS GRANTED TO THE FDIC AS RECEIVER), WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO REFLECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES

AND TO REDUCE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS CLAIMS UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AND IN AN OLA PROCEEDING AS COMPARED TO DISPARITIES THAT WOULD EXIST IN THE RESOLUTION BY THE FDIC OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND WILL FUND OLA LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS THROUGH BORROWINGS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

TREASURY AND RISK-BASED ASSESSMENTS MADE, FIRST, ON ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE MORE IN THE RESOLUTION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IN LIQUIDATION TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS, AND SECOND, IF NECESSARY, ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IF AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION IS TRIGGERED, THE COMPANY COULD FACE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE

THE LEVEL OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.

CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISIONS

UNDER THE CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989

(FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC

ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE

CRA, WHICH IMPOSES AFFIRMATIVE, ONGOING OBLIGATIONS ON DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE CREDIT NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEIGHBORHOODS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFE AND SOUND OPERATION OF THE INSTITUTION. THE CRA REQUIRES AN INSTITUTIONS PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR, AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION PROCESS, TO ASSESS THE

INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CRA, AND ALSO TO TAKE SUCH ASSESSMENT INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING MERGER AND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND APPLICATIONS TO OPEN OR RELOCATE A BRANCH OFFICE. IN THE CASE OF A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND TRS, APPLYING FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN CONSIDERING THE

APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN

ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN

CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION. REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY

CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY, BROAD USE OF THE INTERNET AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD COLLECTION, DISSEMINATION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SECURITY BREACHES

AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS. OUR REGULATORY EXAMINERS ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY/ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE ADEQUATE TO INFORM OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR DATA COLLECTION

AND USE PRACTICES AND TO PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL DATA.

AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE PAYMENT ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN

2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FORMED THE PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION, TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH HELPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROCESS CARD PAYMENTS

PREVENT CREDIT/CHARGE CARD SECURITY BREACHES AND FRAUD THROUGH INCREASED CONTROLS AROUND DATA AND ITS EXPOSURE TO COMPROMISE.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. THE GLBA REQUIRES CONSUMER NOTICE OF A FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THE GLBA

DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT, WHICH REQUIRES (WITH

LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) OPT-IN CONSENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEIR DATA MAY BE DISCLOSED TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE GLBAS REQUIREMENTS TO SAFEGUARD CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND TO A GROWING NUMBER OF U.S.

STATE LAWS (INCLUDING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA) THAT IMPOSE BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA.

IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA

(COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE VARIOUS LAWS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN JULY 2010, WE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW BY RELEVANT EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES OUR DRAFT BINDING CORPORATE RULES

(BCR) FOR PROCESSING OF DATA WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP AND SUBMITTED FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WITH REGARD TO THE BCR APPLICATIONS DURING 2011. OUR BCR APPLICATIONS REMAIN UNDER REVIEW BY THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES, AND IF AND WHEN

APPROVED, THE BCRS WILL ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT BASIS ON WHICH TO TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA WITHIN OUR GROUP.

DURING 2010, THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSION ANNOUNCED AN UPCOMING REFORM OF THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CIRCULATED PRELIMINARY DRAFTS OF DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING A GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION, THAT POTENTIALLY MAY FORM THE

FUTURE BASIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNIONS DATA PROTECTION

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FRAMEWORK AND THAT, IF ENACTED, MAY AFFECT PARTIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THAT COLLECT AND/OR PROCESS THE PERSONAL DATA OF RESIDENTS OF MEMBER STATES AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE

REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS. THE PRELIMINARY DRAFT GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION PROPOSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A REQUIREMENT FOR PROMPT NOTICE OF DATA BREACHES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DATA SUBJECTS AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES, APPLYING

UNIFORMLY ACROSS SECTORS AND ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS REQUIREMENTS. IT IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS PROPOSAL WILL BE FORMALLY

RELEASED DURING 2012.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND AS MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER, REGULATOR AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A DATA

SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA BREACH

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY BREACH NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES.

WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND OUR INTERNAL

DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR OTHER FRAUD, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF

ACCESS TO CUSTOMER DATA BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR FUNCTION FOR THE COMPANY.

THE FCRA REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, FCRA PLACES RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND CREDITWORTHINESS INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR AFFILIATES.

THE FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FACT ACT. THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT

RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS

MECHANISMS TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF AFFILIATE SHARING AND OF MARKETING BY THE COMPANY AND OUR AFFILIATES, AND WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ENHANCE THESE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND A FAVORABLE CUSTOMER

EXPERIENCE.

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDED THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY

THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007 REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM

CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO

COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008, BUT THE FTC SUSPENDED ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 PENDING LEGISLATION TO CLARIFY THE LAWS SCOPE. ON DECEMBER 18, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE RED FLAG PROGRAM

CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2010 INTO LAW. OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA SECURITY AND FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS, ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW IDENTITY THEFT REQUIREMENTS.

THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO,

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY

FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED

TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FEDERAL

BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES. SINCE JULY 21, 2011,

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT SCORES TO RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES AND TO ADVERSE ACTION NOTICES OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FCRA. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES

IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR PRACTICES.

THE CARD ACT

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION KNOWN AS THE CARD ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN MAY 2009. THE CARD ACT REGULATES CREDIT

CARD BILLING PRACTICES, PRICING, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER PRACTICES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD ACT AND RELATED REGULATIONS PROHIBIT ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING IMPOSING A PENALTY INTEREST RATE OR LATE FEE,

UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. IT ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST APR AND THEN TO BALANCES WITH

LOWER APRS. IN ADDITION, THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN ACCOUNT IS SERIOUSLY DELINQUENT OR

COMPLETES A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT. THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES THAT PENALTY FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL.

THE CARD ACT

ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE WRITTEN POLICIES TO CONSIDER A CONSUMERS INCOME OR ASSETS AND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO OPENING AN ACCOUNT OR INCREASING A CREDIT LINE. IN ADDITION, APPLICANTS FOR NEW ACCOUNTS WHO ARE UNDER THE

AGE OF 21 MUST DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PERIODIC PAYMENTS. ON MARCH 18, 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED CLARIFICATIONS TO ITS RULES IMPLEMENTING THE CARD ACT, WHICH INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT APPLICANTS

WHO ARE 21 AND OVER MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MONTHLY MINIMUM PAYMENTS. ISSUERS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CONSIDER HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR ASSETS, BUT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME OR ASSETS OF THE APPLICANT. THIS RULE

MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR OUR CARDS THAT ARE APPROVED FOR APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUAL INCOME, EVEN THOUGH THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR APPROVAL.

THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THE OBLIGATION TO

PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY 2011 AND IS ONGOING. IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED BY THE CFPB. THEREFORE, THESE PROVISIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CARD ACT ALSO APPLY TO STORED VALUE AND PREPAID PRODUCTS SOLD ON OR AFTER AUGUST 22, 2010. IN

MARCH 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AMENDED ITS REGULATION E TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEES WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES, STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS ISSUED PRIMARILY FOR

PERSONAL USE. SUCH FEES MAY ONLY BE IMPOSED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PROHIBIT THE SALE OR ISSUANCE OF A GIFT CERTIFICATE, STORE GIFT CARD OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE OF LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER

EITHER THE DATE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD IS ISSUED OR THE DATE ON WHICH FUNDS WERE LAST LOADED. THE RULES ALSO REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO GIVE CONSUMERS A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD WITH AT LEAST

FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTIFICATE OR CARD EXPIRATION DATE, PROHIBIT ANY FEES FOR REPLACING AN EXPIRED CERTIFICATE OR CARD OR REFUNDING THE REMAINING BALANCE AS LONG AS THE UNDERLYING FUNDS REMAIN VALID, AND REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR ANY FEE OTHER THAN A DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEE.

WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO CARD PRODUCT

TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE CARD ACT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON OUR REVENUES, SOME UNCERTAINTY REMAINS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS (SUCH AS THE

REQUIREMENT TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES). THE CARD ACT MAY CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

AMERICAN EXPRESS IS SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING A FINANCIAL COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS HAVING A GLOBAL PRESENCE. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE MAJORITY OF AML REQUIREMENTS IS DERIVED FROM THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS IT HAS BEEN AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT. IN EUROPE, AML REQUIREMENTS ARE LARGELY THE RESULT OF COUNTRIES TRANSPOSING THE 3

RD

EUROPEAN UNION MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE (AND PRECEDING EU MONEY

LAUNDERING DIRECTIVES) INTO LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NUMEROUS OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND MEXICO, HAVE ALSO RECENTLY ENACTED NEW OR ENHANCED AML LEGISLATION AND PROMULGATED REVISED AML REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO AMERICAN

EXPRESS.

THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE THE EFFORTS OF EACH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

FROM BEING USED BY CRIMINALS TO HIDE THEIR ILLICIT PROCEEDS AND TO IMPEDE TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

ESTABLISH AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT, AT A MINIMUM, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ALL OF ITS BUSINESSES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH

ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO AML AND ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING INITIATIVES. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THAT EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES

FOR A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE DUE DILIGENCE AND, WHEN NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION, IS CONDUCTED AT ACCOUNT OPENING AND UPDATED, AS NECESSARY, THROUGH

THE COURSE OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP. THE GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY IS ALSO DESIGNED TO ENSURE THERE ARE APPROPRIATE METHODS OF MONITORING TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIPS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AND REPORTING

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL WITH REGARD TO AML AND

ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING ISSUES AND PROVIDES FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING TO ENSURE THAT THE GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATION

THE UNITED STATES HAS IMPOSED

ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT AFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH DESIGNATED FOREIGN COUNTRIES, NATIONALS AND OTHERS. THE UNITED STATES PROHIBITS U.S. PERSONS FROM ENGAGING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AS SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS, SUCH

AS TERRORISTS AND NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. THESE PROHIBITIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) AND ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE OFAC RULES. THE OFAC RULES PROHIBIT U.S.

PERSONS FROM ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH OR RELATING TO THE PROHIBITED INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY, REQUIRE THE BLOCKING OF ASSETS IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY HAS AN INTEREST, AND PROHIBIT TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY

SUBJECT TO U.S. JURISDICTION (INCLUDING PROPERTY IN THE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF U.S. PERSONS) TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY. BLOCKED ASSETS (E.G., PROPERTY OR BANK DEPOSITS) CANNOT BE PAID OUT, WITHDRAWN, SET OFF OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY

MANNER WITHOUT A LICENSE FROM OFAC. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE SANCTIONS COULD HAVE SERIOUS LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN JUNE 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC AND THE OTS JOINTLY ISSUED FINAL GUIDANCE ON SOUND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. THE FINAL GUIDANCE SETS

FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.

THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD (1) PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE

THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISKS, (2) BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND (3) BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ORGANIZATIONS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR OTHER BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS REVIEW OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE

INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE FINAL GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES.

ADDITIONALLY, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2011, THE FDIC APPROVED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK ON

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THE PROPOSED RULE IS TO BE A JOINT RULEMAKING BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC, THE OTS, THE SEC, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION, AND EACH MUST

INDEPENDENTLY APPROVE THE PROPOSED RULE BEFORE IT IS PUBLISHED FOR COMMENT. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $1 BILLION OR MORE (SUCH AS THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) WOULD BE

PROHIBITED FROM OFFERING INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING BY OFFERING EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION OR COMPENSATION THAT COULD LEAD THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS. ALL COVERED

INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FEDERAL REGULATORS WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED RULE AND ALSO TO MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR COVERED INSTITUTIONS WITH AT

LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED RULE REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 50% OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BE DEFERRED FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS AND PROVIDES FOR THE

ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO REFLECT ACTUAL LOSSES OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE THAT BECOME KNOWN DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A COVERED INSTITUTION WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS MUST IDENTIFY EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO EXPOSE AN INSTITUTION TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK, EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT THE INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION METHODS USED TO BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS FOR THE IDENTIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND APPROVE

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERING OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS FOR BALANCING RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS. THE FORM AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL RULE CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY DODD-FRANK AMENDMENTS TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE EXCHANGE

ACT) REQUIRING A NON-BINDING SAY-ON-PAY VOTE TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AT A SHAREHOLDERS MEETING AND A NON-BINDING SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY SIX YEARS TO DETERMINE THE FREQUENCY

OF SAY-ON-PAY VOTES. THESE VOTES MUST BE PROVIDED AT MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY 21, 2011. AT OUR MAY 2, 2011 ANNUAL MEETING, OUR SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN ANNUAL SAY-ON-PAY VOTE. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK REQUIRES PROXY

STATEMENT DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRING PAYMENTS TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL (GOLDEN PARACHUTES) IF SHAREHOLDERS ARE VOTING ON A MERGER OR SIMILAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS A SEPARATE

NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBJECT TO A SAY-ON-PAY VOTE.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE

CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES AND REGULATIONS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO

HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS AND THEIR KEY EMPLOYEES.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

(THE FCPA), THE UK BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OR OFFERING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS. THE FCPA PROHIBITS IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICAL PARTIES OR POLITICAL PARTY OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE

OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS OR AN IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE ANTI-CORRUPTION PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA ARE ENFORCED BY DOJ. THE FCPA ALSO REQUIRES US TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS STANDARDS, WHICH ARE ENFORCED BY

THE SEC. IN RECENT YEARS, DOJ AND SEC ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE UK BRIBERY ACT, WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN JULY 2011, ALSO PROHIBITS COMMERCIAL BRIBERY, THE RECEIPT OF A BRIBE, AND MAKES IT A CORPORATE OFFENSE TO FAIL TO PREVENT

BRIBERY BY AN ASSOCIATED PERSON, IN ADDITION TO PROHIBITING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FCPA, THE UK BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS CAN EXPOSE US AND/OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO POTENTIALLY SEVERE

CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES. THE RISK MAY BE GREATER WHEN WE TRANSACT BUSINESS, WHETHER THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS, IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER PERCEIVED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. WE HAVE RISK-BASED POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES, PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING, MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND PAYMENTS, AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETIES RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED.

HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, MAY FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 25 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES

101-103 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE

AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THEIR

LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION

WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT,

BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS

CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE RISK

RELATING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 36-37 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

UPON ADOPTION OF NEW GAAP GOVERNING CONSOLIDATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES), THE

COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST), A PREVIOUSLY UNCONSOLIDATED VIE, WHICH IS NOW CONSOLIDATED. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010, THE

SECURITIZED CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RELATED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED TO THIRD PARTIES BY THE LENDING TRUST ARE INCLUDED ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST (THE

CHARGE TRUST). THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING AFFECTED THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED IN DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY; INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIALS; CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME  VOLUME

REFER TO NOTE 22 SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS ON PAGE 97 IN THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CONCENTRATIONS, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, AND FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW THE COMPANY MANAGES CONCENTRATION EXPOSURES. CERTAIN DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN CATEGORIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(B)

INCLUDES CORPORATE CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES OF $725 MILLION FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, $21 MILLION FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND $12 BILLION FROM OTHER CORPORATE

INSTITUTIONS.

(C)

BECAUSE CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS HAVE NO PRESET SPENDING LIMIT, THE ASSOCIATED CREDIT LIMIT ON CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES IS NOT QUANTIFIABLE. THEREFORE, THE QUANTIFIED UNUSED

LINE-OF-CREDIT AMOUNTS ONLY INCLUDE THE APPROXIMATE CREDIT LINE AVAILABLE ON CARDMEMBER LOANS.

RISK ELEMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AMOUNTS OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EITHER NON-ACCRUAL, PAST DUE, OR

RESTRUCTURED, SEGREGATED BETWEEN U.S. AND NON-U.S. BORROWERS. PAST DUE LOANS ARE LOANS THAT ARE CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE AS TO PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST PAYMENTS. RESTRUCTURED LOANS AND CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES ARE THOSE THAT MEET THE

DEFINITION OF TDR.

(A)

THE INCREASE IN NON-PERFORMING LOANS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010 WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW GAAP, AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 60. AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, AMOUNTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR BOTH THE CHARGE TRUST AND LENDING TRUST; CORRESPONDINGLY, 2009 AND PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS ONLY INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR THE CHARGE TRUST AND THE SELLERS

INTEREST PORTION OF THE LENDING TRUST.

(B)

THE COMPANYS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO CEASE ACCRUING INTEREST INCOME ONCE A RELATED CARDMEMBER LOAN IS 180 DAYS PAST DUE AT WHICH TIME THE CARDMEMBER LOAN IS

WRITTEN OFF. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES LOAN LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST RECEIVABLE BALANCES PRIOR TO WRITE-OFF. FOR THE U.S., AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH

OUTSIDE COLLECTION AGENCIES.

(C)

REPRESENTS MODIFICATION PROGRAMS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS, WHEREIN THE TERMS OF A LOAN OR RECEIVABLE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FOR CARDMEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND A CONCESSION HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE BORROWER. SUCH MODIFICATIONS TO THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES MAY INCLUDE (I) REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE (AS LOW AS ZERO PERCENT, IN WHICH CASE THE LOAN IS CHARACTERIZED AS NON-ACCRUAL IN THE

COMPANYS TDR DISCLOSURES), (II) REDUCING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE (IN THE EVENT OF A SETTLEMENT), (III) SUSPENDING DELINQUENCY FEES UNTIL THE CARDMEMBER EXITS THE TDR PROGRAM, AND (IV) PLACING THE CARDMEMBER ON A FIXED PAYMENT

PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. UPON ENTERING THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THE CARDMEMBERS ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE PURCHASES IS EITHER CANCELLED, OR IN CERTAIN CASES SUSPENDED UNTIL THE CARDMEMBER SUCCESSFULLY EXITS THE TDR PROGRAM. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH THE CARDMEMBER, LOANS WITH MODIFIED TERMS WILL REVERT BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS (INCLUDING THEIR CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE) WHEN THEY EXIT THE TDR PROGRAM, EITHER (I) WHEN ALL

PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT OR (II) IN THE EVENT THAT A PAYMENT IS NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT AND THE CARDMEMBER DEFAULTS OUT OF THE PROGRAM.

IMPACT OF NON-PERFORMING LOANS ON INTEREST INCOME

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE GROSS INTEREST INCOME FOR BOTH NON-ACCRUAL AND RESTRUCTURED LOANS FOR 2011 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECOGNIZED IF SUCH LOANS HAD BEEN CURRENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND HAD BEEN OUTSTANDING THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OR SINCE ORIGINATION IF HELD FOR ONLY PART OF 2011. THE TABLE ALSO PRESENTS THE INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO

THESE LOANS THAT WAS ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED FOR THE PERIOD. THESE AMOUNTS ARE SEGREGATED BETWEEN U.S. AND NON-U.S. BORROWERS.

POTENTIAL PROBLEM RECEIVABLES

THIS DISCLOSURE PRESENTS OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC RESERVES FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE CREDIT PROBLEMS OF BORROWERS CAUSES MANAGEMENT TO HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS

TO THE ABILITY OF SUCH BORROWERS TO COMPLY WITH THE PRESENT REPAYMENT TERMS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS OR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THE CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO THAT WERE NOT

ALREADY INCLUDED IN RISK ELEMENTS ABOVE.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES

GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE FFIEC GUIDELINES FOR ITS CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE STARTING WITH 2009 REPORTING.

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND GUIDE 3 GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE ARE: I) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED BASED ON AMORTIZED COST FOR FFIEC INSTEAD

OF FAIR VALUE FOR GUIDE 3; II) NET LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS ARE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION) EXCLUDING ANY DEBT THAT IS FUNDING THE LOCAL ASSETS THROUGH A FOREIGN DOMICILED SUBSIDIARY FOR FFIEC COMPARED TO

GUIDE 3 WHERE ONLY AMOUNTS IN THE SAME CURRENCIES ARE OFFSET AND SUCH DEBT NOTED ABOVE IS A REDUCTION TO LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS; III) THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3; AND

IV) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED UNDER FFIEC BUT EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3.

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FROM

BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES FOR EACH FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT EXCEEDS 1 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS REPORTED BELOW. CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS INCLUDE LOANS, RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, OTHER

INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS AND OTHER MONETARY ASSETS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN EITHER DOLLARS OR OTHER NON-LOCAL CURRENCY.

THE TABLE SEPARATELY PRESENTS THE AMOUNTS OF CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS BY TYPE OF BORROWER INCLUDING GOVERNMENTS AND OFFICIAL

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THIS

SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE

INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD.

ONGOING CONCERNS OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE MORTGAGE AND

REAL ESTATE MARKETS, ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES AND MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF THE PERCEIVED CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE CURRENT CRISIS IN EUROPE WITH

RESPECT TO THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE THEIR SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THE UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS

FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAVE HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH OR A DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS TO REPLACE CASH EXPENDITURES.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL

AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS

LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS

AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF

CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL

ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, INTRUSION INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE

FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND

THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL

OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR

HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) WERE TO PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE

COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUING OR INCREASED ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND

CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

THE GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING

LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED

BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR CONDUIT FACILITY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS REGARDING BANKING,

MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES INTENDED TO PROMOTE OR MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND/OR STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR

DEMAND. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS HAS IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT CONCERNS REGARDING U.S. DEBT AND BUDGET MATTERS

AND THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE HAVE CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. DEBT LIMIT WAS INCREASED, A FAILURE TO RAISE THE U.S. DEBT LIMIT AND/OR A FURTHER DOWNGRADE OF U.S. DEBT RATINGS IN THE FUTURE COULD, IN ADDITION

TO CAUSING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS, MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, AS WELL AS HAVE OTHER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

CONDITION. THE IMPACT OF THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO

MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH OF OUR DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSIT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE IN THE EVENT OF A

DOWNGRADE IN CREDCOS SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND VOLATILITY IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT

CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE

GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR

RATINGS AGENCIES) AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR DEPOSITORS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY

DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIMILARLY, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR RATING AGENCIES

TAKE NEGATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST US. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO

LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR

BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY WORSEN,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES

ON PAGES 30-33 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING

TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE

ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ANY REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD

INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES,

THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES

REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT

ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE

RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TO OBTAIN NECESSARY CREDIT RATINGS FOR THEIR ISSUANCES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN BASED, IN

PART, ON QUALIFICATION UNDER THE FDICS SAFE HARBOR RULE FOR ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN SECURITIZATIONS. IN 2009 AND 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A SERIES OF CHANGES TO ITS SAFE HARBOR RULE, WITH ITS NEW FINAL RULE FOR ITS SECURITIZATION SAFE HARBOR,

ISSUED IN 2010, REQUIRING ISSUERS TO COMPLY WITH A NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE SAFE HARBOR. ISSUANCES OUT OF OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST ARE GRANDFATHERED UNDER THE NEW FDIC FINAL RULE. THE

TRUST FOR THE COMPANYS CARDMEMBER CHARGE RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION (THE CHARGE TRUST) DOES NOT SATISFY THE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY THE FDICS NEW SAFE HARBOR RULE, NOR DID IT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE COVERED BY

THE SAFE HARBOR RULE EXISTING PRIOR TO 2009. IT WAS STRUCTURED AND CONTINUES TO BE STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THE CHARGE TRUST WOULD NOT BE

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEEMED TO BE PROPERTY OF THE ORIGINATING BANKS IN THE EVENT THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR OF THE ORIGINATING BANKS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED CONFIRMATION FROM MOODYS,

S&P AND FITCH RATINGS, WHICH RATE ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST, THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RATE ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE COVERED BY

THE FDICS SAFE HARBOR RULE. NEVERTHELESS, ONE OR MORE OF THE RATING AGENCIES MAY ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFE HARBOR RULE, THE HIGHEST RATING A CHARGE TRUST SECURITY COULD RECEIVE WOULD BE BASED ON THE

ORIGINATING BANKS UNSECURED DEBT RATING. IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES COME TO THIS CONCLUSION, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS CAPACITY AND COST OF USING ITS CHARGE TRUST AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS BUSINESS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE COMPANYS

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CONTINUED CONCERNS REGARDING THE EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR CAPITAL.

DURING 2011, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE

ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONCERNS PERSIST REGARDING THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE THEIR SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE OVERALL

STABILITY OF THE EURO AND THE SUITABILITY OF THE EURO AS A SINGLE CURRENCY GIVEN THE DIVERSE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN INDIVIDUAL EUROZONE COUNTRIES. THESE CONCERNS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE EURO TO FLUCTUATE MORE WIDELY THAN IN THE

PAST AND COULD LEAD TO THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENCIES IN ONE OR MORE EUROZONE COUNTRIES, OR, IN MORE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POSSIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO CURRENCY ENTIRELY. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATION OF THE EURO AND

WE ARE UNABLE TO HEDGE OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE TO THE EURO, THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED WHEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR INCLUSION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SIMILARLY, THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES OR THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY

CURRENCIES WOULD REQUIRE US TO RECONFIGURE OUR BILLING AND OTHER SYSTEMS TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES IN PLACE OF THE EURO. IMPLEMENTING SUCH CHANGES COULD BE COSTLY AND FAILURES IN THE CURRENCY RECONFIGURATION COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN

OUR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE TO RE-INTRODUCED CURRENCIES MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US.

THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING EUROPE AND THE EURO, OR MARKET PERCEPTIONS CONCERNING THESE AND RELATED ISSUES, COULD CONTINUE TO

HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CONCERNS OVER THE EFFECT OF THIS

FINANCIAL CRISIS ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

LEGAL AND

REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE COMPANYS NON-DISCRIMINATION CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS COULD REQUIRE

CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES, SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE

COMPANYS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION,

ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS

ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARDS PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE COMPANYS

NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS. VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN LAWSUITS THAT INCLUDE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND/OR SURCHARGING-RELATED POLICIES AND RULES. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY, REQUIRE IT TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS

IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS TO STEERING OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARDMEMBERS EXPERIENCE, THREATEN THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND/OR DAMAGE

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF THE COMPANY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR REGULATORY

ACTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY.

PROTECTION ACT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN JULY 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW DODD-FRANK. DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES, REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY

AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, LIMITING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES THE COMPANY CAN CHARGE FOR SERVICES AND IMPACTING THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS CONTAINED IN

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL ABOVE.

DODD-FRANK HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF

CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CFPB WITHIN THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE CFPB HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND

AUTHORITY TO PREVENT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THE CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAWS, AND TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE FOR COMPLIANCE LARGE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IT IS ALSO AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT FINES AND PROVIDE CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST DATA AND PROMOTE

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. FOLLOWING A REVIEW BY THE FDIC AND THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF CENTURION BANKS CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTION

LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FDICS PROVIDING THE CFPB WITH INFORMATION THE FDIC CONSIDERED RELEVANT AND OBTAINED BY IT IN THE COURSE OF ITS REVIEW, THE FDIC NOTIFIED CENTURION BANK THAT IT PLANS TO TAKE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST IT,

AND IT APPEARS LIKELY THE CFPB AND THE DFI WILL TAKE SOME TYPE OF ACTION AGAINST CENTURION BANK AS WELL. SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

DEPENDING ON HOW THE CFPB FUNCTIONS AND ITS AREAS OF FOCUS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DELAYING OUR ABILITY

TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES, CFPB OVERSIGHT COULD RESULT IN REQUIREMENTS TO ALTER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. THE IMPACT THIS NEW

REGULATORY REGIME WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.

DODD-FRANK MANDATES THE FEDERAL RESERVE

TO ESTABLISH HEIGHTENED CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, CONCENTRATION LIMITS ON CREDIT EXPOSURES, LIVING WILLS AND STRESS TESTS FOR,

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMONG OTHERS, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE GREATER THAN $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, MOST INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WILL BE REQUIRED

TO BE EXCHANGE-TRADED, WHICH MAY INCREASE COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPANY.

PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, THE

RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE OTS TO SUPERVISE FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING AEBFSB, WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE OCC ON JULY 21, 2011. AS AEBFSB DEVELOPS A RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NEW REGULATOR, THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALIGNING AEBFSBS CURRENT COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE WITH THE OCCS EXPECTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE OTS TO THE OCC COULD RESULT IN NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS AS THE OCC HAS INDICATED THAT

CERTAIN OTS POLICY GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIVE REVISION AS PART OF THE TRANSITION PROCESS. ANY SHIFTS IN CURRENT REGULATORY POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS NOT DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN

ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION. THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2009 WILL

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CARD ACT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING, UNDERWRITING,

PRICING AND BILLING. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT DISCLOSURES, PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES TO ACCOUNT TERMS, AND RESTRICTS PENALTY FEES AND CHARGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY AN ISSUER. IN ADDITION, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THE OBLIGATION TO

PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY 2011 AND IS ONGOING, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED BY THE CFPB.

WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO CARD PRODUCT TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH, AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY, THE CARD ACT; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH

CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND

THE ACTIONS OF OUR COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME. IN THE EVENT THE CARD ACT CONSTRAINS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING OUR REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS

COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING

ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE. BANKING REGULATIONS ARE

PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPOSED WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR

ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF KEY COMPANY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING

INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER U.S. LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN

AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION TO PROPOSED LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY

OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF THE U.S. CONGRESS TO RENEW THE ACTIVE FINANCING EXCEPTION TO SUBPART F OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET

INCOME.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION TO WHICH WE

ARE SUBJECT.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THESE GUIDELINES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS

AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET GUIDELINES FOR CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, SUBJECT TO

QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL  FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY,

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRANSITION TO BASEL II AND

AS A RESULT OF BASEL III AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK. IF THE COMPANY, TRS OR OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE MINIMUM CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR OTHER FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL

CONDITIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN LIGHT OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS, DODD-FRANK AND BASEL III, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY ADDITIONAL, MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY

STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE FINAL FORM OF, OR THE EFFECTS OF, THESE REGULATIONS. FAILURE BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL

CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, WOULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY COMMON STOCK

DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL  FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL

ADEQUACY ABOVE.

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL

STOCK.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE

CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE

FOR REVIEW. GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE STATES THAT OUR DIVIDEND POLICIES WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS.

WHILE THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE

TO THE COMPANY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT, HAD REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL III WOULD HAVE

EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS

ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS STATED THAT IT WILL CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE ANY DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS EXCEEDING 30% OF

AFTER-TAX NET INCOME.

DURING 2011, WE REPURCHASED 48 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 9, 2012, WE SUBMITTED OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN (CCP) TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2012. THE CCP INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE AND CAPITAL

AVAILABILITY UNDER CERTAIN ADVERSE ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. WE EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY MARCH 15, 2012. NO ADDITIONAL SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPURCHASED PRIOR TO ITS RESPONSE. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE

WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL SHARE PURCHASES.

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY,

ALSO RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAW LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BANK HOLDING COMPANY

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL  DIVIDENDS ABOVE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON PAGE 29 AND NOTE 23 ON

PAGES 98-99 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND

CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A

PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND

LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW

TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED-VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD

NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO

AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL.

THE INTERCHANGE

FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO

MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD

NETWORKS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER

ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

DODD-FRANK

PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE

ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO

PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER

LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD

INTERCHANGE FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING A MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A

NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010,

VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY FORM OF PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS OR OTHER BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH,

CHECK, DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT OTHERS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO

LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE PRIVACY OR DATA SECURITY-RELATED LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON THE COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR

RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT

THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART

ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW

TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE SUCCESSFUL

IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARDMEMBERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE

TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR

INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, BY RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS, BY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OR BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT

PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES

INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, WE

CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS ISSUED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA

PROTECTION, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE GUIDELINES UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY

ACT. THE GLBA GUIDELINES REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY LAWS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS STATES, SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA. IN RECENT YEARS THERE ALSO HAS BEEN INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THE PRIVACY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA COULD

RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO

EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THEIR DATA PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN

INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL PRESENCE, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF

ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING ENHANCED DATA

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND AS MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REGULATIONS AND LAWS REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF

CONSUMER, REGULATORY AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH

KOREA, TAIWAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE

VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES. MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS; THUS, TO THE EXTENT THEY EXPERIENCE DATA SECURITY BREACHES, THIS PRESENTS

ADDITIONAL RISKS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OUR CARDMEMBERS.

IN ADDITION, FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS ARE INCREASINGLY

PURSUING NEW GUIDELINES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT, IF ADOPTED, COULD FURTHER RESTRICT HOW THE COMPANY COLLECTS, USES, SHARES AND SECURES CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, WHICH COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS

INITIATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, AN FTC DRAFT REPORT ISSUED IN 2010, WHICH APPLIES TO A COMPANYS COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE GREATER TRANSPARENCY, USE, DISCLOSURE AND CONSUMER

CHOICE OBLIGATIONS ON THE COMPANY, AND MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN THE CREATION OF AN ONLINE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH CONSUMERS COULD OPT OUT OF ALL ONLINE TRACKING FOR ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING PURPOSES. A COMPANION DRAFT REPORT BY THE UNITED

STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC) ISSUED IN 2010 WOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN THEIR ONLINE PRIVACY PRACTICES, AND RECOMMENDS THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH STANDARD. BOTH THE FTC AND THE DOC

ARE EXPECTED TO RELEASE FINAL REPORTS DURING 2012. ADDITIONALLY, VARIOUS DRAFT PRIVACY, DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION, CYBERSECURITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND IN THE SENATE DURING 2011

AND VARIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE HELD ON RELATED SUBJECTS, INCLUDING CONCERNING HIGHLY PUBLICIZED DATA SECURITY BREACHES. A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LEGISLATORS HAVE EITHER EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THESE DRAFT BILLS OR HAVE INDICATED THEIR INTENT TO

INTRODUCE NEW BILLS DURING 2012. IF ADOPTED, ANY SUCH PRIVACY, DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION, CYBERSECURITY AND/OR INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED BILL COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND PLANNED DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

PRACTICES AND USES OF PERSONAL DATA. THIS COULD ALSO INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

WE CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS AND COSTS INTERNALLY BY IMPROVING OUR OWN DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES, AND EXTERNALLY THROUGH REGULAR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PAYMENT CARD

INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARD AND BY PLACING STRONG CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, AS WELL AS ON OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, RELATING TO DATA SECURITY AND DATA BREACH. WE ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN

MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO CUSTOMER DATA BY EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE LEAST PRIVILEGED LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR FUNCTION FOR THE COMPANY. STILL,

INCREASED REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN THE AREAS OF DATA PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION, INCLUDING REGARDING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND MAY DECREASE THE

NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY, OR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY,

INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, COULD ALSO RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR

SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL  COMPENSATION

PRACTICES ABOVE, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC.

AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING

LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING

IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING

RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS, CASH, CREDIT

AND ACH, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS (E.G., PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS

LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST

COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING OF VISA AND MASTERCARD.

BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS.

CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS

FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP,

SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN

INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS COULD BE IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND

EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS.

IN

THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP

ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

TO THE EXTENT

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE

COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP FOCUSES ON THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS, BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, IN AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES.

WHILE EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMPANY, MANY OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS FOR THE COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY. OUR FAILURE TO EXPAND ENTERPRISE GROWTH AND

DRIVE ADOPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGY AND PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WE OFFER, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE GROWTH. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY FACE

COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. LAWS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS OR

PROHIBIT OR LIMIT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.

REGULATORS HAVE

RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND

PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND

SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE

PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS

VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL

PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO

OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH IF NOT SUCCESSFUL COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS AND

HAVE OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE AND ACTIVATION, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS

PROGRAMS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR

BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND

89

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE

REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND

REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM DROVE AN INCREASE IN THE ULTIMATE REDEMPTION RATE TO 92 PERCENT IN 2011 FROM 91 PERCENT IN 2010, WHICH

RESULTED IN HIGHER REWARDS EXPENSES IN 2011. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN

OUR PROGRAMS.

DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE RECEIVED QUARTERLY PAYMENTS FROM EACH OF VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH EACH COMPANY TO SETTLE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST THEM IN SEPARATE ANTITRUST ACTIONS. WE RECOGNIZED $186 MILLION AND $172 MILLION OF AFTER-TAX INCOME FROM MASTERCARD AND VISA, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2011 AND

$372 MILLION AND $172 MILLION OF AFTER-TAX INCOME FROM MASTERCARD AND VISA, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2010. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE PAYMENTS PROVIDED TO US UNDER OUR SETTLEMENTS WITH MASTERCARD AND VISA, WHICH HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL THROUGH THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS

PRACTICES, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS  EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS  COULD ERODE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG

EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A GNS PARTNER THAT ISSUES CARDS AND ACQUIRES MERCHANTS ON THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND VALUE. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN

GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS A CORPORATION WITH HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR OTHER

POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND

PROFITABILITY.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,

JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.

WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITIONS

OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, AND MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS REGARDING A WIDE ARRAY OF POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES, VALUE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ACCURATELY AND NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES,

COMPLETE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS, AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS OR EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS.

THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY, BUSINESS OR TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE, UNFORESEEN OPERATING

DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. THE AREAS WHERE WE FACE RISKS INCLUDE: IMPLEMENTATION

90

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR REMEDIATION OF CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES AT THE ACQUIRED COMPANY; DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND FOCUS FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES; COORDINATION

OF PRODUCT, ENGINEERING, AND SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS; TRANSITION OF OPERATIONS, USERS AND CUSTOMERS ONTO OUR EXISTING PLATFORMS; CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES FROM THE ACQUIRED COMPANY INTO OUR ORGANIZATION;

RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES FROM THE BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE; INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANYS ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCE AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS; LIABILITY FOR ACTIVITIES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY BEFORE THE

ACQUISITION, INCLUDING PATENT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, VIOLATIONS OF LAWS, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, TAX LIABILITIES AND OTHER KNOWN AND UNKNOWN LIABILITIES; LITIGATION OR OTHER CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUIRED COMPANY, INCLUDING CLAIMS

FROM TERMINATED EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES; IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS, THE NEED TO INTEGRATE OPERATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CULTURES AND LANGUAGES AND TO ADDRESS THE PARTICULAR ECONOMIC, CURRENCY,

POLITICAL AND REGULATORY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC COUNTRIES; AND FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY FURTHER DEVELOP THE ACQUIRED COMPANY, BUSINESS OR TECHNOLOGY.

OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS OR OTHER PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PAST OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF SUCH

ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF

OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS AND STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN

CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS, INCLUDING CYBER ATTACKS, TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO

ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEB SITES. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION OF FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY

INCREASE, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE COMPROMISED.

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO DETECT AND PREVENT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND

MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA

BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. FURTHERMORE, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION,

NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD, TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS OR DISRUPTIONS. SUCH FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS COULD LEAD TO AN INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE,

PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. SEE 

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS

TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED

 BELOW.

IF OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD

TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION AND REMEDIATION COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL

DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY,

THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED

WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY PROGRAM POINTS THAT WILL NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES,

LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM

MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. DURING 2011, THERE CONTINUED TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES

(E.G., UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES/AIRTRAN), THROUGH MERGERS AND/OR GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND JOINT VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES, ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC

AND OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING JOINTLY PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS

SIMILARLY APPROVED THE ONEWORLD ALLIANCE, AND ITS REVIEW OF THE OTHER ALLIANCES IS CONTINUING. INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANDED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES INCLUDING REDUCING OUR

PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE BUSINESS. FURTHER CONSOLIDATION MAY ALSO RESULT FROM AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH COULD BE AN OUTCOME OF AMERICAN AIRLINES PENDING CASE UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED

WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING

CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A MERGER

OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS OUR PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS OR THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM AS OF OCTOBER 1,

2011, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 36 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE

SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

MANY FACTORS CAN

INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENSES, AS WELL AS HOW QUICKLY THEY MAY INCREASE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS, MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES.

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE

REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS

INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER-COST

OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE

NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY

MANAGE OUR EXPENSES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL TARGETS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 35-38 OF OUR

2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, AS REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN

WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR

FORECASTING MODELS. IF THE MODELS WE USE TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE INADEQUATE, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR THAT DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR

MITIGATED.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS AND SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO

GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM

CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCP CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE LOSSES,

WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

ALTHOUGH DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2011, WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICAL LOWS IN THESE RATES AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE. IN ADDITION, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE, THESE RATES MAY INCREASE MORE

THAN EXPECTED. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS THAT

WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES

TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR

DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER RESULTING FROM UNDERESTIMATING THE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND

RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE, COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR LIABILITIES AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT

ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY

MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY

MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY; OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK,

SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL

 ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS) INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY OR LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS, EXPOSING US TO FINES AND/OR PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE

LEVEL AGREEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE

NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $37.3 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING

U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS PART OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2011 WERE

ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. MANY OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT DEPOSIT RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS

WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS

DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED

AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE

FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF

THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL

MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN

AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND

CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE

UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE

TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY PHASED IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON

EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR

MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

IF OUR

GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE

OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM, CLIMATE CHANGE OR ACCIDENT. A DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. TERRORISTS, ACTIVISTS OR HACKERS MAY ALSO ATTACK OUR FACILITIES OR SYSTEMS, LEADING TO

SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, INCREASED COSTS OR DATA SECURITY COMPROMISES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL

DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE

THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER

TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY

VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

PROPERTIES

OUR

PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS

IN A COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING AND BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS THE REMAINING 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS CURRENTLY INCLUDE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA;

PHOENIX, ARIZONA; AND SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, AND IN GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; A MULTI-BUILDING CAMPUS HOUSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA;

THE HEADQUARTERS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICES EUROPE LIMITED IN LONDON, ENGLAND; THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON,

ENGLAND.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS DECISION DURING 2010 TO CONSOLIDATE LOCATIONS WITHIN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL

SERVICING NETWORK, A FACILITY IN GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA, WAS CLOSED, WITH WORK PREVIOUSLY HANDLED THERE BEING TRANSFERRED TO OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. SUBJECT TO LOCAL CONSULTATIONS, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TRANSFERRING WORK

THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY HANDLED AT A MADRID, SPAIN SERVICE CENTER TO FACILITIES IN BRIGHTON, ENGLAND, BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA, FRANKFURT, GERMANY, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO, AND ROME, ITALY; AND SERVICE SUPPORT FOR THE JAPANESE CARD BUSINESS IS

BEING TRANSFERRED FROM SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA TO SAPPORO, JAPAN AND DALIAN, CHINA.

DURING 2004 AND 2005, WE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL

SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND LEASED BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS)

IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE

CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

GENERALLY, WE LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS AND ARE

WELL MAINTAINED.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS, INFORMATION GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS, INQUIRIES

AND INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY OR INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR THOSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS DISCLOSED

BELOW AS TO WHICH A LOSS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHETHER IN EXCESS OF A RELATED ACCRUED LIABILITY OR WHERE THERE IS NO ACCRUED LIABILITY, AND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS, THE CURRENT ESTIMATED

RANGE IS ZERO TO $510 MILLION IN EXCESS OF THE ACCRUED LIABILITY (IF ANY) RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. THIS AGGREGATE RANGE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS AND IS BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

INFORMATION. THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS MAXIMUM LOSS EXPOSURE. THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS UNDERLYING THE ESTIMATED RANGE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE CURRENT ESTIMATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 24 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 100-101 OF OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

CORPORATE MATTERS

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD NETWORK PRICING TO MERCHANTS AND RELATED ISSUES HAS INCREASED, THE

COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

ON OCTOBER 4,

2010, THE DOJ, ALONG WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM CONNECTICUT, IOWA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, OHIO AND TEXAS, FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE COMPANY, MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL

INCORPORATED AND VISA, INC., ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS POLICIES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM STEERING A CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD, ANOTHER

TYPE OF CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT (ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS) VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS PARTICIPATE IN TWO DISTINCT MARKETS, A

GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES MARKET AND A GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES MARKET FOR MERCHANTS IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT (T&E) BUSINESSES. THE COMPLAINT CONTENDS THAT EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS

HAS MARKET POWER IN THE ALLEGED TWO MARKETS. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING THE DEFENDANTS FROM ENFORCING THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT SEEK MONETARY

DAMAGES. CONCURRENT WITH THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, VISA AND MASTERCARD ANNOUNCED THEY HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT SETTLING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM BY AGREEING TO MODIFICATIONS IN THEIR RULES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS THAT

PRUDENT INVESTMENT; MISREPRESENTING AND FAILING TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL FACTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN; AND BREACHING CERTAIN FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. THEREAFTER, THREE OTHER PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS MAKING

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2011, THE PARTIES STIPULATED, AND THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY ORDERED, THAT THE APPEAL BE CONSIDERED WITHDRAWN BUT SUBJECT TO APPELLANTS RIGHT TO REINSTATE THEIR APPEAL BY

JANUARY 31, 2012. ON JANUARY 20, 2012, THE COURT FURTHER STAYED THROUGH MAY 2012 APPELLANTS RIGHT TO REINSTATE THEIR APPEAL.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

KAUFMAN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

, WHICH WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 14, 2007, AND IS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. THE ALLEGATIONS IN

KAUFMAN

RELATE PRIMARILY TO MONTHLY SERVICE FEE CHARGES ASSESSED ON THE COMPANYS GIFT CARD PRODUCTS, WITH THE PRINCIPAL CLAIM BEING THAT THE COMPANYS GIFT

CARDS VIOLATE CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES BECAUSE CONSUMERS ALLEGEDLY HAVE DIFFICULTY SPENDING SMALL RESIDUAL AMOUNTS ON THE GIFT CARDS PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF MONTHLY SERVICE FEES. ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 12, 2011, THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. THE COURT GRANTED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2011 AND PRELIMINARILY CERTIFIED A SETTLEMENT CLASS CONSISTING OF (WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS) ALL

PURCHASERS, RECIPIENTS AND HOLDERS OF ALL GIFT CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS FROM JANUARY 1, 2002 THROUGH THE DATE OF PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, GIFT CARDS SOLD AT PHYSICAL RETAIL LOCATIONS, VIA THE

INTERNET, OR THROUGH MALL CO-BRANDED PROGRAMS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, AN APPROXIMATE $6.8 MILLION TOTAL SETTLEMENT FUND WILL BE CREATED AND CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST THE SETTLEMENT FUND

TO RECEIVE REFUNDS OF CERTAIN GIFT CARD FEES. ANY MONIES REMAINING IN THE SETTLEMENT FUND AFTER PAYMENT OF CLAIMS TO CLASS MEMBERS, COSTS OF NOTICE AND ADMINISTRATION AND CLASS COUNSEL ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES WOULD BE PAID TO CHARITY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE SETTLEMENT CLASS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY GIFT CARDS WITHOUT PAYING A PURCHASE FEE OR ANY SHIPPING FEES AND WOULD ALLOW CERTAIN CARDHOLDERS TO OBTAIN REFUNDS OF UNUSED FUNDS ON

GIFT CARDS WITHOUT PAYING A CHECK ISSUANCE FEE. THE FINAL SETTLEMENT APPROVAL HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 29, 2012. THE COMPANY IS ALSO A DEFENDANT IN

THE FDIC AND THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN REVIEWING CENTURION BANKS CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE WAY LATE FEES ARE ASSESSED ON CHARGE CARDS WITH A LENDING FEATURE. THE FDIC HAS ALSO

PROVIDED INFORMATION IT CONSIDERED RELEVANT, INCLUDING INFORMATION OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF ITS REVIEW, TO THE CFPB. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE FDIC NOTIFIED CENTURION BANK THAT IT PLANS TO TAKE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST IT, AND IT APPEARS

LIKELY THE CFPB AND THE DFI WILL TAKE SOME TYPE OF ACTION AGAINST CENTURION BANK AS WELL. CENTURION BANK HAS MADE CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF ITS CARD PRACTICES (AND, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ESTABLISHED AN ACCRUAL FOR LATE FEES IT EXPECTS TO REFUND) AND

COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO ITS CARD PRACTICES TO RESPOND TO REGULATORY CONCERNS. CHANGES BY CENTURION BANK TO ITS CARD PRACTICES IN RESPONSE TO REGULATORY CONCERNS AND ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER ACTION BY THE FDIC, THE CFPB OR THE DFI,

WHICH MAY INCLUDE CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REFUND OBLIGATIONS TO CARDMEMBERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND RESULTS.
