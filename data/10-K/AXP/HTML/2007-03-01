</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
general purpose card network, card issuing and merchant acquiring and processing
businesses are global in scope. We are a world leader in providing charge and credit cards to
consumers, small businesses and corporations. These cards, which include cards issued by American
Express as well as cards issued by third-party banks and other institutions that are accepted on
the American Express network (collectively, &#147;Cards&#148;), are currently issued in over 40 currencies.
Our Cards permit Cardmembers to charge purchases of goods and services in most countries around
the world at the millions of merchants that accept cards bearing our logo. We added a net total of
7.0&nbsp;million Cards in 2006, bringing total worldwide Cards-in-force to 78.0&nbsp;million (including Cards
issued by third parties). In 2006, our worldwide billed business (spending on American
Express<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> </SUP> Cards, including Cards issued by third parties) was $561.5&nbsp;billion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Spend-Centric Model is Competitive Advantage</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our &#147;spend-centric&#148; business model (which focuses on generating revenues
primarily by driving spending on our Cards and secondarily by finance charges and fees) has
significant competitive advantages. Average spending per Cardmember, which is substantially higher
than for our competitors, represents greater value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and
higher sales. This gives us the ability to earn a premium discount rate and invest in greater
value-added services for merchants and Cardmembers. As a result of the higher revenues generated
from higher spending, we have the flexibility to offer more attractive rewards and other incentives
to Cardmembers, which in turn create an incentive for them to spend more on their Cards. This
business model, along with our closed loop network, in which we are both the card issuer and the
merchant acquirer, gives us a competitive advantage that we seek to leverage to provide more value
to Cardmembers, merchants and Card issuing partners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although travel
sales tend to be highest in the second quarter; Travelers Cheque sales and Travelers Cheques
outstanding tend to be greatest each year in the summer months, peaking in the third quarter, and
Card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters.

successfully in a number of countries outside the United States, where we have many banks and other
financial institutions issuing Cards on the American Express network. By leveraging our global
infrastructure and the appeal of the American Express brand, we aim to broaden our Cardmember and
merchant base for our network worldwide. Our GNS business has established more than 105 card
issuing or merchant acquiring arrangements with banks and other institutions in 120 countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key asset of our network is the American Express brand, which is one of the world&#146;s most
highly recognized and respected brands.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cards bearing our logo are issued by our principal operating subsidiary, American Express
Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (&#147;TRS&#148;), and certain of its subsidiaries and also by
third-party institutions, and are accepted at all merchant locations worldwide that accept American
Express-branded Cards. In addition, depending on the product, Cards bearing our logo are generally
accepted at ATM locations worldwide that accept Cards. TRS and its subsidiaries issue the vast
majority of Cards on our network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNS focuses on partnering with qualified third-party banks and other financial institutions
that choose to issue Cards accepted on our global network. Although we customize our network
arrangements to the particular market and our partner&#146;s requirements, as well as to our strategic
plans in that marketplace, all GNS arrangements are designed to help issuers develop products for
their highest-spending and most affluent customers and to support the value of American Express
Card acceptance to merchants. We choose to partner with institutions who share a core set of
attributes such as commitment to high quality standards, strong marketing expertise and
compatibility with the American Express brand, and we require adherence to our product, brand and
service standards.<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">*</SUP>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GNS arrangements fall into three main categories.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">






<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first type of GNS arrangement is known as an independent operator (&#147;IO&#148;) arrangement. As
of the end of 2006, we had 55 of these arrangements around the world. We pursue these arrangements
to expand the presence of the American Express network throughout the world, in markets in which we
do not offer a proprietary local currency card. Under this type of arrangement, the partner&#146;s
local presence and relationships help us enhance the impact of our brand in the market, reach
merchant coverage goals more quickly, and operate at economic scale and cost levels that would be
difficult for us to achieve on our own. We license our bank partner to issue local currency Cards
in their market, including the classic Green, Gold and Platinum American Express Cards. In
addition, the majority of these partners serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local
merchants. American Express retains the relationship with multi-national merchants. Our IO
partner owns the customer relationships and credit risk for the Cards it issues, and makes the
decisions about which customers will be issued Cards. GNS generates revenues in IO arrangements
from fees paid by the IO partner derived from the number of Cards it issues, the level of
Cardmember spending on those Cards, royalties and the total charge volume at merchants with which
the IO partner has an agreement to accept Cards. Our IO partner is responsible for transaction
authorization, billing and pricing, Cardmember servicing and funding Card receivables for its
Cards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of countries where we have entered into IO arrangements include Ecuador, Greece,
South Korea, Pakistan, Croatia, Peru, Portugal and Vietnam. In 2006, we sold our proprietary card
issuing and related businesses in Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia to Global Network Services IO
partners Banco Bradesco S.A., Maybank and Bank Danamon, respectively. Through our partnerships
with these leading financial institutions, we believe we can accelerate growth in Cardmember
spending, Cards-in-force and merchant acceptance in these countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of GNS arrangement is known as a network card license (&#147;NCL&#148;) (which we
formerly referred to as a non-proprietary license). At the end of 2006, we had 48 of these
arrangements in place. We pursue these arrangements to increase our brand presence and gain market
share in markets in which we have a proprietary Card issuing business, and in a few cases those in
which we also have IO partners. In an NCL arrangement, we grant the third-party financial
institution a license to issue American Express-branded Cards. The NCL issuer owns the customer
relationships for all Cards it issues, provides customer service to its Cardmembers, transaction
authorization, billing and credit management, and is responsible for the marketing of the Cards, and designs the Card product features
(including rewards and other incentives for Card holders), subject to
meeting certain standards. We operate the merchant network, route
and process Card transactions from the merchant&#146;s point-of-sale through submission to the issuer,
and settle with issuers. The NCL is the type of arrangement that we have implemented
with banks in the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of NCL arrangements include our relationships with Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. and
Bank of America in the United States, Lloyds TSB Bank in the United Kingdom and Westpac Banking
Corporation in Australia.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNS&#146; revenues in NCL arrangements are related to a variety of factors, including the level of
Cardmember spending, royalties and fees charged to the Card issuer based on charge volume, and our
provision of value-added services such as Cardmember insurance products and
</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">other Card features and benefits for the issuer&#146;s Cards. As indicated above, the NCL issuer
bears the credit risk for the issued Cards, as well as the Card marketing and acquisition costs,
Cardmember fraud risks and costs of rewards and other loyalty initiatives. We bear the risk
arising from the GNS partner&#146;s potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We
mitigate this risk by partnering with issuers that we believe are financially sound and will meet
their obligations, and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the terms of
their relationship with us and the political and economic environment in which they operate. In
addition, we generally require NCL issuers to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other
collateral to reduce this risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third type of GNS arrangement is a joint venture. We have utilized this type of
arrangement in Switzerland, Belgium and several other countries. In these markets, TRS joins with
a third party to establish a separate business in which TRS has a significant ownership stake. The
joint venture typically signs new merchants to the American Express network and issues local
currency Cards that carry our logo. In a joint venture arrangement, the joint venture assumes the
Cardmember credit risk and bears the operating and marketing costs. The economics of the joint
venture are similar to our proprietary Card issuing business, which we discuss below under &#147;U.S.
Card Services,&#148; and we receive a portion of the joint venture&#146;s income depending on the level of
our ownership interest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross revenues we receive per dollar spent on a Card issued by a GNS partner are lower than
those from our proprietary card issuing business. However, because the GNS partner is responsible
for most of the operating costs and risk of its card issuing business, our expenses are lower than
those in our proprietary card issuing business. The GNS business model generates an attractive
earnings stream and risk profile that requires a lower level of capital support. The return on
equity in our GNS business can thus be significantly higher than that of our proprietary card
issuing business. Because the majority of GNS costs are fixed, the GNS business is highly
scalable. GNS partners benefit from their association with the American Express brand and their
ability to gain attractive revenue streams and expand and differentiate their product offerings
with innovative marketing programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, GNS signed 11 new partners to issue Cards on the American Express network. GNS
partners launched over 125 new products during 2006, bringing the total number of American
Express-branded GNS partner products to approximately 550. Outside the United States, we have
signed a number of agreements over the past year in markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Turkey.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the situation outside the United States, where banks and other qualified
institutions have issued Cards on our network for many years, until 2004 no major U.S. banks had
issued Cards in the United States on the American Express global network. This situation was the
result of rules and policies of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association (together,
&#147;VISA&#148;) and MasterCard, Incorporated and MasterCard International, Inc. (together, &#147;MasterCard&#148;) in
the United States, which mandated expulsion of members that issued American Express-branded Cards.
No bank was willing to risk forfeiting membership in VISA and/or MasterCard (collectively, the
&#147;bankcard associations&#148;) to issue cards on our network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a consequence of the decision in a lawsuit filed in October&nbsp;1998 by the U.S.
Department of Justice against VISA and MasterCard in which such rules and policies were found to
violate the U.S. antitrust laws, these rules and policies were finally repealed in late 2004 after
the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear VISA&#146;s and MasterCard&#146;s appeal of the lower courts&#146; rulings
against them. The Supreme Court&#146;s decision not to hear the appeals marked the end of VISA&#146;s and
MasterCard&#146;s rules that prevented their member banks from issuing cards on competitive networks and
cleared the way for implementation of the trial court&#146;s order requiring the repeal of the illegal
rules. We view this decision as a major victory for U.S. consumers as well as U.S. banks because
it opened the door to more vigorous network competition and more innovative card products and
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For American Express, the conclusion of the litigation brought by the Justice Department meant
that we were now able to open our network to other card issuers in the United States, just as we
have done internationally. Building a network business in the United States that operates in
addition to our proprietary card business provides us with new and substantial opportunities for
growth. We have acted on this decision by entering into several GNS arrangements with financial
institutions in the United States, which have all launched products in the marketplace. These
companies include MBNA, Bank of America, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., HSBC Bank Nevada N.A.,
Barclays, which issues Cards to U.S. wealth management clients of UBS Financial Services Inc., and
USAA Federal Savings Bank. In addition, we have a GNS arrangement with GE Money under which GE Money Bank issues Cards
accepted on our network, the first of which is the Dillard&#146;s American Express Card.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, we filed a lawsuit against VISA, MasterCard and certain of their member
banks seeking monetary damages resulting from the illegal rules that were struck down in the U.S.
Department of Justice lawsuit discussed above. (You can read more about this lawsuit in the &#147;Legal
Proceedings&#148; section of this report below.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With approximately 550 different Card products launched on our network so far by our bank
partners, GNS is an increasingly important business that is strengthening our brand visibility
around the world, driving more transaction volume onto our merchant network and increasing the
number of merchants accepting the American Express Card. GNS enables us to expand our global
presence without having to invest large amounts of resources, as our GNS

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">partners already have established attractive customer bases they can target with American
Express-branded products. Since 1999, Cards-in-force issued by GNS partners have grown at a
compound annual growth rate of 27%, and totaled 15&nbsp;million Cards at the end of 2006. Outside the
United States, approximately 50% of new Cards issued in 2006 were Cards issued by one of our GNS
partners. Spending on these Cards has grown at a compound annual rate
of 25% since 1999, and
totaled $35.4&nbsp;billion in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in electronic transmission of credit card transaction data over merchants&#146;
point-of-sale systems, the necessity for merchants and merchant processors to secure this data
against accidental or intentional compromise using a standard protocol that applies to all card
types became clear to American Express and the other major card networks. In 2006, in order to
strengthen the security practices of merchants and payment processing firms and to secure payment
account data in a globally consistent manner, we and Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard
Worldwide and Visa International formed PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (&#147;PCI Co.&#148;), an
independent standards-setting organization to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card
Industry (PCI)&nbsp;Data Security Standard, which focuses on improving payment card account security
throughout the transaction process. By establishing PCI Co. to manage the PCI Data Security
Standard, we and the other founders have developed a common standard that is more accessible and
efficient for participants in the payment card industry. All merchants and service providers that
store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with the PCI Data Security
Standard. PCI Co. is dedicated to driving greater education, awareness and adoption of the PCI
Data Security Standard to ensure that all stakeholders involved in the payment process conduct
their business responsibly.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local regulations governing the issuance of charge and credit cards have not been a
significant factor impacting our arrangements with banks and qualifying financial institutions in
any country in which such arrangements exist, because such banks and institutions generally are
already licensed to issue general purpose cards. Accordingly, our GNS partners have generally not
had difficulty in obtaining appropriate government authorization in the markets in which we have
chosen to enter into GNS arrangements. As a network service provider to regulated U.S. banks, our
GNS business is subject to review by certain federal bank regulators, including the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift
Supervision. As the operator of a general purpose card network, we are also subject to the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;Patriot Act&#148;), which requires us to conduct due diligence on our GNS
partners to ensure that they maintain sufficient anti-money laundering and &#147;know your customer&#148;
programs to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">sale and back-office products and services and marketing programs to merchants, leveraging the
capabilities provided by our closed loop structure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
objective is for Cardmembers to be able to use the Card wherever and however they desire,
as well as to increase merchant coverage in key geographic areas and in selected new industries
that have not traditionally accepted general purpose credit and charge cards as a means of payment.
We add new merchants to our network through a number of sales channels: a proprietary sales force,
third-party sales agents, strategic alliances with banks, the Internet, telemarketing and inbound
&#147;Want to Honor&#148; calls (i.e., merchants desiring to accept the Card contacting us directly).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early 1990s, we have significantly expanded the number of merchants that accept our
Card products as well as the kinds of businesses that accept the Card. In recent years, we have
focused our efforts on increasing the use of our Cards for everyday spending. In 1990, 64% of our
U.S. billings came from the travel and entertainment sectors and 36% came from retail and other
sectors. That proportion has now been more than reversed. In 2006, U.S. non-travel and
entertainment billings represented over 65% of the U.S. billed business on American Express Cards.
This shift resulted from the growth, over time, in the types of merchants that began to accept
charge and credit cards in response to consumers&#146; increased desire to use these cards for more of
their purchases, and our focus on expanding Card acceptance to meet Cardmembers&#146; needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, we continued our efforts to encourage consumers to use the Card for everyday
spending. We increased the number and types of merchants in retail and everyday spending
categories that accept the Card, such as quick-serve restaurants, mass transit, healthcare and
recurring billing merchants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we also continued our drive of bringing Card acceptance to industries where cash
or checks are the predominant form of payment. For example, in the area of real estate, we signed
an agreement with The Moinian Group to allow down-payments for luxury condominiums to be charged on
the American Express Card. Card acceptance for private jets and residence/destination clubs, as
well as business-to-business purchases, are other examples of new industries in which the Card is
now accepted, and which have the potential to increase our average Cardmember spending.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, acceptance of general purpose charge and credit cards continues to increase,
including among merchants in industries that have not traditionally accepted charge and credit
cards. As in prior years, during 2006, we continued to grow merchant acceptance of Cards around
the world and to refine our approach to calculating merchant coverage in accordance with changes in
the marketplace. Management estimates that, as of the end of 2006, our merchant network in the
United States accommodated more than 90% of Cardmembers&#146; general purpose charge and credit card
spending, and our international merchant network as a whole accommodated approximately 80% of our
Cardmembers&#146; general purpose charge and credit card spending. These percentages are based on
comparing our Cardmembers&#146; spending on our network currently with our estimate of what our
Cardmembers would spend on our network if all merchants that accept general purpose credit and
charge cards accepted American Express Cards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We earn &#147;discount&#148; revenue from fees charged to merchants for accepting Cards as payment for
goods or services sold. The merchant discount is the fee charged to the merchant for accepting
Cards and is generally expressed as a percentage of the amount charged on a Card. The merchant
discount is generally deducted from the amount of the payment that the &#147;merchant acquirer&#148; (in most
cases, TRS or one of its subsidiaries) pays to a merchant for Charges submitted. A merchant
acquirer is the entity that contracts for Card acceptance with the merchant, accepts transactions
from the merchant, pays the merchant for these transactions and submits the transactions through
the American Express network to the appropriate Card issuer for billing to the Cardmember. When a
Cardmember presents the Card for payment, the merchant creates a record of charge for the
transaction and submits it to the merchant acquirer for payment. To the extent that TRS or one of
its subsidiaries is the merchant acquirer, the merchant discount is recorded by us as discount
revenue at the point-of-sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we act as the merchant acquirer and the Card presented at a merchant is issued by a
third-party bank or financial institution, such as in the case of our GNS partners, we will make
financial settlement to the merchant and receive the discount revenue. In our role as the operator
of the Card network, we will also receive financial settlement from the Card issuer, who retains an
issuer rate (i.e., the individually negotiated amount that Card issuers receive for transactions
charged on our network with Cards that they issue, which is usually expressed as a percentage of
the charged amount). The difference between the discount revenue (received by us in the form of
the merchant discount) and the issuer rate received by the Card issuer generates a return to us.
Where we are the Card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third-party bank or financial
institution (which can be the case in a country in which the IO is the local merchant acquirer), we
receive an issuer rate in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is recorded by us as
discount revenue.

expertise, and Cardmembers&#146; insistence on using their Cards when enrolled in rewards or other Card
loyalty programs, including those as part of our Corporate Card program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant discount rate varies with the industry in which the merchant does business, the
Charge volume, the timing and method of payment to the merchant, the method of submission of
Charges and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the Card acceptance agreement signed
with us (local or global) and the Charge amount. In 2006, as in prior
years, we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate,
principally reflecting the impact of selective repricing initiatives, continued changes in the mix
of business and volume-related pricing adjustments. We expect that the effect of these factors will
likely continue to result in some erosion over time of the weighted average merchant discount rate,
particularly outside the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most merchants understand our merchant discount rate pricing in relation to the value
provided, we do encounter a relatively small number of merchants that accept our Cards, but tell
their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment and, consequently, suppress use
of the Card. We respond to this issue aggressively to ensure that our Cardmembers are able to use
their Card where and when they want to. We have made progress by: concentrating on acquiring
merchants where Cardmembers want to use the Card; continuing to enhance the value we provide by
programs such as American Express Selects<SUP>&#174;</SUP> and My WishList, which enable
merchants to gain valuable exposure and additional sales by providing exclusive offers and
experiences to American Express Cardmembers; providing better and earlier communication of our
value proposition; and, when necessary, cancelling merchants who suppress the use of our Card
products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of My WishList, a seasonal Web site we developed in conjunction with merchant
partners, we are able to greatly enhance our merchant value. Through the site, we provide
Cardmembers with opportunities to buy a limited number of sought-after items, such as automobiles,
trips, electronics and jewelry, at a fraction of their retail prices, as well as access to numerous
offers from top brands. Through American Express Selects, we make available to our Cardmembers
high quality shopping, dining and travel values from merchants all over the world, and these
merchants have an opportunity to reach out to our Cardmembers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchant satisfaction is a key goal of our Global Merchant Services business. We focus on
understanding and addressing factors that influence merchant satisfaction, including developing and
executing innovative programs that increase Card usage at merchants, using technology resources,
our closed loop and deep marketing expertise and strengthening our relationships with merchants
through an expanding roster of services that help them meet their business goals. We offer a full
range of point-of-sale solutions, including integrated point-of-sale terminals and direct links
that allow merchants to accept American Express Cards, as well as bankcards, debit cards and
checks, and contactless point-of-sale terminals that enable merchants to accept contactless payment
products including our ExpressPay from American Express<SUP>&#174;</SUP> products. Virtually all proprietary point-of-sale solutions
support direct processing (i.e., direct connectivity) to American Express, which lowers a
merchant&#146;s cost of Card acceptance and avoids payment delays caused by a third party.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExpressPay,
a contactless payment feature, is designed to be a fast, easy-to-use
alternative for making everyday purchases at merchants where speed
and convenience is important. ExpressPay is now accepted at over 30,000 places in the United States,
including top quick-service restaurant, movie theater, drug store and convenience store chains.
ExpressPay, powered by radio-frequency technology, is available both in a key-fob form and has been
introduced within several Card products. In 2006, we expanded merchant coverage of ExpressPay by
partnering with organizations like the Utah Transit Authority, Jack in the Box, and Arby&#146;s
Restaurant Group, Inc. at participating locations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to focus our efforts on the fast-growing recurring billing industry through
Automatic Bill Payment, a service that allows merchants to bill Cardmembers on a regular basis for
recurring charges such as insurance premiums, newspaper subscriptions, health club memberships,
commutation costs and cable television service. We have also made modifications to our host authorization
system to approve more transactions and reduce Cardmember inconvenience at the point-of-sale
without a corresponding increase in fraud or credit losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever we manage both the acquiring relationship with merchants and the Card issuing side of
the business, there is a &#147;closed loop,&#148; which distinguishes our network from the bankcard networks
in that there is access to information at both ends of the Card transaction. We maintain a direct
relationship with both our Cardmembers and our merchants, and we handle all key aspects of those
relationships. Our relationships allow us to analyze information on Cardmembers&#146; spend. This
enables us to provide targeted marketing for merchants and special offers to Cardmembers through a
variety of channels, subject to compliance with our privacy policy and legal requirements. We
protect the confidentiality of this data, and comply with strict privacy, firewall and applicable
legal requirements. We work closely with our Card issuing bank partners to maintain key elements of this closed
loop, which permits them to customize marketing efforts, deliver greater value to their Cardmembers
and help us to direct increased business to merchants who accept the Card.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the merchant acquirer, we have certain contingent liabilities that arise if a billing
dispute between a Cardmember and a merchant is settled in favor of the Cardmember. Drivers of this
liability are returns in the normal course of business, disputes over fraudulent charges, the
quality or non-delivery of goods and services and billing errors. Typically, we offset the amount
due to the Cardmember against payments for the merchant&#146;s current or future Charge submissions. We
can realize losses when offsetting submissions cease, such as when the merchant commences a
bankruptcy proceeding or goes out of business. We actively monitor our merchant base to assess the
risk of this exposure. When appropriate, we will take action to reduce the net exposure to a given
merchant by requiring a parent company guarantee or letter of credit, holding cash reserves funded
through Charge payable holdbacks from a merchant, lengthening the time between when the merchant
submits a Charge for payment and when we pay the merchant or implementing other appropriate risk
management tools. We also establish reserves on our balance sheet for these contingencies.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some markets outside the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom, third-party
processors and some bankcard acquirers have begun to offer merchants the capability of converting
credit card transactions from the local currency to the currency of the cardholder&#146;s residence
(i.e., the cardholder&#146;s billing currency) at the point-of-sale, and submitting the transaction in
the cardholder&#146;s billing currency, thus bypassing the traditional foreign currency conversion
process of the card network. This practice is known as &#147;dynamic currency conversion.&#148; If a
merchant utilizes a dynamic currency conversion process, the merchant and processor share any fee
assessed or spread earned for converting the transaction at the point of sale, thus reducing or
eliminating revenue for card issuers and card networks relating to the conversion of foreign
charges to the cardholder&#146;s billing currency. This practice is not widespread, and it is uncertain
to what extent consumers will prefer to have foreign currency transactions converted by merchants
in this way. Our policy generally requires merchants to submit Charges and be paid in the currency
of the country in which the transaction occurs, and we convert the transaction to the Cardmember&#146;s
billing currency.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our network competes with other charge and credit card networks, including, among others,
VISA, MasterCard, Diners Club (which, in the United States and Canada, has been folded into the
network operated by MasterCard), Discover, a business unit of Morgan Stanley (primarily in the
United States), and JCB Co., Ltd. (primarily in Asia). We are the third largest general purpose
charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind VISA and MasterCard, which are larger
than we are in most markets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our competitors have attempted to replicate our closed loop structure, such as VISA&#146;s
Visa Incentive Network. Although it remains to be seen how effective VISA will be, efforts by VISA
and other card networks and payment providers to replicate the closed loop speak both to its
continued value, as well as the intense competitive environment in which we operate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Regulation</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, regulators in several countries have focused on the fees involved in the
operation of card networks, including the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators
in the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Spain, the European Union, Australia, Mexico and
Switzerland, among others, have conducted, and are continuing to conduct, investigations into the
way bankcard network members collectively set the &#147;interchange,&#148; which is the fee paid by the
bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank. The interchange fee is generally the largest
component of the merchant discount rate charged to merchants by the merchant acquirer for bankcard
debit and credit charges. Although the regulators&#146; focus has primarily been on VISA and MasterCard
as the dominant card networks, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard
associations&#146; pricing could ultimately affect all networks. Downward movement of interchange and
merchant discount fees may affect the relative economic attractiveness to card issuers and merchant
acquirers of participation in a particular network. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount
revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as annual card fees, as
well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs. In certain countries
where antitrust actions or regulations have forced our competitors to lower their fees, we have
made adjustments to our own fee arrangements with merchants to reflect local competitive trends.
For example, reductions in bankcard interchange mandated by the Reserve Bank of Australia reforms
in 2003 have resulted in lower merchant discount rates for VISA and MasterCard. As a result of
changes in the marketplace, we have reduced our own merchant discount rates in Australia although
we have nevertheless been able to increase billed business and the number of merchants accepting
our Cards. In addition, under legislation enacted in Argentina, a merchant acquirer is required to
charge the same merchant discount rate to all merchants in the same industry category, and merchant
discount rates cannot exceed 3%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Final Report on the retail banking sector issued in January&nbsp;2007, which included review
of the payment cards industry, including interchange fees, the European Commission appears to favor
competition law enforcement tools, rather than regulating price levels, as the preferred means to
address perceived issues of insufficient competition in the European payment cards industry. The conclusions
of the European Commission as expressed in its Final Report do not have the force of law, but may
be used as the basis for future legislation or regulation in the European Union countries. In
2007, as an example, the competition regulator in Poland found insufficient basis for VISA and
MasterCard interchange fees and ordered the associations to stop their current interchange setting
practices, and the banks are appealing that decision.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and various Federal
Reserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences
focused on credit card interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in
monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United
States. In Congress, there have been several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last
year. During 2006, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual state legislatures
seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange or to prohibit card companies from charging
merchant discount on the state tax portion of credit card purchases. None of those bills was
enacted. It is expected that Congressional hearings and similar proposed state legislation will
continue during 2007. In the event that governmental or regulatory activity to limit interchange
continues or increases, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulators, including most recently the European Commission, have considered the industry
practice of prohibiting merchants from passing the cost of merchant discount fees along to
consumers through surcharges on card purchases. Although some countries, such as the United
Kingdom, have for a number of years permitted merchants to levy a surcharge on credit card
purchases, provided that surcharges were clearly disclosed, there has to date been a relatively low
overall incidence of surcharging, as merchants do not want to risk offending customers or losing
them to competitors that do not assess surcharges for credit card purchases. In its Final Report,
the European Commission indicated that prohibiting surcharging appeared to restrict inter-network
competition and may constitute a barrier to entry for alternative, non-cash payment instruments.
In Australia, we have seen selective merchant surcharging in certain industries such as
telecommunications and, in some cases, on a basis that is greater than applied to the bankcard
networks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Commission will likely be enacting a new legislative directive that will put in
place a licensing and supervision framework for all electronic payment methods in the European
Union over the course of the next several years. The objective is to create a single, internal
payments market throughout the European Union. The directive will likely be finalized in 2007 and
adopted as legislation in the member states of the European Union through to the end of 2008. By
2010, licensing will be required and supervision will commence for American Express&#146; card operations
in the European Union. One provision of this draft directive gives merchants the right to
surcharge, subject to disclosure requirements. At the same time, new technical standards are being
adopted by the industry. All of the foregoing will entail costs to implement and maintain.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Charge Cards</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our charge Cards, which carry no pre-set spending limits, are primarily designed as a method
of payment and not as a means of financing purchases of goods or services. Charges are approved
based on a variety of factors including a Cardmember&#146;s current spending patterns, payment history,
credit record, and financial resources. Cardmembers generally must pay the full amount billed each
month, and no finance charges are assessed on the balance. Charge Card accounts that are past due
are subject, in most cases, to a delinquency assessment and, if not brought to current status, may
be cancelled. The no preset-spending limit and pay-in-full nature of these products attract
high-spending Cardmembers who want to use a charge Card to facilitate larger payments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge Cards also offer enrollment services to Cardmembers. The Sign &#038;
Travel<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> </SUP> program gives qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of extended
payments for airline, cruise and certain travel charges that are purchased with our charge Cards.
The Extended Payment Option offers qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of extending payment for
certain charges on the charge Card in excess of a specified amount.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer a variety of revolving credit Cards. These Cards have a range of different payment

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">top tier of card issuers. Much of this growth has been due to the breadth of our lending
products, such as Blue from American Express, Blue Cash from American Express
and the Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express, as well as the increased number of charge
Cardmembers who have taken advantage of our &#147;lending on charge&#148; options (such as the Sign &#038; Travel

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Cobrand Cards</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We issue Cards under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms in the United States.
The competition among card issuers and networks for attractive cobrand card partnerships is quite
intense because they can generate high-spending loyal cardholders. The duration of our cobrand
arrangements generally ranges from five to ten years. Cardmembers earn rewards provided by the
partners&#146; respective loyalty programs based upon their spending on the cobrand Cards, such as
frequent flyer miles, hotel loyalty points and cash back. We make payments to our cobrand
partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Cardmember spending and
corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of
accounts acquired and retained. We expense amounts due under cobrand arrangements in the month
earned. Payment terms vary by arrangement, but are monthly or quarterly. Generally, once we make
payment to the cobrand partner, the partner is solely liable for providing
rewards to the Cardmember under the cobrand partner&#146;s own loyalty program. As the issuer of the
cobrand card, we retain all the credit risk with the Cardmember and bear the receivables funding
and operating expenses for such cards. The cobrand partner retains the risk associated with the
miles, points or other currency earned by the Cardmember under the partner&#146;s loyalty program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U>Cobrand Partnerships with Financial Services Institutions</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also issue Cards that are marketed under cobrand partnership arrangements with financial
services partners. Such partnerships involve the offering of a standard product (issued by TRS or
one of its subsidiaries) to customers of the financial services partner, generally cobranded with
the partner&#146;s name on the Card. Under these arrangements, we make payments to the financial
services partners that are primarily based on the number of accounts acquired and retained through
the arrangement and the amount of Cardmember spending on such Cards. The duration of such
arrangements generally ranges from three to seven years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, during 2005 we established an alliance with Guaranty Bank to distribute cobranded
cards to Guaranty&#146;s small business customers throughout its branch network in Texas and California.
In 2006, we expanded this partnership to include a cobranded American Express Preferred Rewards
Gold Card, to be offered to Guaranty Bank&#146;s consumer customers at its various locations. This past
year, we also announced a strategic bank partnership between OPEN from American Express and
Sovereign Bank, under which Sovereign will offer American Express Business Cards to small business
customers in the Northeast.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revolving credit Cards in the United States are issued by American Express Centurion Bank
(&#147;Centurion Bank&#148;), which markets primarily through direct mail and other remote marketing
channels, and American Express Bank, FSB (&#147;AEBFSB&#148;), which markets primarily through in-person
selling and third-party cobrand partners. Both banks are wholly owned subsidiaries of TRS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centurion Bank is a Utah-chartered industrial bank regulated, supervised and regularly
examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). Centurion Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution. AEBFSB is a
federal savings bank regulated, supervised and regularly examined by the Office of Thrift
Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. AEBFSB is an FDIC-insured
depository institution. The activities of Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to examination by
their respective regulators. Both banks take steps to maintain compliance programs to
address the various safety and soundness, internal control and compliance requirements, including anti-money laundering
requirements, that apply to them. You can find a further discussion of the anti-money laundering
initiatives affecting us under &#147;Corporate and Other&#148; below.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centurion Bank is subject to the risk-based capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the
FDIC. Under these regulations, a bank is deemed to be well-capitalized if it maintains a tier one
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a
leverage ratio of at least 5%. Based on Centurion Bank&#146;s tier one risk-based capital, total
risk-based capital and leverage ratios, Centurion Bank was considered
to be well-capitalized at

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEBFSB is subject to the risk-based capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the OTS.
Under these regulations, a federal savings bank is deemed to be well-capitalized if it maintains a

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our Cards, particularly charge Cards, charge an annual fee that varies based on the
type of Card and the number of Cards for each account. We also offer many revolving credit Cards
with no annual fee but on which we assess finance charges for revolving balances. Depending on the
product, we also charge Cardmember fees to participate in rewards programs, for account performance
(e.g., late fees) or for certain services (e.g., additional copies of account statements). We
apply standards and criteria for creditworthiness to each Cardmember through a variety of means
both at the time of initial solicitation or application and on an ongoing basis during the Card
relationship. We use sophisticated credit models and techniques in our risk management operations
and believe that our strong risk management capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Membership Rewards program from American Express has over 1,300 redemption partners
worldwide and is offered in 98 markets. The program allows Cardmembers to earn one point for
virtually every dollar charged on eligible, enrolled American Express <SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>  Cards,
and then redeem their points for a wide array of rewards, including travel, retail merchandise,
dining and entertainment, financial services and even donating their points to benefit tens of
thousands of charities. Points have no expiration date, and there is no limit on the number of
points one can earn.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2006, we introduced innovative features such as <I>First
Collection</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">SM</SUP>
portfolio, a luxury rewards tier
exclusively for Platinum
Card<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
and Centurion<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Card members. Redemption partners include some of the world&#146;s
finest retail establishments and service providers, such as Tiffany &#038; Co., Lamborghini and Oberoi
Hotels &#038; Resorts. We also introduced <I>Bonus Points
Mall</I><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">SM</SUP>
program, an online gateway to more than 100
retailers, where Cardmembers can earn double Membership Rewards points for their purchases. We
also redesigned our Web site to deliver enhanced capabilities. In 2007, we plan to introduce a
tiered structure that will include tailored rewards offerings and
services for our premium Cards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Cardmember enrolled in the Membership Rewards program uses the Card, we establish
reserves to cover the cost of estimated future reward redemptions for points earned to date. When
a Membership Rewards program enrollee redeems a reward using Membership Rewards points, we make a
payment to the Membership Rewards program partner providing the reward pursuant to contractual
arrangements. Because of higher charge volumes and increased customer participation in Membership
Rewards, the expense of the program has increased both in the United States and internationally
over the past several years and continues to grow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the increasing costs of the Membership Rewards program as penetration and usage
expand, it plays a vital role in our profitability. The program continues to be an important
driver of Cardmember spending and loyalty. We believe, based on historical experience, that
Cardmembers enrolled in rewards programs yield higher spend, stronger credit performance and
greater profit for us. For the three-year period through the end of 2006, total spending by U.S.
Membership Rewards participants increased by 66%. By offering a broader range of redemption
choices, we have given our Cardmembers more flexibility in the use of their rewards points and
favorably affected our average cost per point. We continually seek to optimize the overall
economics of the program and make changes to enhance its value to Cardmembers. Our program is also
valuable to merchants that become redemption partners as we bring them high-spending Cardmembers
and new marketing channels to reach these Cardmembers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proprietary Card business encounters substantial and intense competition. As a card
issuer, we compete in the United States with financial institutions (such as Citibank, Bank of
America, JPMorgan Chase, and Capital One Financial) that issue general purpose credit cards,
primarily under revolving credit plans, and the Morgan Stanley affiliate that issues the Discover
Card on the Discover Business Services network. We also encounter limited competition from
businesses that issue their own cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers, such as
retailers and airline associations, although these cards are not generally substitutes for our
Cards because of their limited acceptance. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and
financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there
are now a smaller number of significant issuers and the largest issuers have continued to grow, in
several cases by acquiring card portfolios and also by cross-selling through their retail branch
networks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competing card issuers offer a variety of products and services to attract cardholders,
including premium cards with enhanced services or lines of credit, airline frequent flyer program
mileage credits, cash rebates and other reward or rebate programs, services for small business
owners, &#147;teaser&#148; promotional interest rates for both credit card acquisition and balance transfers,
and cobranded arrangements with partners that offer benefits to cardholders. In recent years we
have encountered increasingly intense competition in the small business sector, as competitors

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most financial institutions that offer demand deposit accounts also issue debit cards to
permit depositors to access their funds. Use of debit cards for point-of-sale purchases has grown
as most financial institutions have replaced ATM cards with general purpose debit cards bearing
either the VISA or MasterCard logo. As a result, the volume of transactions made with debit cards
in the United States has continued to increase significantly and, in the United States, has grown
more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions. Debit cards are marketed as replacements
for cash and checks, and transactions made with debit cards are typically for small dollar amounts.
The ability to substitute debit cards for credit and charge cards is limited because the consumer
must have sufficient funds in his or her demand deposit account to cover the transaction in
question. For example, larger purchases or delayed purchases may not be appropriate for debit
cards. We do not currently issue point-of-sale debit cards for use on the American Express
network.

interagency body composed of the principal U.S. federal entities that regulate banks and other
financial institutions, issued new guidance to the industry on credit card account management and
loss allowance practices (the &#147;Guidance&#148;). The Guidance covers five areas: (i)&nbsp;credit line
management, (ii)&nbsp;over-limit practices, (iii)&nbsp;minimum payment and negative amortization practices,
(iv)&nbsp;workout and forbearance practices, and (v)&nbsp;certain income (fee)&nbsp;recognition and loss allowance
practices. The Guidance is generally applicable to all institutions under the supervision of the
federal bank regulatory agencies that comprise the FFIEC, although it is primarily the result of
the identification by bank regulators in their examinations of other credit card lenders&#146; practices
deemed by them to be inappropriate, particularly, but not exclusively, with regard to subprime
lending programs. At present, we do not have any lending programs
that target the subprime market. Centurion Bank and

impact on our businesses or practices.

foreign currency, checks, other brands of travelers checks, and, increasingly, debit and ATM cards,
as well as credit and charge cards (even though travelers checks and prepaid cards are not
substitutes for charge and credit cards) and, to a limited extent, competing prepaid cards. The

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an issuer of travelers checks, we are regulated in the United States under the &#147;money
transmitter&#148; or &#147;sale of check&#148; laws in effect in most states. These laws require travelers check
(and, where applicable, prepaid card) issuers to obtain licenses, to meet certain safety and
soundness criteria, to hold outstanding proceeds of sale in highly-rated and secure investments,
and to provide detailed reports. We invest the proceeds from sales of our Travelers Cheques and
prepaid cards issued by TRS in accordance with applicable law,
predominantly in highly-rated debt
securities consisting primarily of intermediate- and long-term federal, state and municipal
obligations. In 2006, a few states (e.g., Hawaii and New Hampshire) passed money transmitter laws
for the first time, and we have applied for or secured licenses in each of these jurisdictions.
Many states examine licensees annually. In addition, travelers check issuers are required by the
laws of many states to comply with state unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which such
issuers must pay to states the face amount of any travelers check that is uncashed or unredeemed
after 15&nbsp;years. A few states have amended their abandoned property laws to apply to prepaid cards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, some states have enacted laws pertaining to the issuance and the sale
of gift cards. We continue to monitor state legislative activity restricting the fees that
consumers can be charged or the expiration dates that can apply to gift cards. In certain states
where regulation has made it impossible for us to offer gift cards profitably, we have limited or
withdrawn from selling these cards. Federal anti-money laundering regulations require, among other
things, the registration of traveler check issuers as &#147;Money Service Businesses&#148; and compliance
with anti-money laundering recordkeeping and reporting requirements by issuers and selling outlets.
At this time, stored value issuers and redeemers, while considered to be &#147;Money Service
Businesses,&#148; are not required to register under these regulations. Outside the United States, there are varying licensing
and anti-money laundering requirements, including some that are similar to those in the United
States.

partners are in the travel industry. Cardmembers can redeem their points with more than 35
airlines and over 200 hotels. Our redemption options include travel, retail merchandise,
entertainment, shopping and recreation gift certificates, experiences, financial services and
charity rewards. In 2006, we continued to enhance our rewards programs in several markets,
offering more flexible choices that enable Cardmembers to redeem points more quickly.
Significantly, in selected markets we launched TravelKey, which allows Cardmembers to book flights

percentage of their total payments, with some large emerging market countries just beginning to
transition to card usage in any meaningful way. Currently, we have a small share of consumer card
spending outside the United States. Internationally, our proprietary Card issuing business is

continuing to expand its business with midsize companies, which represent significant growth opportunities. Businesses of this size often do not have corporate card
programs. However, once enrolled in the program, midsize companies, which usually do not have
well-defined purchasing programs, will typically put a significant portion of their business
spending (both travel and entertainment and non-T&#038;E, such as office supplies) on the Card because
they can gain control, savings and employee benefits. In 2005, our GCS business invested in a wide
range of marketing programs and product enhancements, and added sales staff to build our business
within the midsize segment. In support of this strategy, GCS offers the Savings at

help them gain visibility into their spending patterns, as well as the ability make changes to
their program or Card accounts through an easy to use online interface. @ Work also includes
automated expense reporting and reconciliation tools that enable clients to enforce program
compliance and effectively integrate spend information with their internal accounting systems.
This suite of online tools is intended to assist companies in managing expenses more efficiently

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
commercial payments industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with
competition increasingly intense at both the card network and card
issuer levels. At the network level, we have experienced increasing
competition in the commercial card marketplace, including aggressive expansion into new and emerging markets,
efforts to transition business-to-business spend from cash and check to cards and electronic
invoicing and payment vehicles and expanding marketing and advertising budgets for commercial
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, both VISA and MasterCard have increased efforts to support card issuers such as
U.S. Bank, JPMorgan Chase, GE Capital Financial Inc. and Citibank (in the United States and
globally), who are willing to build and support data collection and reporting necessary to satisfy
customer requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card issuers have increasingly acquired niche technology offerings to enhance data capture
capabilities and reporting functionality. These efforts are built on the solid progress of the
bankcard associations to offer more global, robust solutions. As such, global servicing, data
quality, technological functionality and simplicity, and customer experience are among the key
competitive factors in the commercial card business.

proprietary operations and six are managed through joint ventures. In addition, Business Travel
also serves customers in other relevant markets through franchise partnerships. In 2006, Business
Travel sold and franchised operations in Brazil and New Zealand. American Express processed $21.8

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Travel continues to update its economic model and invest in new innovative products,
services and technologies to enhance the value that we deliver to our customers and address ongoing
travel industry challenges and opportunities. For example, we have substantially reduced our
reliance on commission revenues from suppliers (such as airlines or hotels), and now generate
revenues primarily from customers who pay for the services that we provide. We have comprehensive
cost-saving travel management offerings for our clients, including webfare guarantees for the
small- and mid-sized segments in the United States, a travel management loyalty program with double
Membership Rewards points for individual travelers and automatic ticket refunds in the United
States and select international markets. We also offer customers savings and benefits through the
Preferred Extra supplier value programs and advisory services, which provide consulting solutions
in all areas of travel and entertainment expense management. Business Travel also offers the
TravelBahn <SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> </SUP> Distribution Solution, a proprietary distribution solution that
provides access to airline inventory and fares for American Express Business Travel customers with
a number of carriers, in North America and in select international markets. Business Travel offers
a range of other solutions to our customers that provide them with savings, control, services and
traveler care.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other developments during 2006, we also worked with Rearden Commerce to launch American
Express Intelligent Online Marketplace (AXIOM<sup>SM</sup>), an online marketplace of more than 135,000
suppliers that lets clients find, purchase and manage both traditional travel and related services,
such as airport parking, dining and package shipping. This site passes on negotiated savings from
our merchant partners to clients, and makes it easier for business travelers to book with approved
suppliers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Travel continued numerous reengineering initiatives in 2006, including the
rationalization of our network, standardization of platforms and processes and implementation of
new technology solutions to increase the flexibility of our business model, increase productivity,
reduce costs and enhance the quality of customer service globally. Business Travel has also moved
many of its business processes and customer servicing online. In the United States, 43% of all of
GCS&#146; business travel transactions were processed online, and while lower than in the United States,
online penetration rates in other markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico and
Australia have been increasing in recent years, ranging from 7% to 27%.

travel and FES standalone city locations, with the exceptions of Australia, Mexico and Italy. We
are concentrating the retail foreign exchange business in key international airports, including
London&#146;s Heathrow, the Aeroports de Paris and Changi Airport in Singapore. For corporate clients,
our International Payments online payment product allows companies and banks to make cross-border
payments in major foreign currencies at competitive exchange rates. Wholesale banknote services

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Travel continues to face intense competition in the United States and internationally
from numerous traditional and online travel management companies, as well as from direct sales by
airlines and other travel suppliers. Competition among travel management companies is mainly based
on price, service, value creation, convenience, global capabilities and proximity to the customer.
In addition, competition comes from corporate customers themselves, as some companies have become
accredited as in-house corporate travel agents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, significant changes were announced to the ownership and network structure of four of
the major traditional travel management companies &#150; Business Travel International, TQ3, Carlson
Wagonlit and Navigant International, Inc. &#150; consolidating and realigning the shape of the industry.
Similarly, changes to the ownership structures of numerous other travel industry companies were
announced in 2006, including, but not limited to, Qantas Airways Ltd., Sabre Holdings Corporation,
Travelport Ltd. and Worldspan LP. In addition, the recently-withdrawn offer by US Airways to
acquire Delta Air Lines has increased speculation that the U.S. airline industry may be entering a
period of consolidation. More change in the industry is expected to follow. Each of these changes
to the competitive environment in the industry may result in additional challenges to travel
management companies, which could have a competitive impact.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
many years, travel management companies have faced pressure on
revenues from airlines, as most
carriers have stopped paying &#147;base&#148; commissions to travel agents for tickets sold. Carriers have
also increased the number of transactions they book directly through their Web sites and

not receive distribution revenue from directly booked transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, intense competition among travel management companies, the ongoing trends of airline
direct sales, rise of low-cost carriers and ongoing reductions in or elimination of airline
commissions and fees continue to put pressure on revenue for travel agents. We believe that the
restructuring of our business model over the last few years by charging customers for the services
we provide and the value we create, restructuring our expense base through the rationalization of
our call center locations, transitioning many of our services online, and our global presence have
helped us to balance these revenue pressures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Express Bank (&#147;AEB&#148;) serves affluent and high net worth individuals and financial
institutions through over 75 locations in 47 countries and regions worldwide. AEB&#146;s operations are
conducted primarily through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd., and
its subsidiaries. AEB serves financial institutions worldwide and individual clients outside the
United States. AEB does not directly or indirectly do business in the United States except as may
be incidental to its activities outside the United States. The following discussion relating to
AEB generally does not distinguish between U.S.- and non-U.S.-based activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEB&#146;s two primary business lines are Global Wealth Management (&#147;GWM&#148;), which incorporates The
Private Bank and Financial Advisory Services, and the Financial Institutions Group (&#147;FIG&#148;). The
Private Bank focuses on delivering an extensive range of investment management, trust and estate
planning and banking services, including secured lending and investment certificates, to high net
worth individuals. Financial Advisory Services provides a wide variety of local, domestic saving
and investment products to affluent individuals in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Mexico, Indonesia,
the Philippines and Germany.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIG provides financial institution clients with a wide range of correspondent banking
products, including international payments processing (wire transfers and checks), trade-related
payments and financing, cash management, loans, extensions of credit and investment products. AEB
also distributes mutual funds through its financial institutions clients. In addition, AEB
provides treasury and capital market products and services to its customers, including foreign
exchange, foreign exchange options and other derivatives and interest rate risk management
products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEB continues to work with other parts of American Express to cross-sell a range of payment,
lending and financial service products and build deeper relationships with consumer and small
business customers in key international markets. AEB markets its Private Bank services to a highly
selective group of Cardmembers outside the United States. AEB offers credit products such as
installment loans and revolving lines of credit to both Cardmembers and non-Cardmembers in Germany,
Hong Kong, India and Singapore. AEB also issues deposit certificates denominated in U.S. dollars,
euros, pounds sterling and Australian dollars through American Express International Deposit
Company in the Cayman Islands.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEB&#146;s worldwide headquarters is located in New York City. It maintains an international
banking agency in New York City and Miami, Florida, and facility offices in San Francisco, San
Diego and Los Angeles, California, as well as a representative office in Atlanta, Georgia. Its

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global nature of AEB&#146;s business activities is such that concentrations of credit to
geographic regions are not unusual. AEB continually monitors and actively manages its credit
concentrations to reduce the associated risk. The Private Bank&#146;s loans are generally secured by
liquid, marketable collateral. FIG controls its exposures by limiting its relationships to select
banks and limiting its exposures to such banks to quantitative limits (by obligor, by country and
by exposure type) that are periodically re-evaluated; such exposures also typically carry a
short-term tenure and are trade-related, which generally has a lower risk profile. At December&nbsp;31,
2006, AEB had significant investments in certain on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments,
which were primarily represented by deposits with banks, securities, loans, forward contracts,
contractual amounts of letters of credit (standby and commercial) and guarantees. The
counterparties to these financial instruments were primarily unrelated to AEB, and principally
consisted of consumers to whom AEB has extended loans, banks and other financial institutions and
foreign government agencies operating geographically within the Asia/Pacific region, Europe, North
America, Latin America, the Indian Subcontinent and Middle East/Africa.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEB&#146;s earnings are sensitive to interest rates because the repricing of its liabilities does
not, generally, match the repricing of its assets. AEB invests deposits in excess of loans and the
proceeds of investment certificates in highly-rated investment securities. It maintains mandatory
investment portfolios in a number of countries as required by central banks. AEB monitors and
controls its assets-liability mismatches both on a country and global level through a rigorous
Earnings at Risk process and manages the mismatch of assets and liabilities by adjusting the
repricing frequency of its investments or by using derivatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEB sells foreign exchange, interest rate and equity products to its customer base and may
decide to take short-term proprietary trading positions as a result of this business. The foreign
exchange, interest rate and equity risk is managed at the branch and global level through a
comprehensive Value at Risk process. AEB manages counterparty credit exposure on foreign exchange
and interest rate derivatives through a dynamic mark-to-market and potential future exposure
process, in which the current fair value and potential future exposure are calculated and managed
against counterparty loan equivalent limits. You can find more information on AEB&#146;s management of
its foreign exchange risk and use of derivative financial instruments

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Express Banking Corp. (&#147;AEBC&#148;) is a New York investment company organized under
Article&nbsp;XII of the New York Banking Law and is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of American
Express. American Express Bank Ltd. (&#147;AEBL&#148;) is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of AEBC. AEBC,
AEBL and AEBL&#146;s global network of offices and subsidiaries are subject to continuous supervision
and examination by the New York State Banking Department (&#147;NYSBD&#148;) pursuant to the New York Banking
Law. AEBC does not directly engage in banking activities. AEBL&#146;s branches, representative offices
and subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in the jurisdictions in which they do business and are
subject to the same local requirements as other competitors that have the same license.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since AEBC and AEBL do not do business in the United States, except as may be incidental to
their activities outside the United States, our affiliation with AEBC and AEBL does not require us
to register as a bank holding company under Regulation&nbsp;Y promulgated by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;). AEBC and AEBL are not members of the Federal
Reserve System, are not subject to supervision by the FDIC, and are not subject to any of the
restrictions imposed by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987
other than anti-tying rules
with respect to transactions involving products and services of certain of its affiliates. AEBC
and AEBL are not financial holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NYSBD requires AEBC, on a consolidated basis, to monitor its financial condition and
maintain risk-based and leverage capital in accordance with minimum thresholds established by the
NYSBD. At year-end 2006, AEB had Tier One, Total and Leverage capital (as those terms are defined
under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines) that exceeded the minimum
standards established by the NYSBD. Additionally, AEB is not required to comply on a consolidated
basis with the Advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach incorporated in the Basel II Capital Accord
Framework published in June, 2004. AEB monitors developments with respect to the implementation of
the Basel II Capital Accord in jurisdictions where its branch and subsidiary network is located.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most aspects of our business are subject to rigorous regulation by U.S. Federal and state
regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory
bodies and securities exchanges. Certain of our public disclosure, internal control environment
and corporate governance principles are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related
regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. New laws or regulations or
changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) could
materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. As a global
financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or
inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs
in our compliance efforts.

products and services. Our customers are given choices about how we use and disclose their
information, and we give them notice regarding the measures we take to safeguard this information.
Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data protection continues to increase worldwide,
spurred by advancements in technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread
dissemination and use of information. As noted above, as part of our efforts to enhance payment
account data security, in 2006, we and Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide and
Visa International formed the PCI Security Standards Council, an open global forum for the ongoing

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#147;GLBA&#148;) became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2001. GLBA provides for
disclosure of a financial institution&#146;s privacy policies and practices and affords customers the
right to &#147;opt out&#148; of the institution&#146;s disclosure of their personal financial information to
unaffiliated third parties (with limited exceptions). This legislation does not preempt state laws
that afford greater privacy protections to consumers, and several states have adopted such
legislation. For example, in 2003 California enacted that state&#146;s Financial Information Privacy
Act. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with
applicable law and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the
potential for identity theft, while seeking to collect and use data properly to achieve our
business objectives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by
consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer credit report information by banks and other
companies. FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in December&nbsp;2003 of the Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the &#147;FACT Act&#148;). The FACT Act requires any company that receives
information concerning a consumer from an affiliate to permit the consumer to opt out from having
that information used to market the company&#146;s products to the consumer. The FACT Act further
amends the FCRA by adding several new provisions designed to prevent or decrease identity theft and
to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information. New duties are imposed on both consumer
reporting agencies and on businesses that furnish or use information contained in consumer credit
reports. For example, a furnisher of information is required to implement procedures to prevent
the reporting of any information that it learns is the result of identity theft. Also, if a
consumer disputes the accuracy of information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the
furnisher of that information must conduct an investigation and respond to the consumer in a timely
fashion. The FACT Act also requires grantors of credit that use consumer credit report information
in making a determination to offer a borrower credit on terms that are &#147;materially less favorable&#148;
than the terms offered to most of the lender&#146;s other customers to notify the borrower that the
terms are based on a consumer credit report. In such a case the borrower is entitled to receive a
free copy of the report from the consumer reporting agency. Grantors of credit using pre-screened
consumer credit report information in credit solicitations are also required to include an enhanced
notice to consumers that they have the right to opt out from receiving further pre-screened offers
of credit. The enactment and implementation of the FACT Act has not had a significant impact on
our business or practices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act includes a provision (often referred to
as the &#147;Talent Amendment&#148;) aimed at preventing abuses of payday lending programs marketed to
members of the U.S. military services. This provision is broadly worded and could be interpreted
to impose a number of new regulatory requirements on lending products that may be marketed to
members of the armed forces. The Department of Defense has primary authority for making the rules
under which this provision would be implemented. The Company is working with industry groups to
urge the Department of Defense to craft these rules in a manner that will carry out the provision&#146;s
purpose of curbing abuses in payday lending without imposing undue regulation on lending products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Patriot Act was enacted in October&nbsp;2001 in the wake of the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act substantially
broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the
United States. The Patriot Act contains a wide variety of provisions
aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering,
including provisions aimed at impeding terrorists&#146; ability to access and move funds used in support
of terrorist activities. Among other things, the Patriot Act requires federal regulators, led by
the Secretary of the Treasury, to regulate or take other steps to require financial institutions to
establish anti-money laundering programs that meet certain standards, including expanded reporting
and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. While American Express has long
maintained anti-money laundering programs in our businesses, the Secretary of the Treasury has
issued regulations under the Patriot Act applicable to certain of our business activities conducted
within AEB, TRS and their affiliates, prescribing minimum standards for such anti-money laundering
programs, and we have enhanced existing programs and developed and implemented new ones in response
to these new regulations. For example, in April&nbsp;2002, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury issued
regulations applicable to operators of credit card networks (such as VISA, MasterCard, Diners
Club, Discover and American Express) that would require credit card networks to have risk-based
programs to screen institutions that are licensed to issue cards or acquire merchants on their
networks. As a result, we developed and implemented a program for our GNS business. We have also
developed and implemented a Customer Identification Program applicable to many of our businesses,
and we have enhanced our Know Your Customer and Enhanced Due Diligence programs in others. We
intend to take steps to comply with any additional regulations that are adopted. In addition, we
will take steps to comply with anti-money laundering initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in
which we conduct business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the use of our Card products, Travelers
Cheques, travel and other financial products and services in countries outside the United States
and continue to broaden the use of these products and services outside the United States. (For a
discussion of our revenue by geographic region, see Note
19 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which you can find on pages
106-109 of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders and which
is incorporated herein by reference.) Our revenues can be affected by political and economic
conditions in these countries (including the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by
the local Card issuer of obligations arising out of local Cardmembers&#146; spending outside such
country, for the payment of Card bills by Cardmembers who are billed in other than their local
currency, and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers Cheque sales).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Cardmembers&#146;
currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local
issuer of the Card in
connection with spending outside the local country. The majority of AEB&#146;s revenues are derived
from business conducted in countries outside the United States. Some of the risks attendant to
those operations include currency fluctuations and changes in political, economic and legal
environments in each such country.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to the possibility that, because of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar may be realized in amounts greater or less than the U.S. dollar amounts at which they
are currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples of transactions in which
this may occur include the purchase by Cardmembers of goods and services in a currency other than
the currency in which they are billed; the sale in one currency of a Travelers Cheque denominated
in a second currency; foreign exchange positions held by AEB as a consequence of its client-related
foreign exchange trading operations; and, in most instances, investments in foreign operations.
These risks, unless properly monitored and managed, could have an adverse effect on our operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section highlights specific risks that could affect our Company and its businesses. You
should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that
the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company.
However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those described below.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be
immaterial may also adversely affect our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or the
circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur, these events or circumstances could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.

merchants who accept our cards for payment for goods and services.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances to
drive profits, our business model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, which
represents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their Cards to purchase goods and
services on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single
revenue source. In recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discount
rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. This pressure arises, in part, due to the
regulatory pressure on our competitors outside the United States, which has been increasing. If we
continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we charge merchants or are
unable to sustain premium merchant discount rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volume
growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially and
adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>We may not be able to increase consumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business is characterized by the high level of spending by our Cardmembers. Increasing
consumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit
and charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in Card lending
balances, depend in part on our ability to develop and issue new or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brand and its attributes are key assets of the Company. Our ability to attract and retain
consumer Cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our
level of service, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity
regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential Cardmembers and
corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers and maintain
existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association,
negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny.
Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative

more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry, there are more third parties
involved in processing transactions using our Cards. If data breaches or fraud levels involving

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual
arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered
with Costco to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership
Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, most notably the airline
industry, to offer benefits to Cardmember participants. The airline industry represents a
significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies,
restructurings and other similar events. In particular, we are exposed to risk under our
agreements with Delta Air Lines, which were restructured in connection with Delta&#146;s filing for
protection under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For additional information relating to the
agreements with Delta, see &#147;Financial Review &#150; Airline
Industry Matters&#148; on page 60 of our 2006

upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain
cobrand partners, merchants, vendors and customers. If we are not able to effectively manage the
triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have
a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to
risk if we are not able to effectively manage bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and
other similar events that may occur in the airline industry or any other industry representing a

card products and services (and billed business generally) that could result from the actual or

exposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from Cardmember receivables, and our other
consumer lending activities and institutional credit risk from merchants and GNS partners. While
consumer credit risk is more closely linked to general economic conditions rather than

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational
failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk.
Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and
may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and an increase in
our reserve for loan losses may adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our
securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans
and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information that we use in
managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit
exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions
that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances
that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive full
information with respect to the credit risks of our customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also effectively manage market risk to which we are exposed. Market risk represents
the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market
variables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our Card business. Changes in the
interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the value of our assets and liabilities.
If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn
on our loans, our net finance charge revenue, and consequently our net income, could fall.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in our investment portfolio and,
in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable, including the valuation of the
interest-only strip (commonly referred to as the I/O strip) arising from our securitization of
charge and credit Card receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. We consider
operational risk to be the risk of not achieving our business objectives due to failed processes,
people or information systems, or from the external environment, such as natural disasters.
Operational risks include the risk that we may not accurately estimate the expense provision for
the cost of our Membership Rewards program, as well as the risk that we are unable to manage a
downturn in our businesses and/or negative changes in our and our subsidiaries&#146; credit ratings,
which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowing
costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and
procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other risk
management techniques may not be fully effective. See &#147;Financial Review &#150; Risk Management&#148; on
pages 49-53 of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders for a discussion of the policies and
procedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses.
Management of credit, market and operational risk requires, among other things, policies and
procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these
policies and procedures may not be fully effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, over 30% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the United States.
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and some of the revenue

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including financing from other financial
institutions and the capital markets, directly impacts our expense in operating our business and
growing our assets and therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of factors could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on
any terms both domestically and internationally (where funding transactions may be on terms more or
less favorable than in the United States), including, but not limited to, financial results and
losses, changes within our organization, specific events that adversely impact our reputation,
changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific
events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counter-party availability, changes
affecting our assets, our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings
agencies&#146; actions, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax
environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is
strongly affected by the general state of the United States and world economies, and may become
increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors. Also, we compete for funding with other
financial institutions, some of which are publicly traded. Competition from these institutions may
increase our cost of funds.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we periodically securitize Cardmember receivables and loans arising from our Card
business. Securitization involves the legal sale of beneficial interests in Cardmember receivables
and loan balances to a trust, which in turn issues securities to third-party investors
collateralized by the transferred receivables and loans, and our receipt of the proceeds from the
issuance of such securities. Although the markets for securitized credit and charge card
receivables and loans is large and well-established, if these markets experience difficulties, we
may be unable to securitize our receivables or to do so at favorable pricing levels. If we were
unable to continue to securitize our loan receivables at desired levels, we would use alternative
funding sources to meet our liquidity needs. If we were unable to find cost-effective and stable
alternatives, it could negatively impact our liquidity and potentially subject us to certain risks.

travel reservations systems, prepaid products, alternative payment mechanisms and risk management
and compliance systems. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and
potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new
services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these
new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently

institutions in the United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as a provider of
services to financial institutions. Regulation of the payments industry has increased
significantly in recent years. For example, we are subject to the regulatory requirements of the
Patriot Act, which substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. The Patriot Act requires us to create and
implement comprehensive anti-money laundering programs that meet certain standards, including
expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and record-keeping requirements, as well as
to perform due diligence on the third party institutions that issue Cards and/or acquire merchants
on our network. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or
restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to consumers, the
countries in which our charge and credit Cards may be used and where we provide private and
correspondent banking services, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept
our charge and credit Cards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Congress is also presently considering legislative initiatives in the areas of

requirements aimed at preventing the use of payment cards to unlawfully purchase prescription drugs
over the Internet. Many states are also considering a variety of similar legislation. Federal and
state law enforcement authorities have also contacted payment companies concerning these issues.
If implemented, these initiatives may require us to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee
various categories of charge and credit card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or
decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations
covering identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing
that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards.
These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with
other financial institutions, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances,
new regulations could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge or
credit cards or restricting our ability to offer existing Cards, such as stored value cards, which
could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth.

focused on credit card interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in
monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United
States. In Congress, there have been several hearings on VISA and MasterCard interchange over the
last year. During 2006, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual state
legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange or to prohibit card companies from
charging merchant discount on the state tax portion of credit card purchases. None of those bills
were enacted. It is expected that Congressional hearings and similar proposed state legislation
will continue during 2007.

For example, in the United States, we are subject to the Federal Trade Commission&#146;s information
safeguards rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The rule requires that each financial
institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program
containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution&#146;s size and complexity, the
nature and scope of the financial institution&#146;s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer
information at issue. The heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security, including
requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach, continues. In the United States,
there are a number of bills pending in Congress and there have been several Congressional hearings

security breach, and several other states are considering similar legislation. In 1995, the
European Parliament and Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonly
referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an individual&#146;s
personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.

it is concluded that a different reportable operating segment presentation (including the

SEC may also require that we restate segment information that appears in the notes to our

proceedings, including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of

and its subsidiaries are also subject to  and governmental examinations, information
gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations. The Company believes that it is not a

lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and the common law in connection with

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2001. The actions seek unspecified compensatory damages as well as disgorgement, punitive
damages, attorneys&#146; fees and costs, and interest. On March&nbsp;31, 2004, the Court granted the
Company&#146;s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August&nbsp;2006, the Court of Appeals, without expressing
any views whatsoever on the merits of the cases, vacated the District Court&#146;s judgment and remanded
all claims to the District Court for further proceedings. More particularly, the Court of Appeals
reversed the District Court&#146;s ruling that two of the plaintiff&#146;s claims in an amended complaint did
not &#147;relate back&#148; to the original complaint and were thus time-barred under the statute of
limitations period. As a result, the Court of Appeals decided that it was prudent to remand all
claims back to the District Court so that plaintiffs could file a new amended complaint.
Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January&nbsp;8, 2007. The Company wrote to the Court on
February&nbsp;5, 2007, telling the Court that it intended to file a motion to strike the amended
complaint. The Company continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses to the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. was named as a
defendant in a shareholder derivative action purportedly filed on behalf of InfoSpace Inc. The
action, captioned <U>Dreiling v. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.</U>, was
filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Washington. The complaint alleges that the
Company violated the &#147;short swing&#148; liability provisions of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, in connection with its sale of InfoSpace common stock. The plaintiff
seeks disgorgement of profits from the sale of the InfoSpace shares, as well as fees and expenses.
In June&nbsp;2004, the Court granted American Express&#146; motion to dismiss the complaint without American
Express&#146; ever having answered the complaint. In August&nbsp;2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit reinstated the action because of certain unresolved factual disputes. The Company
continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses to this action and intends to defend it
vigorously.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2006, a purported class action captioned <U>Paula Kritzman, individually and on
behalf of all others similarly situated v. American Express Retirement Plan et al.</U> was filed in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff alleges that when the
American Express Retirement Plan (the &#147;AXP Plan&#148;) was amended effective July&nbsp;1, 1995, to convert
from a final average pay formula to a &#147;cash balance&#148; formula for the calculation of benefits, the
terms of the amended AXP Plan violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended
(&#147;ERISA&#148;), in at least the following ways: (i)&nbsp;the AXP Plan violated ERISA&#146;s prohibition on
reducing rates of benefit accrual due to the increasing age of a plan participant; (ii)&nbsp;the AXP
Plan violated ERISA&#146;s prohibition on forfeiture of accrued benefits; and (iii)&nbsp;the AXP Plan
violated ERISA&#146;s present value calculation rules. The plaintiff seeks, among other remedies,
injunctive relief entitling the plaintiff and the purported class to benefits that are the greater
of (x)&nbsp;the benefits to which the members of the class would have been entitled without regard to
the conversion of the benefit payout formula of the AXP Plan to a cash balance formula and (y)&nbsp;the
benefits under the AXP Plan with regard to the cash balance formula. The plaintiff also seeks pre-
and post-judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses. The Company has filed a motion with
the Court seeking to dismiss the complaint.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, the Company filed a lawsuit captioned <U>American Express Travel Related
Services Company, Inc. v. VISA USA Inc., MasterCard International, Inc. et al.</U> in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary
damages against VISA, MasterCard and eight major banks that are or were members of the two card
associations for the business lost as a result of the illegal, anticompetitive practices of the
card associations that effectively locked the Company out of the bank-issued card business in the
United States. The lawsuit follows the U.S. Supreme Court&#146;s October&nbsp;2004 decision not to hear an
appeal from VISA and MasterCard that sought to overturn a lower court ruling that found the two
card associations in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Since filing the action, TRS has
voluntarily dismissed its claims against the following bank defendants: Bank of America, N.A., Bank
of America Corporation (including its subsidiaries Fleet Bank (RI), N.A. and Fleet National Bank),
Household Bank, N.A., Household International, Inc. and USAA Federal Savings Bank.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been named in a number of purported class actions in which the plaintiffs
allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between the Company&#146;s charge cards, credit cards and
debit cards in violation of various state and federal laws, including the following: (i) <U>Cohen
Rese Gallery et al. v. American Express Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California (filed July&nbsp;2003); (ii) <U>Italian Colors Restaurant v. American Express
Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (filed August
2003); (iii) <U>DRF Jeweler Corp. v. American Express Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York (filed December&nbsp;2003); (iv) <U>Hayama Inc. v. American Express
Company et al.</U>, Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (filed December&nbsp;2003); (v)
<U>Chez Noelle Restaurant v. American Express Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (filed January&nbsp;2004); (vi) <U>Mascari Enterprises d/b/a Sound
Stations v. American Express Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York (filed January&nbsp;2004); (vii) <U>Mims Restaurant v. American Express Company et al</U>.,
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (filed February&nbsp;2004); and (viii) <U>The
Marcus Corporation v. American Express Company et al.</U>, U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York (filed July&nbsp;2004). The plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and
an unspecified amount of damages. Upon motion to the Court by the Company, the venue of the Cohen
Rese and Italian Colors actions was moved to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York (&#147;SDNY&#148;) in December&nbsp;2003. Each of the above-listed actions (except for Hayama) is now
pending in the SDNY, consolidated as &#147;In re American Express Merchants&#146; Litigation&#148;. On April&nbsp;30,
2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss all the actions filed prior to such date that were
pending in the SDNY, and on March&nbsp;15, 2006, such motion was granted, with the Court finding the
claims of the plaintiffs to be subject to arbitration. Plaintiffs asked the Court to reconsider
its dismissal. That request was denied. The plaintiffs have appealed the Court&#146;s arbitration
ruling. In addition, during the pendency of the motion in the SDNY, the Company had asked the
California Superior Court hearing the Hayama action referenced above to stay that action pending
resolution of such motion. The Company also filed a motion to dismiss the action filed by the
Marcus Corporation, which was denied in July&nbsp;2005. Nonetheless, the Company continues to believe
that it has meritorious defenses and will continue to vigorously defend against the Marcus action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, a purported class action captioned <U>National Supermarkets Association,
Inc., Mascari Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Sound Stations, and Bunda Starr Corp. d/b/a Brite Wines and
Spirits v. MBNA America Bank, N.A., MBNA Corp., Citibank (South Dakota) N.A. and Citigroup,
Incorporated</U>, was filed in the SDNY. The action is a lawsuit related to the antitrust tying
actions described in the preceding paragraph. Although the Company is not named as a defendant,
the plaintiffs in this action are also plaintiffs in the direct actions against American Express
described in the preceding paragraph. This lawsuit alleges that, by agreeing to issue American
Express-branded cards, MBNA and Citibank have conspired with the Company in the alleged wrongful
tying arrangement described in the preceding paragraph. The Company believes this lawsuit is
without merit and is contrary to the Department of Justice&#146;s successful efforts to render
unenforceable Visa&#146;s and MasterCard&#146;s rules that prevented
banks from issuing American Express-branded cards in the United States. The Company also believes that this lawsuit is susceptible to
the same defenses available to the Company in the direct actions filed against it, which are
described in the preceding paragraph. In the March&nbsp;15, 2006 decision described in the preceding
paragraph, the SDNY denied the Company&#146;s request to intervene in this action and denied the motion
of MBNA and Citibank to dismiss the action. The Court did, however, stay the action against MBNA
and Citibank pending the arbitration of the claims made against the Company in the actions
described in the preceding paragraph.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2005, a purported class action captioned <U>Performance Labs Inc. v. American
Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (&#147;TRS&#148;), MasterCard International Incorporated, Visa
USA, Inc. et al.</U> was filed in the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The
action was then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The
complaint alleged that the Company&#146;s policy prohibiting merchants from imposing restrictions on the
use of American Express cards that are not imposed equally on other forms of payment violates U.S.
antitrust laws. The suit sought injunctive relief. TRS moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition,
the Company learned that two additional purported class actions that made allegations similar to
those made in the Performance Labs action had also been filed: <U>518 Restaurant Corp. v. American
Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., MasterCard International Incorporated, Visa USA,
Inc. et al.</U> (filed in August&nbsp;2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania) and <U>Lepkowski v. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.,
MasterCard International Incorporated, Visa USA, Inc. et al.</U> (filed in October&nbsp;2005 in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York). The plaintiffs in these actions sought
injunctive relief. The 518 Restaurant Corp. action was voluntarily withdrawn without TRS ever
having been served with the complaint. The complaint in the Lepkowski action was also never served.
The Lepkowski and Performance Labs cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York for pre-trial purposes in a larger multi-district litigation involving
other named defendants not affiliated with the Company, and all proceedings in the consolidated
action were stayed pending the filing of a consolidated amended complaint. Such consolidated
amended complaint was filed on April&nbsp;24, 2006, but the Company was not named in that action. Other
defendants, not affiliated with the Company, were named. However, on April&nbsp;18, 2006, Performance
Labs, Inc., Joseph Lepkowski, DDS d/b/a Oak Park Dental Studio, and Jasa Inc. filed an action in
the SDNY against American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company,
Inc. This complaint challenges the Company&#146;s &#147;Anti-Steering&#148; rules as unlawful under the antitrust
laws. As alleged by plaintiffs, these rules prevent merchants from offering consumers

Express-branded card. Originally plaintiffs sought only injunctive relief but have since amended
their complaint to also seek unspecified damages. These plaintiffs have agreed that a stay would be

ruling discussed above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has been named in several purported class actions in various state courts alleging
that the Company violated the respective state&#146;s laws by wrongfully collecting amounts assessed on
converting transactions made in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars and/or failing to properly
disclose the existence of such amounts in its Cardmember agreements and billing statements. The
plaintiffs in the actions seek, among other remedies, injunctive relief, money damages and/or
attorneys&#146; fees on their own behalf and on behalf of the putative class of persons similarly
situated. In December&nbsp;2005, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted
final approval of a nationwide class action settlement to resolve all lawsuits and allegations with
respect to the Company&#146;s collection and disclosure of fees assessed on transactions made in foreign
currencies in the case captioned <U>Lipuma v. American Express Bank, American Express Travel
Related Services Company, Inc. and American Express Centurion Bank</U> (filed in August&nbsp;2003). The
settlement approved by the Court calls for the Company to (a)&nbsp;deposit $75&nbsp;million into a fund that
will be used to reimburse class members with valid claims, make certain contributions to charitable
organizations to be identified later and pay attorneys&#146; fees and (b)&nbsp;make certain changes to the
disclosures in its Cardmember agreements and billing statements regarding its foreign currency
conversion practices (which it has already done). The Company had previously established reserves
to cover the payment that will be made to reimburse class members and pay attorneys&#146; fees. The
Court&#146;s approval order enjoins all other proceedings that make related allegations pending a final
approval hearing including, but not limited to the following cases: (i) <U>Environmental Law
Foundation, et al. v. American Express Company, et al.</U>, Superior Court of Alameda County,
California (filed March&nbsp;2003); (ii) <U>Rubin v. American Express Company and American Express

in states other than California and who purchased American Express fee-based travel-related
insurance plans from September&nbsp;6, 1995, through a date to be determined. Plaintiffs allege that
American Express violated California and New York law by allegedly billing customers for flight and
baggage insurance that they did not receive. American Express denies the allegations and filed an
interlocutory appeal (known as a petition for a writ of mandate) of the class certification order.
In June&nbsp;2006, the appellate court denied jurisdiction over that interlocutory appeal. American
Express also appealed the denial of its motion to compel individual arbitration of all
non-California class members. The appellate court has jurisdiction over that appeal and the appeal
is pending. In the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York a matter making related
allegations to those raised in Hoffman is pending. That matter, captioned <U>Environment Law
Enforcement Systems v. American Express et al.</U>, had effectively been stayed pending the
proceedings in the Hoffman action. In October&nbsp;2006, the Court in the Environment Law action entered
an order scheduling a pre-motion conference on American Express&#146; anticipated motion to compel
arbitration for January&nbsp;31, 2007. That date has since been extended to March&nbsp;5, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2006, a putative class action captioned <U>Homa v. American Express Company et
al</U>. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges,
generally, misleading and fraudulent advertising of the &#147;tiered&#148; &#147;up to 5%&#148; cash rebates with the
Blue Cash card. The complaint initially sought certification of a nationwide class consisting of
&#147;all persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from
September&nbsp;30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the rebate or rebates provided for in the
offer.&#148; On December&nbsp;1, 2006, however, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint dropping the
nationwide class claims and asserting claims only on behalf of New Jersey residents who &#147;while so
residing in New Jersey, applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described elsewhere in this report, in recent years, U.S. and foreign regulatory
authorities, together with international organizations, have raised increasing concerns over the
ability of criminal organizations and corrupt persons to use global financial intermediaries to
facilitate money laundering. In the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury has issued
regulations pursuant to the U.S. Patriot Act that specifically impact certain money laundering
prevention activities of entities involved, as AEBL is, in correspondent and private banking
activities. Compliance efforts to combat money laundering remain a high priority for AEBL and it
has increased these efforts to address evolving regulatory and supervisory standards and
requirements in jurisdictions in which AEBL does business. The
regulatory authorities are exercising heightened scrutiny of the
anti-money laundering programs of financial institutions and have
taken action against financial institutions for deficiencies in such
programs. In early 2004, AEBI, a subsidiary of
AEBL headquartered in Miami, received subpoenas from the Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) relating to
certain customer accounts and anti-money laundering (&#147;AML&#148;) compliance programs. In September&nbsp;2006,
the DOJ informed AEBI of concerns relating to AML compliance programs that could result in an
action. AEBI has been cooperating with the DOJ.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2006, in a matter captioned <U>Marcotte v. Bank of Montreal et al.</U>, filed in the
Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in April&nbsp;2003) the Court
authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank,
Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Scotiabank, National Bank of Canada,
Laurentian Bank of Canada and Citibank Canada. The action alleges that conversion commissions made
on foreign currency transactions are credit charges under the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (the
&#147;QCPA&#148;) and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class includes
all persons holding a credit card issued by one of the defendants to whom fees were charged since
April&nbsp;17, 2000, for transactions made in foreign currency before expiration of the period of 21
days following the statement of account. The class claims reimbursement of all foreign currency
conversions, CDN $400 per class member for trouble, inconvenience and punitive damages, interest
and fees and costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2006, a motion to authorize a class action captioned <U>Jasmin v. Amex Bank of
Canada</U>, was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal. The motion purports
to claim, on behalf of a Canada-wide class of persons who were holders of an American Express
Credit Card who paid their credit card account at the counter or at an automatic banking machine of
an authorized financial institution, and who obtained a grace period that was less than that
appearing on their statement of account and/or who were charged interest under a three- to five-
day processing delay contrary to their contracts, the law respecting banks and the Civil Code of
Quebec. A claim is also being made of an alleged violation of the Charter of Human Rights and
Freedoms for depriving the class members of their use of property. The class claims reimbursement
per class member of finance charges in the amount of CDN $75, CDN $100 in punitive damages and CDN
$25 for having to pay their account early and being deprived of the use of their money, interest,
fees and costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2006, in a matter captioned <U>Ptack v. Amex Bank of Canada</U>, filed in the
Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in March&nbsp;2004), the Court
authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The class includes all persons who were
holders of an American Express Credit Card who paid their credit card account via Internet,
telephone and/or automatic banking machine, on or before the due date and incurred a finance charge
as a result of the alleged payment processing policy of Amex Bank. The class claims reimbursement
per class member of finance charges, CDN $100 in punitive damages and CDN $100 for waste of time,
interest and fees and costs. Amex Bank believes it has meritorious defenses and will defend
against this action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2006, in a matter captioned <U>Option Consommateurs and Benoit Fortin v. Amex
Bank of Canada et al.</U> filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally
filed in July&nbsp;2003), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Citibank
Canada, MBNA Canada, Diners Club International, Capital One and Royal Bank of Canada. The
plaintiff alleges that the defendants have violated the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (&#147;QCPA&#148;) by
imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to 21&nbsp;days following the receipt of the
statement containing the charge. It is alleged that the QCPA provisions which require a 21-day
grace period prior to imposing finance charges applies to credit cards issued by Amex Bank of
Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this grace period violate the Act. The
class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges imposed in violation of the Act, CDN$200 in
punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2006, in a matter captioned <U>Sylvan Adams v. Amex Bank of Canada</U> filed in
the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in November&nbsp;2004), the Court
authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that prior to
December&nbsp;2003, Amex Bank of Canada charged a foreign currency conversion commission on transactions
to purchase goods and services in currencies other than Canadian dollars and failed to disclose the
commissions in monthly billing statements or solicitations directed to prospective cardmembers.
The class, consisting of all Cardmembers in Quebec that purchased goods or services in a foreign
currency prior to December&nbsp;2003, claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversion
commissions, CDN$1,000 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2005, Amex Bank of Canada was added as a defendant to a motion to authorize a class
action captioned <U>Option Consommateurs and Joel-Christian St-Pierre v. Bank of Montreal et
al.</U> filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Quebec. The motion, which also names as
defendants Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, HSBC Bank of Canada, among others, alleges
that the defendants violated QCPA by imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to
21&nbsp;days following the receipt of the statement containing the charge. It is alleged that the QCPA
provisions, which require a 21-day grace period prior to imposing finance charges, applies to
credit cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this
grace period violate the QCPA. The proposed class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges
imposed in violation of the QCPA, CDN$100 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees
and costs.
