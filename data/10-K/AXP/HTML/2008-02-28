believe that our &#147;spend-centric&#148; business model (which focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our Cards and secondarily by finance charges and fees) has significant competitive advantages. Average spending per
Card, which is substantially higher for us versus our competitors, represents greater value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and higher sales. This enables us to earn a premium discount rate and thereby invest in greater value-added
services for merchants and Cardmembers. As a result of the higher revenues generated from higher spending, we have the flexibility to offer more attractive rewards, other incentives to Cardmembers and targeted marketing programs for merchants, which
in turn create an incentive for Cardmembers to spend more on their Cards. This business model, along with our closed loop network, in which we are both the card issuer and, in most instances, the merchant acquirer, gives us a competitive advantage
that we seek to leverage to provide more value to Cardmembers, merchants and Card issuing partners. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>The American Express Brand </B></FONT></P> <P

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although the structures and details for each of the GNS arrangements vary, all of them generate revenues for us from the Card transaction volumes they drive on the American Express network. Gross revenues we receive
per dollar spent on a Card issued by a GNS partner are lower than those from our proprietary Card issuing business. However, because the GNS partner is responsible for most of the operating costs and risk of its Card issuing business, our operating
expenses and credit losses are lower than those in our proprietary Card issuing business. The GNS business model generates an attractive earnings stream and risk profile that requires a lower level of capital support. The return on equity in our GNS
business can thus be significantly higher than that of our proprietary Card issuing business. Because the majority of GNS costs are fixed, the GNS business is highly scalable. GNS partners benefit from their association with the American Express
brand and their ability to gain attractive revenue streams and expand and differentiate their product offerings with innovative marketing programs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%;padding-bottom:3px;line-Height:95%; vertical-align:top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The first type of GNS arrangement is known as an independent operator (&#147;IO&#148;) arrangement.
As of the end of 2007, we had 59 of these arrangements around the world. We pursue these arrangements to expand the presence of the American Express network throughout the world, in markets in which we do not offer a proprietary local currency Card.
Under this type of arrangement, the partner&#146;s local presence and relationships help us enhance the impact of our brand in the market, reach merchant coverage goals more quickly, and operate at economic scale and cost levels that would be
difficult for us to achieve on our own. Subject to meeting our standards, we license our IO bank partners to issue local currency Cards in their markets, including the classic Green, Gold and Platinum American Express<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="1"><SUP>&reg;</SUP></FONT> Cards. In addition, the majority of these partners serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local merchants. American Express retains the relationship with multi-national merchants. Our IO partners own the
customer relationships and credit risk for the Cards they issue, and make the decisions about which customers will be issued Cards. GNS generates revenues in IO arrangements from Card licensing fees, royalties on Cardmember billings, foreign
exchange conversion revenue, royalties on merchant acquisition volume, discount revenue and, in some partnerships, royalties on net spread revenue. Our IO partners are responsible for transaction authorization, billing and pricing, Cardmember and
merchant servicing and funding Card receivables for their Cards and payables for their merchants. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We bear the risk arising from the IO
partner&#146;s potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We mitigate this risk by partnering with independent operators that we believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by monitoring their financial
health, their compliance with the terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition, we generally require IO partners to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other
collateral to reduce this risk. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Examples of countries where we have entered into IO arrangements include Brazil, Russia, China, Ecuador,
Greece, South Korea, Pakistan, Croatia, Peru, Portugal and Vietnam. In 2007, we sold our local proprietary Card issuing business in the Philippines and our local merchant acquiring business in Russia. Through our IO partnerships, we believe we can
accelerate growth in Cardmember spending, Cards-in-force and merchant acceptance in these countries. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Network Card License

SIZE="2">However, as a consequence of the decision in a lawsuit filed in October 1998 by the U.S. Department of Justice against Visa and MasterCard in which such rules and policies were found to violate the U.S. antitrust laws, these rules and
policies were finally repealed in late 2004. The Supreme Court&#146;s decision not to hear Visa&#146;s and MasterCard&#146;s appeal of the lower courts&#146; rulings against them cleared the way for implementation of the trial court&#146;s order
requiring the repeal of the illegal rules and policies. We view this decision as a major victory for U.S. consumers as well as U.S. banks because it opened the door to more vigorous network competition and more innovative card products and services.

coverage in accordance with changes in the marketplace. Management estimates that, as of the end of 2007, our merchant network in the United States accommodated more than 90% of our Cardmembers&#146; general purpose charge and credit card spending,
and our international merchant network as a whole accommodated approximately 80% of our Cardmembers&#146; general purpose charge and credit card spending. These percentages are based on comparing our Cardmembers&#146; spending on our network

acquirer&#148; (in most cases, TRS or one of its subsidiaries) pays to a merchant for Charges submitted. A merchant acquirer is the entity that contracts for Card acceptance with the merchant, accepts transactions from the merchant, pays the
merchant for these transactions and submits the transactions to the American Express network, which submits the transactions to the appropriate Card issuer. When a Cardmember presents the Card for payment, the merchant creates a record of charge for
the transaction and submits it to the merchant acquirer for payment. To the extent that TRS or one of its subsidiaries is the merchant acquirer, the merchant discount is recorded by us as discount revenue at the time the transaction is received by

between the discount revenue (received by us in the form of the merchant discount) and the issuer rate received by the Card issuer generates a return to us. Where we are the Card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third-party bank or financial
institution (which can be the case in a country in which the IO is the local merchant acquirer), we receive an individually negotiated issuer rate in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is recorded by us as discount revenue. By contrast

settled in favor of the Cardmember. Drivers of this liability are returns in the normal course of business, disputes over fraudulent charges, the quality or non-delivery of goods and services and billing errors. Typically, we offset the amount due
to the Cardmember against payments for the merchant&#146;s current or future Charge submissions. We can realize losses when a merchant&#146;s offsetting charge submissions cease, such as when the merchant commences a bankruptcy proceeding or goes
out of business. We actively monitor our merchant base to assess the risk of this exposure. When appropriate, we will take action to reduce the net exposure to a given merchant by requiring a parent company guarantee or letter of credit, holding
cash reserves funded through Charge payable holdbacks from a merchant, lengthening the time between when the merchant submits a Charge for payment and when we pay the merchant or implementing other appropriate risk management tools. We also

data over merchants&#146; point-of-sale systems, the necessity for merchants and merchant processors to secure this data against accidental or intentional compromise using a standard protocol that applies to all card types, became clear to American
Express and the other major card networks. In 2006, in order to strengthen the security practices of merchants and payment processing firms and to secure payment account data in a globally consistent manner, we and Discover Financial Services, JCB,
MasterCard Worldwide and Visa formed PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (&#147;PCI SSC&#148;), an independent standards-setting organization to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, which focuses on
improving payment card account security throughout the transaction process. By establishing PCI SSC to manage the PCI Data Security Standard, we and the other founders have developed a common standard that is more accessible and efficient for
participants in the payment card industry. All our merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. PCI SSC is dedicated to driving greater education,

currency conversion process, the merchant and processor share any fee assessed or spread earned for converting the transaction at the point of sale, thus reducing or eliminating revenue for card issuers and card networks relating to the conversion

mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions), pre-paid systems and systems linked to credit cards, and bank transfer models. In the United States, alternative payment vehicles continue to emerge that seek to re-direct online customers to
payment systems based on ACH (automated clearing house, i.e., inter-bank transfer), and existing debit networks are making efforts to develop online PIN functionality, which could potentially reduce the relative use of charge and credit cards

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Local regulations governing the issuance of charge and credit cards have not been a significant factor impacting our Global Network Services&#146; arrangements with banks and qualifying financial institutions, because
such banks and institutions generally are already authorized to issue general purpose cards and, in the case of our IO arrangements, to operate merchant acquiring businesses. Accordingly, our GNS partners have generally not had difficulty in
obtaining appropriate government authorization in the markets in which we have chosen to enter into GNS arrangements. As a network service provider to regulated U.S. banks, our GNS business is subject to review by certain federal bank regulators,
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. As the operator of a general purpose card network, we are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the
&#147;Patriot Act&#148;), which requires us to conduct due diligence on our GNS partners to ensure that they maintain sufficient anti-money laundering and &#147;know your customer&#148; programs to prevent our network from being used for money
laundering or terrorist financing. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the United States have focused on the fees
involved in the operation of card networks, including the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators in the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Spain, Hungary, the European Union (EU), Australia, Mexico, and Switzerland, among others, have
conducted investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the &#147;interchange,&#148; which is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in &#147;four-party&#148; payment networks, like Visa and
MasterCard. The interchange fee is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge charged to merchants for bankcard debit and credit charges in these systems<B>. </B>By contrast, the American Express network does not have
collectively-set interchange fees.<B> </B>Although the regulators&#146; focus has primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the dominant card networks and their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation of the
bankcard associations&#146; pricing could ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees, interest charges, as well as to
reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In certain countries where antitrust actions or regulations have led our
competitors to lower their fees, we have made adjustments to our pricing to merchants to reflect local competitive trends. For example, reductions in bankcard interchange mandated by the Reserve Bank of Australia reforms in 2003 have resulted in
lower merchant discount rates for Visa and MasterCard acceptance. As a result of changes in the marketplace, we have reduced our own merchant discount rates in Australia although we have been able to increase billed business and the number of
merchants accepting our Cards. In addition, under legislation enacted in Argentina, a merchant acquirer is required to charge the same merchant discount rate to all merchants in the same industry category, and merchant discount rates for credit
cards cannot exceed 3%. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In Europe, interchange is usually handled as a matter for the domestic competition law authority, as well as the
European Commission. In its Final Report on the retail banking sector issued in January 2007, which included a review of the payment cards industry, including interchange fees, the European Commission appeared to favor competition law enforcement
tools, rather than regulation of price levels, to address perceived issues of insufficient competition. The conclusions of the European Commission in its Final Report do not have the force of law, but may be used as the basis for future regulation
or antitrust enforcement action in the EU Member States. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In December 2007, the European Commission ruled that MasterCard&#146;s
multilateral interchange fees (MIF) for cross-border payment card transactions violate EC Treaty rules on restrictive business practices. MasterCard has indicated it will comply, although it is also lodging an appeal against the Commission&#146;s
findings. The ruling does not prevent MasterCard and its member banks from adopting an alternative MIF arrangement that can be proven to comply with EU Competition rules. However, based upon the information available to American Express, the
Commission does not appear to have set out any particular methodology for how MIF should be calculated in a way that would comply with the rules. The Commission&#146;s decision applies to cross-border consumer credit, charge and debit card
transactions within the EU and to domestic transactions to which </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">MasterCard has chosen to apply the cross-border MIF. Although the Commission&#146;s investigation included commercial cards, the decision does not apply to
commercial cards. The Commission is likely to produce another decision regarding MIF for commercial card transactions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In 2002, the
Commission granted an exemption to Visa regarding its MIFs. This exemption expired on December&nbsp;31, 2007. The Commission has indicated that the MasterCard decision should &#147;provide Visa with guidance for the way ahead,&#148; although it
stated that &#147;every MIF must be examined on its own merits.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">These developments may impact how the competition authorities in the
Member States of the EU view domestic interchange. Earlier in 2007, for example, the competition regulator in Poland found insufficient basis for Visa and MasterCard interchange fees and ordered the associations and their members to stop their
current interchange setting practices with immediate effect. The banks are appealing that decision. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Regulators, including most recently
the European Commission, have considered the industry practice of prohibiting merchants from passing the cost of merchant discount fees along to consumers through surcharges on </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">card purchases. Although some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have for a number of years permitted merchants to levy a surcharge on credit card purchases, there has to date been a relatively low overall
incidence of surcharging, as merchants do not want to risk offending customers or losing them to competitors that do not assess surcharges for credit card purchases. In its Final Report, the European Commission indicated that prohibiting surcharging
appeared to restrict inter-network competition and may constitute a barrier to entry for alternative, non-cash payment instruments. In Australia, we have seen selective, but increasing merchant surcharging on our Cards in certain industries and, in
some cases, on a basis that is greater than that applied to cards issued on the bankcard networks. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The European Union has adopted a new
legislative framework for electronic payment services, including cards, referred to as the Payment Services Directive. The Payment Services Directive prescribes common rules for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card
issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business. The objective of the Payment Services Directive is to facilitate the creation of a single, internal payments market in the EU through harmonization of EU Member State laws governing
payment services. The Payment Services Directive must be incorporated into the national law of each EU Member State by November 2009. By the end of April 2011, licensing will be required and supervision will commence for American Express&#146; card
operations in the EU. One provision of the Payment Services Directive permits merchants to surcharge, subject to disclosure requirements, but also allows individual Member States to override this rule by prohibiting surcharging. The Payment Services
Directive complements another European initiative, the Single Euro Payments Area (&#147;SEPA&#148;), which is an industry-led initiative with support from EU institutions. Among other changes, SEPA will involve the adoption of new, pan-European
technical standards for cards and card transactions. All of the foregoing will entail costs to implement and maintain. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the United
States, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and various Federal Reserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences focused on interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed
interest in monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United States. In Congress, there have been several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last two years, and at the request of
Congress, the Government Accountability Office undertook a study of the cost of credit card acceptance to federal agencies. During 2007, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual state legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit
card interchange or to prohibit card companies from charging merchant discount on the state tax portion of credit card purchases. Other proposals were aimed at increasing the transparency of card network rules for merchants. In addition, a number of
bills were proposed to establish merchant liability for the costs of a data security breach of a merchant&#146;s system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to protect sensitive card holder payment information. It is expected that
Congressional hearings and similar proposed state legislation will continue during 2008. It is possible that some of these proposals could surface at the federal level as well. In the event that governmental or regulatory activity to limit
interchange or merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security legislation is adopted, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

significant, based primarily on the amount of Cardmember spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. We expense amounts due under co-brand arrangements
in the month earned. Payment terms vary by arrangement, but are monthly or quarterly. Generally, once we make payment to the co-brand partner, the partner is solely liable for providing rewards to the Cardmember under the co-brand partner&#146;s own
loyalty program. As the issuer of the co-brand card, we retain all the credit risk with the Cardmember and bear the receivables funding and operating expenses for such cards. The co-brand partner retains the risk associated with the miles, points or
other currency earned by the Cardmember under the partner&#146;s loyalty program. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Co-brand Partnerships with Financial Services Institutions</I>
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We also issue Cards that are marketed under co-brand partnership arrangements with financial services partners. Such partnerships involve
the offering of a standard product (issued by TRS or one of its subsidiaries) to customers of the financial services partner, generally co-branded with the partner&#146;s name on the Card. Under these arrangements, we make payments to the financial
services partners that are primarily based on the number of accounts acquired and retained through the arrangement and the amount of Cardmember spending on such Cards. The duration of such arrangements generally ranges from three to seven years.

STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our proprietary Card business encounters substantial and intense competition in the United States and internationally. As a card issuer, we compete in the
United States with financial institutions (such as Citibank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Capital One Financial) that issue general purpose charge and credit cards, primarily under revolving credit plans, and Discover Financial Services,
which issues the Discover Card on the Discover Business Services network. We also encounter limited competition from businesses that issue their own cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers, such as retailers and airline associations,
although these cards are generally accepted only at limited locations. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a smaller number
of significant issuers. The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains intense.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Competing card issuers offer a variety of products and services to attract cardholders, including premium cards with enhanced services or
lines of credit, airline frequent flyer program mileage credits, cash rebates and other reward or rebate programs, services for small business owners, &#147;teaser&#148; promotional interest rates for both credit card acquisition and balance
transfers, and co-branded arrangements with partners that offer benefits to cardholders. In recent years we have encountered increasingly intense competition in the small business sector, as competitors have targeted OPEN&#146;s customer base and
our leadership position in providing financial services to small businesses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Most financial institutions that offer demand deposit
accounts also issue debit cards to permit depositors to access their funds. Use of debit cards for point-of-sale purchases has grown as most financial institutions have replaced ATM cards with general purpose debit cards bearing either the Visa or
MasterCard logo. As a result, the volume of transactions made with debit cards in the United States has continued to increase significantly and has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions. Debit cards are marketed as replacements
for cash and checks, and transactions made with debit cards are typically for small dollar amounts. The ability to substitute debit cards for credit and charge cards is limited because there is no credit extended and the consumer must have
sufficient funds in his or her demand deposit account to pay for the purchase at the time of the transaction. We do not currently issue point-of-sale debit cards for use on the American Express network. </FONT></P> <P

the principal U.S. federal entities that regulate banks and other financial institutions, issued new guidance to the industry on credit card account management and loss allowance practices (the &#147;Guidance&#148;). The Guidance covers five areas:
(i)&nbsp;credit line management; (ii)&nbsp;over-limit practices; (iii)&nbsp;minimum payment and negative amortization practices; (iv)&nbsp;workout and forbearance practices; and (v)&nbsp;certain income (fee) recognition and loss allowance practices.
The Guidance is generally applicable to all institutions under the supervision of the federal bank regulatory agencies that comprise the FFIEC, although it is primarily the result of the identification by bank regulators in their examinations of
other credit card lenders&#146; practices deemed by them to be inappropriate, particularly, but not exclusively, with regard to subprime lending programs. At present, we do not have any lending programs that target the subprime market. Centurion
Bank and AEBFSB evaluate and discuss the Guidance with their respective regulators on an ongoing basis as part of their regulatory examination processes, and, as a result, may refine their practices from time to time based on regulatory input. The
Guidance has not had, nor do we expect it to have, any material impact on our businesses or practices.<B> </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>American Express Consumer Travel

trends have reduced the revenue opportunities for travel agents because they do not receive distribution revenue from directly booked transactions. Recent announcements that several major airlines are in merger discussions indicate that the U.S.

adopted such legislation. For example, in 2003 California enacted that state&#146;s Financial Information Privacy Act. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable law and our internal data protection
policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft, while seeking to collect and use data properly to achieve our business objectives. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

are considering similar legislation. In addition, several states are considering legislation requiring certain data security standards that could result in higher technology costs for the Company. In 1995, the European Parliament and Council passed
European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an
individual&#146;s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. The Data Protection Directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in European Union Member States.

agencies and the use of consumer credit report information by banks and other companies. FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in December 2003 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the &#147;FACT Act&#148;). The FACT Act
requires any company that receives information concerning a consumer from an affiliate, subject to certain exceptions, to permit the consumer to opt out from having that information used to market the company&#146;s products to the consumer. In
October 2007, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing the affiliate marketing provisions of the FACT Act. Other Federal banking agencies are expected to promulgate similar rules imminently. Companies subject to FDIC oversight must comply with the
rules by October&nbsp;1, 2008. The FACT Act further amends the FCRA by adding several new provisions designed to prevent or decrease identity theft and to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information. The FDIC published a final rule in
October 2007 requiring financial institutions to implement a program containing reasonable policies and procedures to address the risk of identity theft and to identify accounts where identity theft is more likely to occur. Other Federal banking
agencies are expected to adopt similar rules in the near future. Companies subject to FDIC oversight must comply with the rule by November&nbsp;1, 2008. The FACT Act also imposes new duties on both consumer reporting agencies and on businesses that
furnish or use information contained in consumer credit reports. For example, a furnisher of information is required to implement procedures to prevent the reporting of any information that it learns is the result of identity theft. Also, if a
consumer disputes the accuracy of information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the furnisher of that information must conduct an investigation and respond to the consumer in a timely fashion. The Federal banking regulatory agencies and the
FTC have proposed rules that specify the circumstances under which furnishers of information would be required to investigate disputes regarding the accuracy of the information provided to a </FONT>

borrower credit on terms that are &#147;materially less favorable&#148; than the terms offered to most of the lender&#146;s other customers to notify the borrower that the terms are based on a consumer credit report. In such a case the borrower is

substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering (&#147;AML&#148;) and terrorist financing legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. The Patriot Act contains a wide variety of provisions aimed at fighting
terrorism and money laundering, including provisions aimed at impeding terrorists&#146; ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, the Patriot Act requires federal regulators, led by the Secretary
of the Treasury, to regulate or take other steps to require financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. While American
Express has long maintained AML programs in our businesses, the Secretary of the Treasury has issued regulations under the Patriot Act applicable to certain of our business activities conducted within AEB, TRS and their affiliates, prescribing
minimum standards for such AML programs. In response to these regulations, as well as other AML regulatory requirements that we are subject to (both in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business), we have enhanced our
existing AML compliance programs and developed and implemented new ones. For example, in April 2002, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury issued regulations applicable to operators of credit card networks (such as Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club,
Discover and American Express) that would require credit card networks to have risk-based programs to screen institutions that are licensed to issue cards or acquire merchants on their networks. As a result, we developed and implemented a program
for our GNS business. We have also developed and implemented a Customer Identification Program applicable to many of our businesses, and we have enhanced our Know Your Customer and Enhanced Due Diligence programs in others. We will take steps to
comply with any additional regulations or initiatives that are adopted, whether in the United States or in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Throughout 2007, the industry has seen, from a regulatory and enforcement perspective, an increased scrutiny of financial institutions&#146; compliance with AML requirements, including the requirements to report large
currency transactions and to file Suspicious Activity Reports. Likewise, the industry has seen an increased focus by regulators on how their regulated institutions manage their enterprise AML risk. Our AML compliance programs primarily consist of
risk-based policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report money laundering. We have committed to our consolidated supervisor, the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;), that we will complete our
efforts to develop and implement an enterprise-wide AML compliance program that will govern compliance throughout the American Express organization, and will ensure that each of its subsidiaries is provided with resources adequate to meet our legal
and regulatory obligations. We will report periodically on our progress to the OTS. During 2007, we entered into settlements with various regulators relating to deficiencies in our AML program, which resulted in fines and penalties totaling $65
million. For a discussion of our recent settlements relating to deficiencies in our AML program, see &#147;Legal Proceedings&#151;Other Matters&#148; below. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

who are billed in other than their local currency, and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers Cheque sales). Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Cardmembers&#146; currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local

September&nbsp;18, 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd. (&#147;AEBL&#148;), and American Express International Deposit Company (&#147;AEIDC&#148;), a subsidiary that issues
investment certificates to AEBL&#146;s customers, to Standard Chartered PLC (&#147;Standard Chartered&#148;) for the approximate value of $1.1 billion, subject to certain regulatory approvals. Standard Chartered will pay us an amount equal to the
net asset value of the AEBL businesses that are being sold at the closing date plus $300 million. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, this would have amounted to approximately $819 million. We also expect to realize an additional amount representing the net
asset value of AEIDC, which was also contracted to be sold to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEBL sale, through a put/call agreement. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the net asset value of that business was $232 million. This
value is expected to be realized through (1)&nbsp;dividends from the subsidiary to us and (2)&nbsp;a subsequent payment from Standard Chartered based on the net asset value of AEIDC on the date the business is transferred to them. </FONT></P> <P

within the Corporate&nbsp;&amp; Other segment until such time as AEIDC qualifies for classification as a discontinued operation, which will occur approximately one year prior to its transfer to Standard Chartered. Beginning with the third quarter of
2007, AEIDC&#146;s investment portfolio was reclassified to Trading from Available-for-Sale due to the impact on the holding period of AEIDC&#146;s investments as a result of the related AEBL sale agreement. </FONT></P> <P

Services, and the Financial Institutions Group (&#147;FIG&#148;). The Private Bank focuses on delivering an extensive range of investment management, trust and estate planning and banking services to high net worth individuals. Financial Advisory
Services provides a wide variety of local, domestic saving and investment products to affluent individuals in select markets. FIG provides financial institution clients with a wide range of correspondent banking products, including international

global nature of AEB&#146;s business activities is such that concentrations of credit to geographic regions are not unusual. AEB continually monitors and actively manages its credit concentrations to reduce the associated risk. The Private
Bank&#146;s loans are generally secured by liquid, marketable collateral. FIG controls its exposures by limiting its relationships to select banks and limiting its exposures to such banks to quantitative limits (by obligor, by country and by
exposure type) that are periodically re-evaluated; such exposures also typically carry a short-term tenure and are trade-related, which generally has a lower risk profile. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">AEB&#146;s earnings are sensitive to interest rates because the repricing of its liabilities does not, generally, match the repricing of its assets. AEB
invests deposits in excess of loans and the proceeds of investment certificates in highly-rated investment securities. It maintains mandatory investment portfolios in a number of countries as required by central banks. AEB monitors and controls its
assets-liability mismatches both on a country and global level through a rigorous Earnings at Risk process and manages the mismatch of assets and liabilities by adjusting the repricing frequency of its investments or by using derivatives.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">AEB sells foreign exchange, interest rate and equity products to its customer base and may decide to take short-term proprietary trading
positions as a result of this business. The foreign exchange, interest rate and equity risk is managed at the branch and global level through a comprehensive Value at Risk process. AEB manages counterparty credit exposure on foreign exchange and
interest rate derivatives through a dynamic mark-to-market and potential future exposure process, in which the current fair value and potential future exposure are calculated and managed against counterparty loan equivalent limits. </FONT></P> <P

and includes, in addition to charge and credit card networks, evolving alternative payment mechanisms and systems. We are the third largest general purpose charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind Visa and MasterCard, which are
larger than we are in most markets. As a result, other card issuers may be able to benefit from the strong position and marketing and pricing power of Visa and MasterCard. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services
companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of significant issuers. The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by
cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains intense. We are also subject to increasing pricing pressure from our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have developed, or may develop,
substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant
acceptance than we have. We may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats. In addition, our competitors may be more efficient in introducing innovative products, programs and services than we are. As a result, our revenue
or profitability may decline. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, which represents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their Cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is
primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. This pressure arises, in part, due
to the regulatory pressure on our competitors outside the United States, which has been increasing. If we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we charge merchants or are unable to sustain premium merchant discount
rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volume growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected. </FONT></P> <P

consumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit and charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in Card lending balances, depend in part on our ability to develop and
issue new or enhanced Card and prepaid products and increase revenues from such products. It also depends on our ability to attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition, increase merchant coverage, and capture a greater share of
customers&#146; total spending on Cards issued on our network, both in the United States and in our international operations. One of the ways in which we attract new Cardmembers is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Cardmember
benefits. We may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand Cardmember benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and Cardmember services expenses. In addition, many credit card issuers have
instituted rewards programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the future institute rewards programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs. If we are not successful in increasing consumer and business spending or in
managing the costs of our Cardmember benefits, our revenues and profitability could be negatively affected. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Our brand and reputation

attributes are key assets of the Company. Our ability to attract and retain consumer Cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, business practices and financial condition. Negative
perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential Cardmembers and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers and maintain existing ones. Adverse
developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to
our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>An

may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our charge and credit Cards and result in increasing delinquencies and credit losses. Political or economic instability in
certain regions or countries could also affect our commercial or other lending activities, among other businesses, or result in restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies. In addition, our travel network may be adversely affected by world
geopolitical and other conditions. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. </FONT></P> <P

including our information technology systems. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus may decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about

contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Costco to offer co-branded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with
businesses in many industries, most notably the airline industry, to offer benefits to Cardmember participants. The airline industry represents a significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies,
restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. In addition, under some types of these contractual arrangements, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated </FONT></P> <P

the United States. We would not expect consolidation to have any significant effect on our merchant relationships with the airlines. However, airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in our Membership Rewards program. If a
participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in Membership Rewards, the combined airline would have to determine whether or not to continue participation. Similarly, if one of our co-brand airline partners merged with an

cost savings and other benefits (including the reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing, promotion and rewards), enhance revenue-generating opportunities and improve our operating expense to revenue ratio both in the short-term
and over time. These efforts include cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain
functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the Internet to save costs and planned staff reductions relating to certain of these reengineering actions. If we do not successfully achieve these efforts in a
timely manner or if we are not able to capitalize on these efforts, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits that we intended. Failure to achieve these benefits could have a negative effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B></B><B><I>Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.</I></B><B> </B></FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, settlement risk with regard to GNS partners, merchant bankruptcies, the
rate of bankruptcies, and other credit trends which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our card products. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. We are exposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from Cardmember
receivables and our other consumer lending activities, and institutional credit risk from merchants and GNS partners. While consumer credit risk is more closely linked to general economic conditions than borrower-specific events like institutional
credit risk, both expose us to a risk of loss. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk.
Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and an increase in our reserve for loan losses may adversely affect our
profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although we make estimates to provide for
credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information that we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit
exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as
fraud. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of our customers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We must also effectively manage
market risk to which we are exposed. Market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our Card business. Changes in the
interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net finance charge revenue, and
consequently our net income, could fall. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Additionally, we must also effectively manage liquidity risk to which we are exposed. Liquidity risk is defined as the inability to access cash and
equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy our obligations. If we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, or we may be too illiquid,
which could result in financial distress during a liquidity event. For additional information regarding our management of liquidity risk, see &#147;<I>Our access to financing, including securitizations, may be limited</I>&nbsp;&#148; below.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. We consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving
our business objectives due to failed processes, people or information systems, or from the external environment, such as natural disasters. Operational risks include the risk that we may not comply with specific regulatory or legal requirements,
exposing us to fines and/or penalties and possibly brand damage; employee error or intentional misconduct that results in a material financial misstatement; or a failure to monitor an outsource partner&#146;s compliance with a service level
agreement, resulting in economic harm to us. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and

subject to numerous regulations applicable to financial institutions in the United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as a provider of services to financial institutions. Regulation of the payments industry has increased
significantly in recent years. For example, we are subject to the regulatory requirements of the Patriot Act, which substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. The
Patriot Act requires us to create and implement comprehensive anti-money laundering programs that meet certain standards, including expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and record-keeping requirements, as well as to perform due
diligence on the third party institutions that issue Cards and/or acquire merchants on our network. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services
that we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our charge and credit Cards may be used, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our charge and credit Cards. In addition, the European Union has adopted a new
legislative directive for electronic payment services, including cards, that will put in place a common legal framework for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct
of business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The U.S. Congress is also presently considering, or may consider, legislative initiatives in the area of Internet

payment cards to unlawfully purchase prescription drugs over the Internet.<B> </B>Federal and state law enforcement authorities have also contacted payment companies concerning these issues. If implemented, these initiatives may require us to
monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of charge and credit card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering
regulations covering identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards. These new requirements may restrict our
ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge or

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators in
the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Spain, Hungary, the European Union (EU), Australia, Mexico, and Switzerland, among others, have conducted investigations into the way bankcard network members collectively set the &#147;interchange,&#148; which
is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in &#147;four-party&#148; payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard. The interchange fee is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge charged to
merchants for bankcard debit and credit charges in these systems. By contrast, the American Express network does not have collectively-set interchange fees.<B> </B>Although the regulators&#146; focus has primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the
dominant card networks and their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard associations&#146; pricing could ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may
lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees and interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs. </FONT></P> <P

Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences focused on interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange
rates in the United States. In Congress, there have been several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last two years, and at the request of Congress, the Government Accountability Office undertook a study of the cost of credit card
acceptance to federal agencies. During 2007, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual state legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange or to prohibit card companies from charging merchant discount on the state tax
portion of credit card purchases. Other proposals were aimed at increasing the transparency of card network rules for merchants. In addition, a number of bills were proposed to establish merchant liability for the costs of a data security breach of
a merchant&#146;s system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to protect sensitive card holder payment information. It is expected that Congressional hearings and similar proposed state legislation will continue during 2008. It is
possible that some of these proposals could surface at the federal level as well. In the event that governmental or regulatory activity to limit interchange or merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security legislation is adopted, our

each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution&#146;s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the
financial institution&#146;s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach, continues.
In the United States, there are a number of bills pending in Congress and there have been several Congressional hearings to address these issues. Congress will likely consider data security/data breach legislation in 2008 that, if implemented, could

<U>Paula Kritzman, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. American Express Retirement Plan et al.</U> was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff alleges that when the American
Express Retirement Plan (the &#147;AXP Plan&#148;) was amended effective July&nbsp;1, 1995, to convert from a final average pay formula to a &#147;cash balance&#148; formula for the calculation of benefits, the terms of the amended AXP Plan violated
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;), in at least the following ways: (i)&nbsp;the AXP Plan violated ERISA&#146;s prohibition on reducing rates of benefit accrual due to the increasing age of a plan
participant; (ii)&nbsp;the AXP Plan violated ERISA&#146;s prohibition on forfeiture of accrued benefits; and (iii)&nbsp;the AXP Plan violated ERISA&#146;s present value calculation rules. The plaintiff seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief
entitling the plaintiff and the purported class to benefits that are the greater of (x)&nbsp;the benefits to which the members of the class would have been entitled without regard to the conversion of the benefit payout formula of the AXP Plan to a

charitable organizations to be identified later and pay attorneys&#146; fees and (b)&nbsp;make certain changes to the disclosures in its Cardmember agreements and billing statements regarding its foreign currency conversion practices (which it has

the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#147;FinCEN&#148;) of the Department of Treasury informed AEBI of potential enforcement actions relating to its AML programs. Also, in June 2007, FinCEN informed TRS that it separately had concerns relating
to TRS&#146;s compliance with the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act regarding the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports in connection with its travelers check business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During the first quarter of 2007, the Company established a reserve in the amount of $60 million for regulatory and legal matters at AEBI. The Company increased the reserve during the second quarter of 2007 for the
resolution of the matters. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On August&nbsp;6, 2007, AEBI entered into a settlement with the DOJ, the Federal Reserve and FinCEN relating to
deficiencies in its AML program. As part of the settlement, AEBI entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DOJ, a Cease and Desist Order with the Federal Reserve and a Consent Order with FinCEN, each of which provides for a money
penalty. The Consent Order with FinCEN also resolves FinCEN&#146;s determination that TRS did not file timely, accurate and complete Suspicious Activity Reports. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company has paid a total of $65 million in settlement of all these matters. Of the amount paid, $60 million is attributable to the matters involving AEBI and $5 million is attributable to the matter involving TRS.
The DOJ assessed a $55 million payment under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. FinCEN assessed a civil money penalty in the amount of $25 million under its Consent Order, $15 million of which is concurrent with the DOJ payment and is therefore
deemed satisfied by the payment made to the DOJ, with the remaining $10 million assessed under the FinCEN Consent Order paid to the Department of the Treasury. The Federal Reserve assessed </FONT>

Agreement, the DOJ filed an information in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida charging AEBI with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. This charge will be
deferred, and absent a breach of the agreement, will be dismissed after 12 months or such earlier time as described in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, and no further prosecution relating to these matters will be brought. The Federal
Reserve&#146;s Cease and Desist Order also requires that AEBI implement certain remedial measures, which are presently underway. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Also on
August&nbsp;6, 2007, AEBL entered into a Written Agreement with the New York State Banking Department, the primary regulator of AEBL, under which AEBL has agreed to implement certain enhancements and remedial measures to its AML compliance program.
There is no monetary fine or penalty associated with this Agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to resolving each of the above proceedings, the Company
has committed to its consolidated supervisor, the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;), that it will complete its efforts to develop and implement an enterprise-wide AML compliance program that will govern compliance throughout the
American Express organization, and will ensure that each of its subsidiaries is provided with resources adequate to meet its legal and regulatory obligations. The Company will report periodically on its progress to the OTS. </FONT></P> <P
