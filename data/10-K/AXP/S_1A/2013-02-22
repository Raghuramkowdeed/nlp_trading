ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED

TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. ONGOING CONCERNS OVER ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT, BUDGET DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON, DECELERATING GROWTH IN CHINA AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES AND MARKETS. THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THE UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAVE HAD, AND

MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS FURTHER. FOR

EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS TO REPLACE EXPENDITURES USING OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL

AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS

LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS

AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF

CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL

ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) WERE TO PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE

CONTINUING OR INCREASED ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

THE

GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON

CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARDMEMBERS AND

MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES. POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS REGARDING BANKING,

MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES INTENDED TO PROMOTE OR MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND/OR STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR

DEMAND. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS HAS IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT CONCERNS REGARDING U.S. DEBT AND BUDGET MATTERS

AND THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE HAVE CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. A FURTHER DOWNGRADE OF U.S. DEBT RATINGS IN THE FUTURE COULD, IN ADDITION TO CAUSING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS, MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, AS WELL AS HAVE OTHER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION. THE IMPACT OF THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE ON FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH OF OUR

DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSIT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN CREDCOS SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND VOLATILITY IN THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY

OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY

OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES) AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR

DEPOSITORS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE.

DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES,

SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL

REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 32-35 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE

INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.

DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR

MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST

OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR

RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME

AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CONTINUED CONCERNS

REGARDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE EURO AS A CURRENCY COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR CAPITAL.

DURING 2012, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE

ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONCERNS PERSIST REGARDING THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE THEIR SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE OVERALL

STABILITY OF THE EURO AND THE SUITABILITY OF THE EURO AS A SINGLE CURRENCY GIVEN THE DIVERSE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN INDIVIDUAL EUROZONE COUNTRIES. THESE CONCERNS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE EURO TO FLUCTUATE MORE WIDELY THAN IN THE

PAST AND COULD LEAD TO THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENCIES IN ONE OR MORE EUROZONE COUNTRIES, OR, IN MORE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POSSIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO CURRENCY ENTIRELY. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATION OF THE EURO AND

WE ARE UNABLE TO HEDGE OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE TO THE EURO, THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED WHEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR INCLUSION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SIMILARLY, THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES OR THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY

CURRENCIES WOULD REQUIRE US TO RECONFIGURE OUR BILLING AND OTHER SYSTEMS TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES IN PLACE OF THE EURO. IMPLEMENTING SUCH CHANGES COULD BE COSTLY AND FAILURES IN THE CURRENCY RECONFIGURATION COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN

OUR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE TO RE-INTRODUCED CURRENCIES MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US.

THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING EUROPE AND THE EURO, OR MARKET PERCEPTIONS CONCERNING THESE AND RELATED ISSUES, COULD CONTINUE TO

HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CONCERNS OVER THE EFFECT OF THIS

FINANCIAL CRISIS ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE COMPANYS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A

MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES, SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE COMPANYS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT

MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN

DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARD

PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE COMPANYS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS

IN ITS MERCHANT CONTRACTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF

THE COMPANY, REQUIRE IT TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS TO STEERING, SELECTIVE ACCEPTANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARDMEMBERS

EXPERIENCE, THREATEN THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND/OR DAMAGE THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF THE COMPANY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS

POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, REQUIRING US TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS,

LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES WE CAN CHARGE FOR

SERVICES, IMPACTING THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, AND INCREASING OUR COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WE ENTER. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS

CONTAINED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE THE COMPANY AND TRS ARE LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND

ACTIVITIES  HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

DODD-FRANK HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CFPB. THE CFPB HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT

AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THE CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

LAWS, AND TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE FOR COMPLIANCE LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IT IS ALSO AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT FINES AND REQUIRE CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE

IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST DATA AND PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS TO THE COMPANY

AND MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT. LIKEWISE, ANY FAILURE TO FOLLOW SUCH REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN RESTITUTION TO CARDMEMBERS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. IN ADDITION TO

INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, CFPB OVERSIGHT HAS RESULTED, AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN CHANGES TO PRICING, PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES AND MAY POTENTIALLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES. SUCH CHANGES COULD

MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. SUCH CHANGES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BRAND AND REPUTATION. SEE 

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS

COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES

 BELOW.

MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS NOT DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTION. THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND

ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT

DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE

ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE MAY BE RESTRICTED IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN CAPITAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS DECLARING DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASING

OUTSTANDING SHARES) OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR BANKING REGULATORS HAVE WIDE DISCRETION IN THE EXAMINATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, AND MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO

ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS, OR MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MORE CAPITAL.

IN ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY RISKS

DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS

ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, REQUIRED TO PAY RESTITUTION, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECTED TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR

SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. REGULATORY ACTION COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND AND ANY CHANGE TO OUR

BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND

UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPOSED, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS,

AFFECT RETENTION OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2009 REQUIRED US TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING,

UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO CARD PRODUCT TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH, AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY, THE CARD ACT; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THE EVENT THE CARD ACT CONSTRAINS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. THE MORE

RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US CAN PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING

IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR COST STRUCTURE.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR

REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

WE MAY ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PRICING, PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES IN RESPONSE TO PENDING OR FUTURE LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF ADDITIONAL REGULATION, INCREASED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE EFFORTS AND ENHANCED

REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN OCTOBER 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS TO RESOLVE REVIEWS OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SIMILAR SETTLEMENTS WERE REACHED WITH SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND TRS. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITIES AGREED TO PAY CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES TOTALING $27.5 MILLION AND WE, THROUGH

OUR SUBSIDIARIES, ESTABLISHED A RESTRICTED FUND POOL TOTALING $85 MILLION FOR CUSTOMER REFUNDS (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE REFUNDS). THE MAJORITY OF THOSE REFUNDS ARE RELATED TO DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES AND LATE

FEE CHARGES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENTS, ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORS AND OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF OUR CARD PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE RESULTED, AND

ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARDMEMBERS AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. FURTHER ACTION BY THE CFPB OR OTHER BANKING REGULATORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

REPUTATIONAL HARM OR FINES, OR MAY PREVENT US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PERMITTED.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THESE RULES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET RULES FOR CAPITAL ADEQUACY

AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED IN FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRANSITION TO BASEL II AND AS A RESULT OF BASEL III AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK. IF THE COMPANY, TRS OR OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE MINIMUM CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR OTHER FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN LIGHT OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS, DODD-FRANK AND BASEL III, THE

COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY ADDITIONAL, MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE FINAL FORM OF, OR THE EFFECTS OF, THESE REGULATIONS. FAILURE

BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND

COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. GUIDANCE

FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE STATES THAT OUR DIVIDEND POLICIES WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY

PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS.

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS

WE SUBMITTED AS DISCUSSED IN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL PLANNING UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE. WHILE THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT, HAD REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS

ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM BOTH THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES AND THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010. MOREOVER, GIVEN THAT THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE DELAYED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES, IT CANNOT BE CERTAIN

WHEN IN THE FINAL RULE AS ADOPTED WILL BE APPLICABLE TO US. CONSEQUENTLY, IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN HOW THE FINAL BASEL III RULES, AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES, WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONALLY, STRESS TESTING

REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR POTENTIALLY EVEN GREATER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, SOONER THAN EXPECTED.

DURING 2012, WE REPURCHASED 69 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 7, 2013, WE

SUBMITTED OUR CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2013. THE PLAN INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE AND CAPITAL AVAILABILITY UNDER CERTAIN ADVERSE ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. WE EXPECT A

RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY MARCH 14, 2013. NO ADDITIONAL SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPURCHASED PRIOR TO ITS RESPONSE. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL SHARE PURCHASES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAW LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE

SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A

PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE DIRECTIVE IS NOW

UNDERGOING REVIEW AND FURTHER CHANGES, AS YET TO BE DEFINED, ARE ANTICIPATED.

ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE

NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED-VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD

NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND MASTERCARD AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,

BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INTERCHANGE FEE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL. IN SOME CASES THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN NETWORK RULES, SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND

HONOR-ALL-CARD PROVISIONS.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD

ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT

HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON THESE NETWORKS. HOWEVER, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING

TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. AMONG OTHER IMPACTS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL

AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM

RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, SO LONG AS SUCH OFFERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.

FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH

MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH

MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS

OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IN EUROPE, SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS

ITALY AND POLAND HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED REGULATION OF INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES. IN JANUARY 2012, THE EC PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION TOWARD POTENTIAL REGULATION) COVERING A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE GREEN PAPER CONTEMPLATES DIRECT REGULATION OF INTERCHANGE FEES AS WELL AS CHANGES TO NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS RULES AND TO REGULATION OF SURCHARGING. OTHER ISSUES COVERED IN THE GREEN PAPER INCLUDE SEPARATION

OF PROCESSING FROM CARD NETWORK MANAGEMENT, PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CROSS-BORDER ACQUIRING, MOBILE PAYMENTS AND TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION. THE EC HAS COMPLETED A CONSULTATION PERIOD AND IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE ITS PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS IN EARLY OF

2013. THESE CONCLUSIONS MAY INVOLVE PROPOSALS FOR REGULATION OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SELF-REGULATION AND COULD TAKE ANOTHER 18-24 MONTHS TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT. SEE 

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 BELOW.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON THE COMPANY, SUCH AS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE

LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE

RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE

NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE

SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARDMEMBERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL SCRUTINY

AND REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, BY RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS, BY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OR BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS,

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION,

COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE,

AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE,

ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION

SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND AFFECT OR LIMIT HOW WE COLLECT AND/OR USE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS APPLICABLE PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THEM.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA IMPOSES CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

SHARE CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR DATA COLLECTION, SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS

THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS); AND REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN

COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE GLBA AND VARIOUS STATE LAWS, SEE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATORY AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND

OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE

VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

IN ADDITION, LEGISLATORS AND/OR REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING OR REVISING PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY-RELATED PRACTICES, OUR COLLECTION, USE, SHARING, RETENTION AND SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, AND SOME OF OUR CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THIS ALSO COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES. THERE IS ALSO INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF DATA PROTECTION, PRIVACY AND/OR INFORMATION SECURITY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, DURING 2012 THE FTC AND THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUED REPORTS PERTAINING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. THE FTCS

REPORT, WHICH APPLIES TO A COMPANYS COLLECTION AND USE OF CONSUMER INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, INDICATES CERTAIN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES THAT AT LEAST ONE KEY U.S. REGULATOR (THE FTC) EXPECTS COMPANIES TO ADHERE TO AS BEST

PRACTICES. THESE INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN (I.E. BUILDING REASONABLE PROTECTIONS INTO DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION, AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES). THE WHITE HOUSE REPORT SETS ADMINISTRATION

POSITIONS, INCLUDING CALLING ON CONGRESS TO ENACT NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL DATA PRACTICES IN THE FORM OF A CONSUMER PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS AND A NATIONAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION STANDARD THAT PREEMPTS THE

EXISTING PATCHWORK OF STATE STANDARDS. IN RECENT YEARS THERE ALSO HAS BEEN INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY THE FTC, AS WELL AS

INCREASED PRIVACY-RELATED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AT THE STATE LEVEL, INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA, SUCH AS WITH REGARD TO MOBILE APPLICATIONS. THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF DRAFT PRIVACY, SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION,

CYBERSECURITY AND

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION-SECURITY RELATED BILLS DURING THE 112TH CONGRESS AND VARIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE HELD ON RELATED SUBJECTS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THESE AREAS AT THE

STATE LEVEL.

IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN

INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS IN MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE

EUROPEAN UNION, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED IN JANUARY 2012 A NEW REGULATION TO REPLACE THE

CURRENT DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WOULD TIGHTEN DATA PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE ENFORCEMENT MORE RIGOROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY STREAMLINING ENFORCEMENT AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL, INTRODUCING DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASING PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. THE PROPOSED REGULATION MAY BE FINALIZED IN LATE 2013 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE 18-24 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THIS PROPOSED REGULATION FOLLOWS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNIONS

E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE, WHICH IMPOSES CONSENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE USE OF COOKIES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES SUCH AS ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISEMENT.

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS (INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION) AFFECTING CUSTOMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE DATA TO WHICH WE ARE

SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY OR PROVIDE CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR ACTIONS, LITIGATION, FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND

OUR BRAND.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY

PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES ABOVE, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL.

THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TAX LEGISLATION INITIATIVES OR CHALLENGES TO OUR TAX

POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE OPERATE IN JURISDICTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND OF VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE PROPOSED, SUCH AS PROPOSALS

FOR FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TAX POSITIONS AND/OR OUR TAX LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AS WELL AS FOREIGN, TAX LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR HISTORICAL TAX POSITIONS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED BY RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES OR THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OUR POSITION IN

CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH CHALLENGE.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS, CASH, CREDIT

AND ACH, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGGREGATORS (E.G., PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT

CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON PURCHASE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. WE BELIEVE VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITIVE CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE VISA AND MASTERCARD NETWORKS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE DOMINANT POSITION, RESOURCES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF VISA AND MASTERCARD.

BECAUSE OF CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS,

THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A

COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG

ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, INCLUDING LARGER CASH RESERVES, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING

AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION, CO-BRAND CARD PROGRAMS OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER

SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS COULD CONTINUE TO BE

IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS

FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL

NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE

WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE

PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH

COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS,

SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP FOCUSES ON THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES. WHILE EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE

COMPANY, MANY OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS FOR THE COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY. OUR FAILURE TO EXPAND ENTERPRISE GROWTH AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGY

AND PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WE OFFER, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE GROWTH. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT

CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. LAWS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS, REQUIRE CARD TRANSACTIONS TO BE ROUTED OVER DOMESTIC NETWORKS OR PROHIBIT OR LIMIT

FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. FURTHER, EXPANDING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS, ADDING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION CHANNELS AND FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS COULD HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN OUR CURRENT

ARRANGEMENTS, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR DILUTE OUR BRAND.

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS

PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT

ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON

HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE, INCLUDING PRESSURE CREATED BY REGULATORY-MANDATED REDUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS PRICING, TO REDUCE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR

TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH IF NOT SUCCESSFUL COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS AND HAVE OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE AND ACTIVATION, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY,

AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WHILE OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING OUR CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS ARE

ENCOURAGED TO WELCOME OUR CARDMEMBERS AND ARE OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS IN OUR AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH SURCHARGING IS SPECIFICALLY

PERMITTED, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS IN CERTAIN MERCHANT CATEGORIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS

GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING. NEW RULES ISSUED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2012 ALLOW US AND OTHER PAYMENT NETWORKS TO PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING BY

MORE THAN THEIR REASONABLE COSTS OF ACCEPTING A PARTICULAR PAYMENT CARD. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN HIGHER SURCHARGES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS WHEN COMPARED TO CARDS ISSUED BY OTHER ISSUERS OR ON OTHER NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT BY MASTERCARD AND VISA OF THEIR U.S. MERCHANT CLASS LITIGATION, WHICH WAS PRELIMINARILY APPROVED IN NOVEMBER 2012, REQUIRES MASTERCARD AND VISA TO PERMIT U.S. MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE MASTERCARD AND VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNDER

CERTAIN TERMS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WHILE PERMITTING THE NETWORKS TO CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGES ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD AND VISA HAVE ANNOUNCED REVISED NETWORK RULES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 27, 2013

THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS THAT ALSO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS FROM IMPLEMENTING SURCHARGES OF MASTERCARD AND/OR VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNLESS THEY ALSO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE

NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY AGREED TO BY MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (I.E., BY SURCHARGING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS BUT NOT SURCHARGING MASTERCARD AND VISA DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS). THIS MAY

ENCOURAGE MERCHANTS THAT CURRENTLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS TO EITHER VIOLATE THEIR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS OR TO DISCONTINUE ACCEPTANCE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IF THIS OCCURS, IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT COVERAGE AND CHARGE VOLUMES.

IF SURCHARGING BECOMES WIDESPREAD, AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND

CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY COULD BECOME LESS DESIRABLE TO CONSUMERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN CARDS IN FORCE AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE IMPACT COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE MANNER IN WHICH A SURCHARGE IS LEVIED AND WHETHER

SURCHARGES ARE LEVIED UPON ALL PAYMENT CARDS, WHETHER DEBIT CARDS ARE EXCLUDED, OR WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE SURCHARGE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CARD, NETWORK, ACQUIRER OR ISSUER. SURCHARGING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT SURCHARGING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE

COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL

OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES,

DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO RETAIN OR CAPTURE A

GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

COST-EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM DROVE AN INCREASE IN THE ULTIMATE REDEMPTION RATE TO 94 PERCENT IN 2012 FROM 92 PERCENT IN 2011, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER REWARDS EXPENSES IN 2012. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS.

IF WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE

FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING PAYMENTS VOLUME, THE AMOUNT OF FEE-BASED SERVICES WE PROVIDE OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW

AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS  EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS  COULD ERODE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND

POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION COULD ALSO RESULT FROM ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OR

CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CARD PRACTICES, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND FROM ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORS OR OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CONDUCT. SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS CAN ALSO CAUSE RAPID, WIDESPREAD

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO OUR BRAND.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE

OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR OR GNS PARTNER THAT ISSUES CARDS AND ACQUIRES MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND

BRAND VALUE. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS A CORPORATION WITH

HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR OTHER POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF

POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, AND INCLUDE.



INCREASING PLASTIC PENETRATION, INCLUDING BY GROWING OUR SHARE OF PREMIUM AND SMALL BUSINESS SPEND AND B2B PAYMENTS



CONTINUING TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH PROPRIETARY AND GNS OFFERINGS



EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE, INCLUDING ONLINE AND MOBILE CHANNELS



SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGING OUR BRAND IN THE PREPAID SPACE



GROWING OUR EXISTING FEE-BASED BUSINESSES SUCH AS INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER SERVICES AND INTRODUCING NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES TO INCREASE FEE

REVENUE

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS

COMPLEX, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN, AND ANY FAILURE BY US TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS ACCURATELY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR MARKET SHARE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO PURSUE A DISCIPLINED EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING

RESTRUCTURING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE VOLATILITY AND REGULATORY

COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL AND RELATED COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR CONTROL, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CURRENT REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS OF INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESSES. THESE

INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE EXPECT OR AT ALL.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.

WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A

NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITIONS OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, AND MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. WE MAY ALSO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES, VALUE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ACCURATELY AND NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, AND

COMPLETE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION OR

INVESTMENT, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION

WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS, AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT, ANALYZE AND RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES. INFORMATION

SECURITY RISKS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEB SITES. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION OF

FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY INCREASE, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTS

THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, MAY BE COMPROMISED.

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO DETECT

AND PREVENT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY

MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA BREACHES, MALICIOUS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FRAUDULENT OR OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN.

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS, MAY EXPERIENCE

SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, SUDDEN INCREASES IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE AND OTHER CYBER ATTACKS,

TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS. SERVICE DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING. INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FRAUD LEVELS OR OTHER

ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION AND REMEDIATION

COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. DATA BREACHES AND OTHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FAILURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY BANKING

REGULATORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY,

THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED

WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCELERATE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS

SUCH AS CO-BRAND PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS: (I) OUR FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, (II) OUR ECONOMIC CONDITION DETERIORATING SUCH THAT OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING IS DOWNGRADED

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY S&P AND MOODYS, (III) OUR CEASING TO HAVE A PUBLIC DEBT RATING, OR (IV) A SHORTFALL IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD

UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY

PROGRAM POINTS THAT MAY NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE

WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.

THERE

CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES (E.G., AMERICAN/US AIRWAY AND UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES), THROUGH MERGERS AND/OR GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND

JOINT VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE.

IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED

ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES, ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS,

INCLUDING JOINTLY PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. THE EC HAS SIMILARLY APPROVED THE ONEWORLD ALLIANCE, AND

ITS REVIEW OF THE OTHER ALLIANCES AND COOPERATION BETWEEN ALLIANCE MEMBERS IS CONTINUING.

INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND

EXPANDED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES INCLUDING REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE BUSINESS. FURTHER CONSOLIDATION MAY ALSO RESULT FROM AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH COULD BE AN OUTCOME OF

AMERICAN AIRLINES PENDING CASE UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION.

SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. OUR LARGEST AIRLINE CO-BRAND LOAN PORTFOLIO, AMERICAN

EXPRESS DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD, ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 15 PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CARDMEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE WITHDRAWAL OF CONTINENTAL

AIRLINES IN 2011 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS

RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 38 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE

ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENSES, AS

WELL AS HOW QUICKLY THEY MAY INCREASE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS, MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR

BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR

OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER-COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET AND MOBILE CHANNELS TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE

REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL

OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR EXPENSES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR PREVIOUSLY

ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL TARGETS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, COMPLIANCE RISK AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 37- 40 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, AS

REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD

SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE

USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR FORECASTING MODELS. IF THE MODELS WE USE TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE INADEQUATE, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR THAT DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY

ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS AND

SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD

PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK,

PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCP CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF

FUTURE LOSSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR

LOAN LOSSES. ALTHOUGH DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED IN 2012, WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICAL LOWS IN THESE RATES AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE. IN ADDITION, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE, THESE RATES MAY INCREASE MORE

THAN EXPECTED. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS THAT

WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES

TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER RESULTING FROM

UNDERESTIMATING THE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE, COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK

REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES

AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET

INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR LIABILITIES AND, IN

PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY; OR WE MAY BE TOO

ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL

 ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL AND

COMPLIANCE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, POOR DATA QUALITY, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

(I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS). OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE

LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS; OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS PROCESSES ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, WE

MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. COMPLIANCE RISK ARISES FROM THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE

RISKS CAN EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS AS WELL AS FINES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES OR PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND CAN LEAD TO DIMINISHED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND DIMINISHED ABILITY TO EXPAND KEY OPERATIONS.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION

AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM

INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $39.7 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. MANY OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT DEPOSIT

RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS

(1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND SUCH

DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES, ALTHOUGH A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2012 WERE ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED

GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA.

AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT

SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE

PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN

AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION.

BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY PHASED IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR

REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF

VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL

TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. WE

ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS

COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR COMMUNICATED OVER

THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS OR PLATFORMS COULD BECOME COMPROMISED. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN

OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY

SERVICE PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, PROCESSORS, AGGREGATORS, GNS PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE DATA QUALITY, COMMUNICATIONS

CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. SEE 

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR

BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

 ABOVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, WEATHER,

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER

CONDITIONS, HEALTH PANDEMICS, INTRUSION INTO OR DEGRADATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED

AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT

INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS CAN RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE OFFER AND, IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL

ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. CARDMEMBER SPENDING MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.
