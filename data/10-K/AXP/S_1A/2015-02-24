RISK FACTORS

THIS

SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR

COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOP INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE

CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR A GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAVE HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER

AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF CARD MEMBERS TO PAY AMOUNTS OWED TO US. IF

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE TO WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE

VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CONSUMER

SPENDING, LOWER DEMAND FOR CREDIT, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS OR LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, SUCH FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS,

CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING AND OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG

OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR

OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

WE

NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL

OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY

SOURCED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING

FACILITIES.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY AND LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN

UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE

FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 43-45 OF OUR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ANY REDUCTION IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY

RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P),

TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS

WELL AS FACTORS NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RESPECTIVE

RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR CAPITAL.

DURING 2014, APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OTHER CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET REVENUES OF $34.3 BILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION AS THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST MANY CURRENCIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, AND WE CURRENTLY EXPECT FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

RESULTS IN 2015.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING OUR NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF

REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES, SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND

CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE

THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT

ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARD PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2015, THE COURT FOUND THAT THE

CHALLENGED PROVISIONS WERE ANTICOMPETITIVE AND WILL NOW DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THE REMEDY WHEN IT ENTERS JUDGMENT IN THE CASE. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF

ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2013, WE AGREED TO SETTLE THESE MERCHANT CLASS ACTIONS AND THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PRELIMINARILY APPROVED BY THE COURT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COURT WILL GRANT FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH CAN BE IMPACTED BY OBJECTIONS TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BY PLAINTIFFS AND

OTHER PARTIES, AS WELL AS BY THE APPEALS PROCESS. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US (INCLUDING AN ADVERSE FINAL JUDGMENT FOLLOWING APPEAL IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION) COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY, REQUIRE US TO

CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE OUR CARD PRODUCTS TO INCREASED STEERING, SELECTIVE ACCEPTANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARD MEMBERS EXPERIENCE, COULD IMPOSE

SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES AND/OR COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUIT

SETTLEMENTS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED

CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND WE MAY BE RESTRICTED IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN CAPITAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS DECLARING DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASING OUTSTANDING SHARES) OR ENGAGE IN

CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR BANKING REGULATORS HAVE WIDE DISCRETION IN THE EXAMINATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, AND MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR

ACQUISITIONS, OR MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MORE CAPITAL.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND

SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, REQUIRED TO PAY

RESTITUTION, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECTED TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION

WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. REGULATORY ACTION COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND AND ANY CHANGE TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO

UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPOSED, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS

(INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION TO PROPOSED LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY

OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF THE U.S. CONGRESS TO CONTINUE THE RENEWAL OF THE ACTIVE FINANCING EXCEPTION TO SUBPART F OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE

IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE

AND REGULATORY REGIMES. THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US CAN PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND NON-U.S. COMPETITORS,

INCLUDING PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR COST STRUCTURE.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MATERIAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED EXPENSES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND/OR

ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS.

BUSINESSES IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION/ANTITRUST LAW, CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AMONG OTHERS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,

PENALTIES AND FINES. THE CONTINUED FOCUS OF MERCHANTS ON THE COSTS OF ACCEPTING VARIOUS FORMS OF PAYMENT MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS. GIVEN THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, AND THE VERY LARGE OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES SOUGHT IN SOME MATTERS ASSERTED AGAINST US, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY WE MAY INCUR FROM LITIGATION MATTERS. THE FINDING, OR EVEN THE ASSERTION, OF SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY AGAINST US COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS US, HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY SCRUTINY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH HAS INCREASINGLY LED TO PUBLIC ENFORCEMENTS ACTIONS. THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS BY THE CFPB AND OTHER REGULATORS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE

WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. RECENTLY, SEVERAL LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ANNOUNCED WELL-PUBLICIZED PUBLIC SETTLEMENTS OF REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY LARGER IN SIZE THAN THOSE SEEN HISTORICALLY. THE RECENT TREND

TOWARDS LARGER SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS COULD LEAD TO A MORE ADVERSE

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUTCOME FOR A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INVOLVED IN AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT THAT REGULATORS WILL CONTINUE TAKING FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

ADDITION TO ADDRESSING SUPERVISORY CONCERNS THROUGH NON-PUBLIC SUPERVISORY ACTIONS OR FINDINGS, WHICH COULD INVOLVE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF ADDITIONAL REGULATION, ENHANCED COMPLIANCE EFFORTS AND INCREASED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT IS

LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN CHANGES TO PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION, AND ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARD MEMBERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS GENERALLY

COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, INCREASED EXPENSES, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THESE RULES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET RULES FOR CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT

COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. FAILURE BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD

OF TIME, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS.

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN

SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERNATIONAL BASEL III FRAMEWORK AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING PHASED-IN. ONCE THESE REVISIONS ARE FULLY PHASED-IN, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY MORE

STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE ESTIMATE THAT, HAD BASEL III BEEN FULLY PHASED-IN DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE U.S. BASEL CAPITAL III RULES WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. AS PART OF OUR REQUIRED STRESS TESTING, BOTH INTERNALLY AND BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL STANDARDS IN THE ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE

ECONOMIC SCENARIOS PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE EACH YEAR. TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO HOLD ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THAT REQUIRED BY THE NEW CAPITAL RULES AS THEY ARE PHASED-IN.

IN ADDITION TO THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS OR POTENTIAL PROPOSALS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE REGULATORY

CAPITAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A FRAMEWORK FOR D-SIBS THAT WOULD IMPOSE A

CAPITAL BUFFER ON CERTAIN BANKS THAT HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMIES. WHILE THE NEW CAPITAL RULES DID NOT ADDRESS THE ADOPTION OF A SURCHARGE ON D-SIBS, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS NOTED THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING A CAPITAL

SURCHARGE FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, OR SOME SUBSET OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES SURCHARGE PROPOSALS.

SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY, AEBFSB AND CENTURION BANK ARE SUBJECT TO NEW LIQUIDITY RULES, INCLUDING THE BASEL III-BASED LCR, FOCUSED ON A

30-DAY HORIZON, AND COMPLEMENTARY LIQUIDITY RULES UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACTS ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR INSTITUTIONS HAVING $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED THE NSFR AS A

LIQUIDITY MEASURE, FOCUSED ON A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON, FOR INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKS. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES IMPLEMENTING THE NSFR IN THE UNITED STATES.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCORDINGLY, THERE CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF

THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGIME THAT WILL APPLY TO US AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, AND, AS A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THESE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND THE RESULTS OF OUR

OPERATIONS.

WHILE WE EXPECT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES (INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER)

AND THE LCR, EACH AS PHASED-IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO LEND, GROW DEPOSIT BALANCES, MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF INCREASED DIVIDENDS OR SHARE

REPURCHASES. HIGHER CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET LEVELS COULD ALSO LOWER OUR RETURN ON EQUITY. FAILURE TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, THE LCR OR BY REGULATORS IN

IMPLEMENTING OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

COMPLIANCE

WITH CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES, INCLUDING THE NEW CAPITAL RULES AND THE LCR, WILL REQUIRE A MATERIAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF RISK WEIGHT CALCULATIONS UNDER THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH, WE

CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES WILL BE CORRECT AND WE MAY NEED TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REGULATORY CAPITAL THAN WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A GIVEN CAPITAL RATIO. AN INABILITY TO MEET REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS REGARDING

OUR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY

AND LIQUIDITY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY

DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK. OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE CAPITAL STOCK BY OUR REGULATORS WHO HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT ANY

ACTION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE

EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

AND REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS ARE ASSESSED AGAINST OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF

A STRESSED MARKET ENVIRONMENT. IF OUR CAPITAL PLAN IS NOT APPROVED FOR ANY REASON OR IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE CAPITAL ACTIONS MAY BE RESTRICTED. A FAILURE TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS ALONG WITH OUR

COMPETITORS, OR ANY REDUCTION OF, OR ELIMINATION OF, OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WOULD LIKELY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS.

OUR ABILITY TO DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON, OR PURCHASE, REDEEM OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE PROHIBITED,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO NOT DECLARE AND PAY IN FULL DIVIDENDS FOR THE LAST PRECEDING DIVIDEND PERIOD OF OUR SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAW LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. IN

PARTICULAR, OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATUTORY AND REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON THEIR DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY COULD BE REDUCED TO THE EXTENT OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE

UNABLE TO DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE COMPANY WHEN NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK, MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS

OUTSTANDING DEBT OR MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION

VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN

THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS EVOLVED AND INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK

SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY

OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CUSTOMERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CARDS. ACTIVITY SUCH AS MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING INVOLVING OUR CARDS COULD RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT

ACTION, AND OUR REPUTATION MAY SUFFER DUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES, PERSONS OR ENTITIES OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT

SERVICES DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES THAT PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE

DIRECTIVE IS NOW UNDERGOING REVIEW AND FURTHER CHANGES, AS YET TO BE DEFINED, ARE ANTICIPATED. COMPLYING WITH THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCREASES OUR COSTS AND CAN REDUCE OUR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES.

VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

GUIDELINES, CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO

ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF

CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED-VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD ARE AWARE OF EACH OTHERS APPROACHES TO THE REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

CONSEQUENTLY, A DEVELOPMENT IN ONE COUNTRY, STATE OR REGION MAY INFLUENCE REGULATORY APPROACHES IN ANOTHER. IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING

INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS IN PAYMENT NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS, AS WELL AS THE TERMS FOR MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE, INCLUDING TERMS RELATING TO NON-DISCRIMINATION AND

HONOR-ALL-CARDS. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EU (E.G., POLAND, HUNGARY, SPAIN) HAVE ENACTED LOCAL REGULATION ON INTERCHANGE FEES. THE EU ITSELF MOVED SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARD FINALIZING EU-WIDE REGULATION IN 2014 THAT WOULD CAP INTERCHANGE

FEES AND REGULATE SEVERAL OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN MEXICO, THE GOVERNMENT PASSED PAYMENT NETWORK LAWS THAT GIVE THE CENTRAL BANK AND NATIONAL BANKING COMMISSION, ACTING TOGETHER, THE POWER TO ISSUE

REGULATIONS ABOUT PAYMENT SYSTEMS INCLUDING INTERCHANGE AND OTHER FEES. IN MALAYSIA, THE NATIONAL BANK HAS ISSUED RULES ON THE REGULATION OF INTERCHANGE FEES AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO CARD ACCEPTANCE. IN SOME CASES SUCH REGULATION EXTENDS TO

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, FOR EXAMPLE, FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH GNS PARTNERS OR TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN CANADA, HUNGARY, ITALY, POLAND, SWITZERLAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EU, AMONG OTHERS,

HAVE CONDUCTED ANTITRUST-RELATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO, OR INITIATED PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO, MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES THAT ARE ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL. IN SOME CASES THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN NETWORK PRACTICES, SUCH

AS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARD PROVISIONS.

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE

CARD ISSUING BANK IN CERTAIN PAYMENT NETWORKS, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH

INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON THESE NETWORKS. HOWEVER, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO

MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. AMONG OTHER IMPACTS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS

TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING

MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, SO LONG AS OFFERS TO ENCOURAGE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS

OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS

U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE

ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED BY MERCHANTS SEEKING TO OVERTURN SOME OF THE EXISTING STATE LAWS IN THE UNITED

STATES BANNING CREDIT CARD SURCHARGES.

IN THE EU, NEW, SWEEPING REGULATORY CHANGES IN THE CARD PAYMENT SECTOR, INCLUDING THE

INTRODUCTION OF PRICE REGULATION, THE ELIMINATION OF HONOR-ALL-CARDS AND ANTI-STEERING RULES, AND REQUIREMENTS ON GRANTING ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK, AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES, MOVED FORWARD SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2014 AND ARE NOW NEARLY

FINAL. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OF THE PROPOSALS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON US, SEE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION ABOVE. THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL OR PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY TO COMPETE WITH THE MORE ENTRENCHED BANKCARD NETWORKS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR BUSINESS IN THE EU AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM ANTICIPATED

DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. WE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO CARD ACCEPTANCE BY MERCHANTS, AND ALTER OUR

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE EU, INCLUDING ARRANGEMENTS WITH GNS PARTNERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CARDS-IN-FORCE AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT

ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE IMPACT OF THE EVOLVING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING FINAL IMPLEMENTING

REGULATIONS, GUIDANCE AND INTERPRETATIONS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUPERVISORY ACTIONS AND PRIORITIES, THE ACTIONS OF OUR COMPETITORS AND OTHER MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF CONSUMERS. THE EVOLVING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MAY INCREASE

OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS COULD

ALSO REQUIRE US TO LIMIT OR CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LIMIT FEES WE CAN CHARGE FOR SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OR TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE

SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR

MAINTAINING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARD MEMBERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL SCRUTINY AND REQUIREMENTS WITH

RESPECT TO DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD PARTIES,

INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, BY RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARD MEMBERS OR MERCHANTS, BY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR

SYSTEMS OR BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND

COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT

REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE

AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND AFFECT OR LIMIT HOW WE COLLECT AND/OR USE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SECURITY

BREACH NOTIFICATION, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA

IMPOSES CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SHARE CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR

DATA COLLECTION, SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS); AND

REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE GLBA AND VARIOUS STATE LAWS, SEE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION UNDER SUPERVISION

AND REGULATION ABOVE.

IN THE EU, THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER AND/OR

PROCESSOR OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS IN MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED

THROUGHOUT THE EU, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS, STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED DATA

SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATORY AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA

PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION.

RECENT ACCOUNT DATA COMPROMISE EVENTS AT LARGE RETAILERS, AS WELL

AS THE DISCLOSURE OF THE MONITORING ACTIVITIES BY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, HAVE RESULTED IN HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY AROUND THE WORLD. LEGISLATORS AND/OR REGULATORS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING OR REVISING PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND

INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED PRACTICES, OUR COLLECTION, USE, SHARING, RETENTION AND SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, AND SOME OF OUR CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS

OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MOREOVER, THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING LAWS TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE UNCERTAIN, INCREASING COMPLIANCE RISK.

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT AFFECTING CUSTOMER

AND/OR EMPLOYEE DATA COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY OR PROVIDE CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR ACTIONS, LITIGATION, FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR

MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE

MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES ABOVE, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC OR OTHER

REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF KEY

PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TAX AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES OR ASSESSMENTS BY

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE OPERATE IN

JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS SUCH, WE REMIT A VARIETY OF TAXES AND FEES TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE TAXES AND FEES REMITTED BY US ARE

SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND AUDIT BY THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO UNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY (ESCHEAT) LAWS THAT REQUIRE US TO TURN OVER TO CERTAIN

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS HELD

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY US (SUCH AS UNCASHED STORED-VALUE PRODUCTS LIKE TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS) THAT HAS BEEN UNCLAIMED FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO TAX

AND UNCLAIMED PROPERTY MATTERS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR POSITIONS ARE REASONABLE, VARIOUS AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE OUR POSITIONS OR APPLY EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MORE

BROADLY, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIABILITIES FOR TAXES, UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AND INTEREST IN EXCESS OF ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE PROPOSED FROM TIME TO TIME, SUCH AS PROPOSALS FOR FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES OR MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS BASE EROSION AND PROFIT

SHIFTING BY MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TAX POSITIONS AND/OR OUR TAX LIABILITIES. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED, AND IN SOME STATES ENACTED, TO ESTABLISH SHORTER ESCHEATMENT

PERIODS FOR TRAVELERS CHECKS AND/OR PREPAID CARDS, OFTEN WITH RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. WE HAVE CHALLENGED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE, WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN THESE LAWS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS BUSINESS IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE ENACTED, AS WELL AS INCREASE THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO UNCASHED STORED-VALUE PRODUCTS.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR

OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS, PAPER-BASED TRANSACTIONS (E.G.,

CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND ACH), AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS AND WEB-BASED PAYMENT PLATFORMS (E.G., PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS PAYMENT

TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), DIGITAL CURRENCIES, PREPAID SYSTEMS, GIFT CARDS AND OTHER SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS.

WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON PURCHASE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. WE BELIEVE VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST

COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, COMPETITIVE CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE VISA AND MASTERCARD NETWORKS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE DOMINANT POSITION, SCALE, RESOURCES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF VISA AND MASTERCARD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING

PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY

GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, INCLUDING LARGER CASH RESERVES, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING, MARKETING OR CROSS-SELLING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND

RECOGNITION, COBRAND CARD PROGRAMS OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. OUR

COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAN WE ARE.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND CORPORATE

PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES SUCH AS PREPAID SERVICES.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING CONTINUING

ADVANCEMENTS IN THE AREAS OF PROXIMITY PAYMENT DEVICES (SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS) AND REMOTE PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (SUCH AS CLOUD-BASED ACCOUNTS), AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND

TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE, TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH

CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO INNOVATE FASTER THAN WE CAN, AND NEW

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TECHNOLOGIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BY ENABLING OUR COMPETITORS TO OFFER MORE EFFICIENT OR LOWER-COST SERVICES. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP

NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP PACE WITH INNOVATION, MANAGE THE SHIFT TO MOBILE, DEVICE-BASED AND MULTI-CHANNEL COMMERCE OR IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE CARD

MEMBER EXPERIENCE, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND PREPAID

ACCOUNTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE

AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPANIES THAT MARKET OPEN-LOOP PREPAID DEBIT CARDS THROUGH RETAIL AND ONLINE DISTRIBUTION, BANKS AND OTHER

PROVIDERS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT AND SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, OTHER ISSUERS OF DEBIT CARDS, CHECK CASHERS, MONEY ORDER SERVICES, AND LARGE RETAILERS OR RETAILER COALITIONS WHO ARE SEEKING TO INTEGRATE MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INTO THEIR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS. WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED COMPETITION FROM TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS THAT ARE OFTEN WELL-POSITIONED TO SERVICE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED OR POORLY SERVED BY THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL

SYSTEM, AND THAT MAY WISH TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN PREPAID CARD PROGRAMS. THE INCREASED DESIRE OF BANKS, RETAILERS AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE PREPAID CARD PROGRAMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PREPAID

OFFERINGS, SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR

COMPETITORS, DRIVE VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND/OR EFFECTIVELY GROW IN AREAS SUCH AS MOBILE AND ONLINE PAYMENTS, FEE-BASED SERVICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. MANY OF OUR GROWTH

INITIATIVES INVOLVE NEW AREAS FOR US AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY. OUR FAILURE TO DRIVE ADOPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGY AND PAYMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS THE PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE

OFFER THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW

BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. WE MAY

FACE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND WE MAY NEED TO DEDICATE MORE EXPENSE, TIME AND RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAN OUR COMPETITORS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE

NOT REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES THAT CONTROL ACCESS TO CONSUMER AND MERCHANT PAYMENT METHOD PREFERENCES THROUGH DIGITAL WALLETS, MOBILE APPLICATIONS OR AT THE POINT OF SALE COULD CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT OR COULD SUPPRESS

USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR COULD RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACTION DATA. SUCH COMPANIES COULD ALSO REQUIRE PAYMENTS FROM US TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH DIGITAL WALLETS AND APPLICATIONS, IMPACTING OUR PROFITABILITY ON TRANSACTIONS. LAWS AND

BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS, REQUIRE CARD TRANSACTIONS TO BE ROUTED OVER DOMESTIC NETWORKS OR PROHIBIT OR LIMIT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. FURTHER, EXPANDING OUR

SERVICE OFFERINGS, ADDING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION CHANNELS AND FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS COULD HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN OUR CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR DILUTE OUR BRAND.

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, AS WELL AS THE OUTCOMES OF

LITIGATION, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE CONTINUED INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT

ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH

REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARD MEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS GENERALLY FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARD MEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR

NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. WE HAVE BEEN UNDER INCREASING MARKET PRESSURE, INCLUDING PRESSURE CREATED BY REGULATORY-MANDATED REDUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS PRICING, TO REDUCE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. WE ALSO FACE PRESSURE FROM COMPETITORS THAT HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME OR LOWER EXPENSE BASES THAT CAN MAKE THEIR PRICING MORE ATTRACTIVE TO KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS.

MERCHANTS ARE ALSO ABLE TO NEGOTIATE INCENTIVES AND PRICING CONCESSIONS FROM US AS A CONDITION TO ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. AS MERCHANTS CONSOLIDATE AND BECOME EVEN LARGER, WE MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVES AND/OR CONCESSIONS WE PROVIDE TO

CERTAIN MERCHANTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY PRESSURES ON PRICING COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF THESE INCENTIVES.

IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND

LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. SOME MERCHANTS ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN PAYMENT SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS CURRENTC ON THE MERCHANT CUSTOMER EXCHANGE,

USING BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEW TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. IF MERCHANTS ARE ABLE TO DRIVE BROAD CONSUMER ADOPTION AND USAGE, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE AND BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES.

A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH, IF NOT SUCCESSFUL, COULD NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES, INCREASING OTHER SOURCES

OF REVENUE, SUCH AS FEE-BASED REVENUE OR INTEREST INCOME, OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN SUSTAINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES OR OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS.

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES.

THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE EU THAT PERMIT SURCHARGING COULD INCREASE AS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEET WITH THE COMMISSION TO FINALIZE CHANGES TO EU LAW ON SURCHARGING, AS DISCUSSED IN GLOBAL NETWORK &

MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION ABOVE. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL FORM, OR EFFECTS ON US, OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS IN CERTAIN

MERCHANT CATEGORIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING.

IN DECEMBER 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF U.S. MERCHANT CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS UNDER WHICH WE WOULD CHANGE OUR U.S. CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS TO PERMIT MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS NO MORE THAN THE SURCHARGE ON OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT THE MERCHANT ACCEPTS (OTHER THAN CASH, CHECKS, DEBIT CARDS OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS). WHILE WE CONTINUE TO

BELIEVE SURCHARGING IS NOT A CUSTOMER-FRIENDLY PRACTICE, THIS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDES MERCHANTS WITH ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS, EVEN IF THE

MERCHANT DOES NOT SURCHARGE DEBIT CARDS. WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PUT THESE CONTRACT CHANGES INTO EFFECT ANY SOONER THAN THE DATE THAT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECEIVES FINAL APPROVAL, INCLUDING ANY APPEAL PERIOD. IF THE SETTLEMENT RECEIVES FINAL APPROVAL, THESE CONTRACT CHANGES, COMBINED WITH U.S. MERCHANTS OPTIONS UNDER DODD-FRANK TO OFFER

DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO INDUCE PAYMENT BY DEBIT CARDS, COULD SHIFT SPENDING FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO DEBIT CARDS. FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

IF SURCHARGING BECOMES WIDESPREAD, AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY COULD BECOME LESS DESIRABLE TO CONSUMERS,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN CARDS-IN-FORCE AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE IMPACT COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE MANNER IN WHICH A SURCHARGE IS LEVIED AND WHETHER SURCHARGES ARE LEVIED UPON ALL PAYMENT CARDS, WHETHER DEBIT CARDS ARE EXCLUDED, OR

WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE SURCHARGE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CARD, NETWORK, ACQUIRER OR ISSUER. SURCHARGING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT SURCHARGING

DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD MEMBERS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR

MARKETING, PROMOTION, MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARD MEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND

PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION OF MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS. IF THE RATE OF MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE GROWTH SLOWS OR REVERSES ITSELF, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

ONE

OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS, REDUCE CARD MEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO RETAIN OR CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARD MEMBER BENEFITS. ANY

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN, OR FAILURE BY MANAGEMENT TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE, ACTUAL REDEMPTIONS OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AND ASSOCIATED REDEMPTION COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST-EFFECTIVELY

MANAGE AND EXPAND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES.

OUR PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE BY OFFERING NEW PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR NEW OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT VALUE, THEY MAY FAIL TO

ACCEPT OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING REVENUES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND COBRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS

AND SERVICES THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN OURS.

IF WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND

REWARDS PROGRAMS, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING PAYMENTS VOLUME, INCREASING OTHER AREAS OF REVENUES SUCH AS FEE-BASED REVENUES OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE

MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF OURS, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE,

TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES, MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS  EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS  COULD ERODE TRUST

AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARD

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION COULD ALSO RESULT FROM ACTUAL OR

ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CARD PRACTICES, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND FROM ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORS OR OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CONDUCT. SOCIAL

MEDIA CHANNELS CAN ALSO CAUSE RAPID, WIDESPREAD REPUTATIONAL HARM TO OUR BRAND.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED

BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR OR GNS PARTNER THAT ISSUES CARDS OR ACQUIRES MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARD MEMBERS AND

MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND VALUE. THE LACK OF ACCEPTANCE OR SUPPRESSION OF CARD USAGE BY MERCHANTS CAN ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT PERCEPTIONS OF OUR BRAND AND OUR PRODUCTS, LOWER OVERALL TRANSACTION VOLUME AND INCREASE THE

ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHER PAYMENTS SYSTEMS. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS

A CORPORATION WITH HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR OTHER POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR

DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, AND INCLUDE.



INCREASING PENETRATION IN PAYMENTS AND MERCHANT COVERAGE



CONTINUING TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH PROPRIETARY AND GNS OFFERINGS



EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE, INCLUDING ONLINE AND MOBILE CHANNELS



GROWING OUR LOYALTY COALITION BUSINESS, LOYALTY PARTNER, AND OUR NEWER PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVE AND BLUEBIRD

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS

COMPLEX, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN, AND ANY FAILURE BY US TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS ACCURATELY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR MARKET SHARE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY UNDERESTIMATE THE

TIME AND EXPENSE WE MUST INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BEFORE THEY GENERATE MATERIAL REVENUES, IF AT ALL.

WE ALSO

CONTINUE TO PURSUE A DISCIPLINED EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING REENGINEERING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN OUR FOREIGN

ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE VOLATILITY. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL AND RELATED COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR CONTROL GIVEN THE CURRENT REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT. AS CYBERSECURITY THREATS CONTINUE TO

EVOLVE, WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO MODIFY OR STRENGTHEN OUR PROTECTIVE SECURITY MEASURES, INVESTIGATE AND REMEDIATE ANY VULNERABILITIES OF OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE OR INVEST IN

NEW TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO MITIGATE SECURITY RISKS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR EXPENSES, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. MOREOVER, WE HAVE INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS OF INVESTING IN OUR

BUSINESSES. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE EXPECT OR AT ALL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN

INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND PREPAID

PRODUCTS, AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT, ANALYZE AND RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISKS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR

CATEGORIES OF THREAT ACTORS THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE POSE THE GREATEST RISK, NAMELY CYBER CRIMINALS, NATION STATE SPONSORED GROUPS, DETERMINED INSIDERS AND HACKTIVISTS OR SOCIAL OBJECTORS. THESE THREAT ACTORS ARE USING

INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARD MEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT, TO DISRUPT INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEBSITES. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION OF FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY INCREASE, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES

INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, MAY BE COMPROMISED, WHICH COULD

LEAD TO UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS ON OUR CARDS.

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO DETECT AND PREVENT DATA

BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE

SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA BREACHES, MALICIOUS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FRAUDULENT OR OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN, INCLUDING THE UNAUTHORIZED

DISCLOSURE, RELEASE, GATHERING, MONITORING, MISUSE, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND OTHER INFORMATION (INCLUDING ACCOUNT DATA INFORMATION).

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS, MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, SUDDEN

INCREASES IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE AND OTHER CYBER-ATTACKS, TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE AND OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN THE TARGETS OF DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM SOPHISTICATED THIRD PARTIES. SERVICE DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION,

COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE

COUNTRIES.

IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED

FRAUD LEVELS OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE DUE TO A DATA BREACH AT A BUSINESS PARTNER, MERCHANT OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS

MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION AND REMEDIATION COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE

THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS OR BREACHES ARE NOT DETECTED IMMEDIATELY, THEIR EFFECT COULD BE COMPOUNDED. DATA BREACHES AND OTHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FAILURES TO MAINTAIN

CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY BANKING REGULATORS.

SUCCESSFUL CYBER-ATTACKS OR DATA BREACHES AT OTHER LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LARGE RETAILERS OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE IMPACTED, COULD LEAD TO A GENERAL LOSS OF CUSTOMER

CONFIDENCE THAT COULD

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEGATIVELY AFFECT US, INCLUDING HARMING THE MARKET PERCEPTION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN GENERAL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED USE OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST SOME CYBER-RISKS AND ATTACKS, IT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF A MATERIAL LOSS EVENT.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE BUSINESS PARTNERS, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS. WE ALSO FACE SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION FOR PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OR

RENEGOTIATION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS GLOBALLY, TO OFFER COBRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN

MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARD MEMBER PARTICIPANTS. OUR COBRAND PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 25 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND LESS THAN 50

PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE CARD MEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE VOLUME OF BILLED BUSINESS AND CARD MEMBER LOANS GENERATED BY OUR COBRAND PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE

COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE THAT, UPON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION, THE COBRAND PARTNER MAY PURCHASE OR DESIGNATE A THIRD PARTY TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES GENERATED WITH RESPECT TO ITS PROGRAM, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS OUTSTANDING.

COMPETITION FOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY BUSINESS

PARTNERS IS VERY INTENSE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW OR MAINTAIN THESE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS. ESTABLISHING AND RETAINING ATTRACTIVE COBRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS AS

THESE PARTNERSHIPS TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CUSTOMERS. WE FACE THE RISK THAT WE COULD LOSE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, EVEN AFTER WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, TIME AND EXPENSE IN ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING THE RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN CARD MEMBER ATTRITION OR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO RETAIN CARD MEMBERS. WE ALSO FACE THE RISK THAT EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE RENEGOTIATED WITH LESS FAVORABLE TERMS FOR US AS COMPETITION FOR SUCH RELATIONSHIPS INCREASES. THE LOSS OF

BUSINESS PARTNERS (WHETHER BY NON-RENEWAL AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD OR EARLY TERMINATION) OR THE RENEGOTIATION OF EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH TERMS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE FOR US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT OUR U.S. COBRAND RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO, ONE OF OUR TWO LARGEST COBRAND RELATIONSHIPS, IS SET TO END ON MARCH 31, 2016. FOR A DISCUSSION ON COSTCO AND OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING

THE IMPACT, SEE PAGES 20-21 OF OUR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. WE WERE ALSO UNABLE TO REACH TERMS TO RENEW OUR COBRAND RELATIONSHIPS WITH COSTCO IN CANADA AND JETBLUE RECENTLY. IN

ADDITION, ANY PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, AND COULD LESSEN OUR NEGOTIATING POWER WITH OUR REMAINING AND

PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCELERATE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS

COBRAND PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS: (I) OUR FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, (II) OUR ECONOMIC CONDITION DETERIORATING SUCH THAT OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING IS DOWNGRADED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW

INVESTMENT GRADE BY S&P AND MOODYS, (III) OUR CEASING TO HAVE A PUBLIC DEBT RATING, OR (IV) A SHORTFALL IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE

TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN COBRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY PROGRAM POINTS THAT MAY

NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO

REIMBURSE CARD MEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, WHICH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS IN THE PAST. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014. WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY TO THE EXTENT WE PROTECT CARD MEMBERS AGAINST NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS

WHERE WE HAVE REMITTED PAYMENT TO AN AIRLINE FOR A CARD MEMBER PURCHASE OF TICKETS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN USED OR FLOWN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE AIRLINE, WE WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED TO THE CARD

MEMBER.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A

PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR COBRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN

AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING COBRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH COBRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. OUR LARGEST AIRLINE COBRAND PORTFOLIO, AMERICAN EXPRESS DELTA SKYMILES, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT OF OUR

WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CARD MEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR OTHER BENEFITS PROGRAMS OFFERED TO CARD MEMBERS, CHANGE THE TERMS UNDER WHICH IT PARTICIPATES IN THESE PROGRAMS OR CEASE PARTICIPATING AS AN

AMERICAN EXPRESS COBRAND PARTNER, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN AIRLINES IN 2014 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARD MEMBERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK  EXPOSURE TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 52 OF OUR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, ASSET LIABILITY RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, COMPLIANCE RISK, MODEL RISK AND REPUTATIONAL

RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 50-55 OF OUR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT

BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. THERE MAY ALSO BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR THAT DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED. AS REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR FORECASTING MODELS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A GOVERNANCE

FRAMEWORK FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND INDEPENDENT MODEL VALIDATION, THE MODELING METHODOLOGY COULD BE ERRONEOUS OR THE MODELS COULD BE MISUSED. IF OUR DECISIONS ARE BASED ON INCORRECT OR MISUSED MODEL OUTPUTS AND REPORTS, WE MAY FACE ADVERSE

CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS FINANCIAL LOSS, POOR BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING, OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, SOME DECISIONS OUR REGULATORS MAKE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION PLANS, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF

THEY PERCEIVE THE QUALITY OF OUR MODELS TO BE INSUFFICIENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT

WITH GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT AND CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES, DELINQUENCIES AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM

CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS, GCP CLIENTS AND TREASURY AND INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT

RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE LOSSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE

US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. ALTHOUGH DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED IN 2014, WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICAL LOWS IN THESE RATES AND THEY WILL BE INCREASING OVER TIME. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR

RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD

HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO

OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES

AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION

WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL OR REGULATORY CHANGES (SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY LAWS AND MINIMUM PAYMENT REGULATIONS). INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER

RESULTING FROM UNDERESTIMATING THE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN OUR MIX OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE, COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET AND

ASSET-LIABILITY RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE EXPOSED TO

MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS

INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, A HYPOTHETICAL 1.0 PERCENT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE

TO OUR ANNUAL NET INTEREST INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $212 MILLION.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR LIABILITIES AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY

OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY; OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY

EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL



ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED.

WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, POOR DATA QUALITY, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS). OPERATIONAL RISK

INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS; OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS PROCESSES ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, WE MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW

OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. COMPLIANCE RISK ARISES FROM THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS CAN EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS

AS WELL AS FINES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES OR PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND CAN LEAD TO DIMINISHED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND DIMINISHED ABILITY TO EXPAND KEY OPERATIONS.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENSES, AS WELL AS HOW QUICKLY THEY MAY INCREASE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY BE

NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS, MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS

(INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE-TO-REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME.

THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO INTERNET AND MOBILE CHANNELS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN

A TIMELY MANNER OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OR COMPLIANCE AND CONTROL PROCESSES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE OR CAPITALIZE ON

THESE BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR EXPENSES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL TARGETS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY,

AND OUR BUSINESS AND REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE HAVE ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

ACQUISITIONS OF REVOLUTION MONEY, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, AND MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. WE MAY ALSO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES, VALUE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ACCURATELY AND NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, AND COMPLETE PROPOSED

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION OR INVESTMENT, INCUR

UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

AS DISCUSSED UNDER GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES ABOVE,

WE CREATED A NEW JOINT VENTURE FOR OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL OPERATIONS IN 2014. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING ACCELERATING THE

TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH OF THE CORPORATE TRAVEL BUSINESS, CREATING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND ENHANCING ITS SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE AND THE GBT JV FACE THE RISK OF POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS

PARTNERS AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION. OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS OR OTHER PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTION,

INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

JOINT VENTURES AND MINORITY INVESTMENTS INHERENTLY

INVOLVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE FINANCIAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND/OR COMPLIANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE JOINT VENTURE OR MINORITY INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE DEPENDENT ON JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT WHO MAY HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS, STRATEGIES OR GOALS

THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OURS. BUSINESS DECISIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE PARTNER, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT, RESULT IN LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION

AGAINST US AND OTHERWISE DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS

DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $43.3 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE

NETWORKS. AGGRESSIVE PRICING THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETENTION OF EXISTING BALANCES AND THE COST-EFFICIENT ACQUISITION OF NEW DEPOSIT FUNDS, AND MAY AFFECT OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER

INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. CUSTOMERS COULD CLOSE THEIR ACCOUNTS OR REDUCE BALANCES OR DEPOSITS IN FAVOR OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY COMPETITORS FOR OTHER REASONS. THESE

SHIFTS, WHICH COULD BE RAPID, COULD RESULT FROM GENERAL DISSATISFACTION WITH OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, INCLUDING CONCERNS OVER PRICING, ONLINE SECURITY OR OUR REPUTATION.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS

(1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS

ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE

NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR

AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH

INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION

WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN UNSAFE

OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL-CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS

IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. THE

NEW CAPITAL RULES, WHEN FULLY PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE

WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO

THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A

SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR COMMUNICATED OVER THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS OR PLATFORMS COULD BECOME COMPROMISED, WHICH

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS EVEN IF THE ATTACK OR BREACH DOES NOT IMPACT OUR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE

COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, PROCESSORS, AGGREGATORS, GNS PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR THE

TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY FAILS TO PROVIDE THE DATA QUALITY, COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL

DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OR COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. SEE 

A

SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN

FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS

 ABOVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER

CONDITIONS.

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, HEALTH PANDEMICS,

INTRUSION INTO OR DEGRADATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION

OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS CAN RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE OFFER AND, IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CARD

MEMBER SPENDING MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
