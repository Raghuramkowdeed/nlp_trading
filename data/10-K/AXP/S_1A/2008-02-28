ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS

THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE

THAT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY

KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE

EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF

SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS. WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE

LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS. AS A RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING POWER OF VISA AND MASTERCARD. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY

CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP,

SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE

OR PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.

37

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS

WHO ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH

REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE

TO THE REGULATORY PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM MERCHANT DISCOUNT

RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER

BENEFITS INTENDED TO STIMULATE SUCH USE.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING

CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND

ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE, AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF

CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER

BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE

INSTITUTED REWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE REWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING OR IN

MANAGING THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION

ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS

ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE

PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO

OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

AN

INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY

SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A

MORE ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO

REGULATORY INTERVENTION

38

(SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT TRENDS IN CONSUMER

SPENDING AND IN TRAVEL.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF SPENDING USING OUR CREDIT AND

CHARGE CARDS, AND WE ARE NOT INSULATED FROM THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES. A SUSTAINED DETERIORATION IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE, OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES IN KEY COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE,

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OR AVERAGE PURCHASE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND RESULT IN INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES. POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN

CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD

GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE

CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE,

INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS MAY DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT

SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DOWNTURNS IN THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND CONSOLIDATIONS OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE

POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH

BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED

TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY

HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR

IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANY INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AND SOME CARRIERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IN 2008, PARTICULARLY IN

THE UNITED STATES. WE WOULD NOT EXPECT CONSOLIDATION TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES. HOWEVER, AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A

PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN

AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF A SURVIVING AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS

39

CO-BRAND CARD, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AND GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWEXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 61 OF OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM

AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN

FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A

TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE

RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS WHICH CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER

RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS AND GNS PARTNERS. WHILE CONSUMER CREDIT RISK IS MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAN BORROWER-SPECIFIC EVENTS LIKE INSTITUTIONAL

CREDIT RISK, BOTH EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF LOSS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK.

RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION THAT WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS

FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE

MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS. CHANGES IN THE

INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE, AND

CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

40

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN

PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE INTEREST-ONLY STRIP (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE I/O STRIP) ARISING FROM OUR SECURITIZATION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND

EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, MAY BE LIMITED

 BELOW.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING

OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS,

EXPOSING US TO FINES AND/OR PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL

AGREEMENT, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC HARM TO US.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE



FINANCIAL REVIEWRISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

49-52 OF OUR 2007 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING 2007, OVER 30% OF OUR REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, MAY BE LIMITED.

IN GENERAL,

THE AMOUNT, TYPE AND COST OF OUR FUNDING, INCLUDING FINANCING FROM OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS, DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR EXPENSE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND GROWING OUR ASSETS AND THEREFORE, CAN POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD MAKE SUCH FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT, MORE EXPENSIVE OR UNAVAILABLE ON ANY TERMS BOTH

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY (WHERE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE ON TERMS MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND LOSSES, CHANGES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COUNTER-PARTY AVAILABILITY, CHANGES AFFECTING OUR ASSETS,

OUR CORPORATE AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, RATINGS AGENCIES ACTIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING AND TAX ENVIRONMENTS GOVERNING OUR FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS

IS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE GENERAL STATE OF THE

41

UNITED STATES AND WORLD ECONOMIES, AND MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS. ALSO, WE COMPETE FOR FUNDING WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE PUBLICLY TRADED. COMPETITION FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

IN ADDITION, WE

PERIODICALLY SECURITIZE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS ARISING FROM OUR CARD BUSINESS. SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE LEGAL SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOAN BALANCES TO A TRUST, WHICH IN TURN ISSUES SECURITIES TO

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS COLLATERALIZED BY THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND OUR RECEIPT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS LARGE AND

WELL-ESTABLISHED, IF THESE MARKETS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURITIZE OUR RECEIVABLES OR TO DO SO AT FAVORABLE PRICING LEVELS. IF WE WERE

UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SECURITIZE OUR LOAN RECEIVABLES AT DESIRED LEVELS, WE WOULD USE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND COST-EFFECTIVE AND STABLE ALTERNATIVES, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR

LIQUIDITY AND POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN RISKS. THESE RISKS WOULD INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS, AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AS MORE LOANS WOULD REMAIN ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND LOWER LOAN GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS MAY CAUSE THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS

TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE NEED FOR AN ALTERNATE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWFUNDING PROGRAMS ON PAGES 43-48 IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE

TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE, OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE

TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE

INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH CHANGES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF

MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX,

RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM

AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

42

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL

REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATRIOT ACT, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE

PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES US TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO PERFORM DUE

DILIGENCE ON THE THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS THAT ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THAT WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADOPTED A NEW

LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT WILL PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT

OF BUSINESS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING, OR MAY CONSIDER, LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IN THE AREA OF INTERNET

TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY, FOR EXAMPLE, IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS AIMED AT PREVENTING THE USE OF

PAYMENT CARDS TO UNLAWFULLY PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OVER THE INTERNET.

FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO CONTACTED PAYMENT COMPANIES CONCERNING THESE ISSUES. IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO

MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR OTHERWISE OVERSEE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY INCREASING OUR COSTS OR DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING

REGULATIONS COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR

CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN

THE UNITED KINGDOM, POLAND, GERMANY, SPAIN, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), AUSTRALIA, MEXICO, AND SWITZERLAND, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE WAY BANKCARD NETWORK MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY SET THE INTERCHANGE, WHICH

IS THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD. THE INTERCHANGE FEE IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO

MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND CREDIT CHARGES IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE COLLECTIVELY-SET INTERCHANGE FEES.

ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE

DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY

LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES AND INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO

MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS.

43

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE

BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MONITORING THIS ISSUE, IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE

RATES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN CONGRESS, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE UNDERTOOK A STUDY OF THE COST OF CREDIT CARD

ACCEPTANCE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES. DURING 2007, THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF BILLS PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE OR TO PROHIBIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE STATE TAX

PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF

A MERCHANTS SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE CARD HOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND SIMILAR PROPOSED STATE LEGISLATION WILL CONTINUE DURING 2008. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS COULD SURFACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL. IN THE EVENT THAT GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR

REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORS AND CONGRESS ARE CONTINUING THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR INDUSTRYS

PRICING, FINANCE CHARGES AND PRACTICES RELATING TO ITS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN APRS AND FEES. ANY LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE OUR SERVICES AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES FREELY COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TRANSACTION VOLUME AND REVENUES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF CONSUMER PRIVACY, DATA USE AND SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS ISSUED.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

WE DO BUSINESS, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONS INFORMATION SAFEGUARDS RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE RULE REQUIRES THAT

EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. THE HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH, CONTINUES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN 2008 THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD

AFFECT US.

IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 38 STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION,

REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH, AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION REQUIRING CERTAIN DATA SECURITY STANDARDS THAT

COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH

DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE

HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES.

REGULATION OF PRIVACY, DATA USE AND

SECURITY MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED LOOP CAPABILITY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY

44

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT COULD

RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE

UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION

AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER

OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS

CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE

OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE

OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND

THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS

OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT

OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.
