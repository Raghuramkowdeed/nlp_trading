ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT US AND OUR

BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE

BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING US. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WE FACE ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOP INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE

CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

STRATEGIC, BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC, MARKET, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD. UNEVEN GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND THE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT AND FINANCING PRODUCTS. A

PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF CARD MEMBERS TO PAY AMOUNTS OWED TO US. TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

EXPENDITURES, WHICH COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. BILLED BUSINESS DURING 2016, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND ALSO TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS TOWARD NATIONALISM AND PROTECTIONISM AND THE WEAKENING OR DISSOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE PACTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF, OR OTHERWISE INTERFERE

WITH, CONDUCTING BUSINESS. FURTHER, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING, INCLUDING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE

CAPITAL MARKETS, INFLATION AND DEFLATION ALL AFFECT THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING, LOWER DEMAND FOR CREDIT, LOWER

CORPORATE EARNINGS OR LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, SUCH FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE AND

DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, ADVERSELY AFFECTING, AND/OR INCREASING THE VOLATILITY OF, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE COMPETE WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, PAPER-BASED

TRANSACTIONS (E.G., CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND ACH), AS WELL AS EVOLVING AND GROWING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND FINANCING PROVIDERS.

WE BELIEVE VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE VISA AND MASTERCARD NETWORKS MAY BE ABLE TO

BENEFIT FROM THE DOMINANT POSITION, SCALE, RESOURCES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF THOSE NETWORKS.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY

GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, INCLUDING LARGER CASH RESERVES, MAY OFFER RICHER VALUE PROPOSITIONS OR A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING, MARKETING OR CROSS-SELLING

STRATEGIES TO ACQUIRE AND RETAIN MORE CUSTOMERS, CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF SPENDING AND BORROWINGS, ATTAIN AND DEVELOP MORE ATTRACTIVE COBRAND CARD PROGRAMS AND MAINTAIN GREATER MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. WE EXPECT EXPENSES SUCH AS CARD MEMBER REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE IMPROVE

OUR VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARD MEMBERS, INCLUDING IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COMPETITION.

SPENDING ON OUR CARDS COULD CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER

USAGE OF CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS, AS WELL AS ADOPTION OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH OR OTHER PAYMENT MECHANISMS. TO THE EXTENT OTHER PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND, OUR

DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS, DRIVE VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND/OR EFFECTIVELY GROW IN

AREAS SUCH AS MOBILE AND ONLINE PAYMENTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS.

TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO

NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. WE MAY

FACE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND WE MAY NEED TO DEDICATE MORE EXPENSE, TIME AND RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAN OUR COMPETITORS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE

NOT REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES THAT CONTROL ACCESS TO CONSUMER AND MERCHANT PAYMENT METHOD CHOICES THROUGH DIGITAL WALLETS, MOBILE APPLICATIONS OR AT THE POINT OF SALE COULD CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT OR COULD SUPPRESS USE OF

OUR PRODUCTS OR COULD RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACTION DATA. SUCH COMPANIES COULD ALSO REQUIRE PAYMENTS FROM US TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH DIGITAL WALLETS AND APPLICATIONS, IMPACTING OUR PROFITABILITY ON TRANSACTIONS. LAWS AND

BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS, REQUIRE CARD TRANSACTIONS TO BE ROUTED OVER DOMESTIC NETWORKS OR PROHIBIT OR LIMIT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. FURTHER, EXPANDING OUR

SERVICE OFFERINGS, ADDING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION CHANNELS AND FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS COULD HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN OUR CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR DILUTE OUR BRAND.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT DO

NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS CAN PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, INCLUDING PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, REGULATING OUR CONTRACT TERMS AND PRACTICES GOVERNING MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

COST STRUCTURE. SEE 

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING PROVISIONS IN OUR MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND/OR ARBITRATIONS, SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY

DAMAGES AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND

 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IF ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE

AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION FOR PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OR RENEGOTIATION

OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER

INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH DELTA AIR LINES, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS GLOBALLY, TO OFFER COBRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES,

AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARD MEMBER PARTICIPANTS. COMPETITION FOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS IS VERY INTENSE

AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW OR MAINTAIN THESE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS. ESTABLISHING AND RETAINING ATTRACTIVE COBRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS AS THESE PARTNERSHIPS

TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CUSTOMERS. OUR ENTIRE COBRAND PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 18 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. CARD MEMBER LOANS RELATED TO OUR COBRAND PORTFOLIO

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 34 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE CARD MEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO FOR A FIXED PERIOD, GENERALLY RANGING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WILL TERMINATE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR TERMS, INCLUDING AT THE END OF THE FIXED PERIOD UNLESS EXTENDED OR RENEWED AT THE OPTION OF THE PARTIES, OR UPON EARLY TERMINATION AS A RESULT OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OR OTHERWISE. WE FACE THE RISK THAT WE COULD LOSE PARTNER

RELATIONSHIPS, EVEN AFTER WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, TIME AND EXPENSE IN ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING THE RELATIONSHIPS. THE VOLUME OF BILLED BUSINESS COULD DECLINE AND CARD MEMBER ATTRITION COULD INCREASE, IN EACH CASE, SIGNIFICANTLY AS A

RESULT OF THE TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE COBRAND PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE THAT, UPON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION, THE COBRAND PARTNER MAY PURCHASE OR DESIGNATE A THIRD PARTY TO PURCHASE THE LOANS

GENERATED WITH RESPECT TO ITS PROGRAM, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS OUTSTANDING. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR U.S. COBRAND RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO ENDED IN 2016, AND WE SOLD THE OUTSTANDING CARD MEMBER LOANS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE COSTCO PORTFOLIO. IN 2016, STARWOOD HOTELS & RESORTS WORLDWIDE, WITH WHICH WE HAVE A COBRAND PARTNERSHIP, WAS ACQUIRED BY MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, WHICH HAS A COBRAND PARTNERSHIP WITH A COMPETING CARD ISSUER.

WE ALSO FACE THE RISK THAT EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE RENEGOTIATED WITH LESS FAVORABLE TERMS FOR US AS COMPETITION FOR SUCH RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. WE

MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR COBRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND

RETAINED. THE AMOUNT WE PAY TO OUR COBRAND PARTNERS HAS INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS ARRANGEMENTS ARE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION FOR COBRAND PARTNERS AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND

NETWORKS. WE MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO NOT CONTINUE CERTAIN COBRAND RELATIONSHIPS.

THE LOSS OF BUSINESS PARTNERS (WHETHER BY

NON-RENEWAL

AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD, SUCH AS THE END OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2016, OR EARLY TERMINATION AS THE RESULT OF A MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE WITHDRAWAL

OF AMERICAN AIRLINES IN 2014 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION



AND PLATINUM CARD



MEMBERS) OR THE RENEGOTIATION OF

EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH TERMS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE FOR US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD HARM

OUR REPUTATION, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, AND COULD WEAKEN OUR NEGOTIATING POSITION WITH OUR REMAINING AND PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

WE FACE CONTINUED INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARD MEMBER

SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES GENERALLY CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARD MEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE

SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE AND HAVE BEEN UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY-MANDATED REDUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS PRICING, TO REDUCE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. WE ALSO FACE PRESSURE FROM COMPETITORS THAT HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME OR LOWER EXPENSE BASES THAT CAN MAKE THEIR PRICING MORE ATTRACTIVE TO KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS.

MERCHANTS ARE ALSO ABLE TO NEGOTIATE INCENTIVES AND PRICING CONCESSIONS FROM US AS A CONDITION TO ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. AS MERCHANTS CONSOLIDATE AND BECOME EVEN LARGER, WE MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVES AND/OR CONCESSIONS WE PROVIDE TO

CERTAIN MERCHANTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY PRESSURES ON PRICING COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF THESE INCENTIVES. WE FURTHER EXPECT SOME EROSION OF OUR AVERAGE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE AS WE SEEK TO INCREASE MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OR OFFSETTING RATE EROSION WITH VOLUMES AT NEW MERCHANTS.

IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS AND TECHNOLOGIES FROM

NON-TRADITIONAL

PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND

THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. SOME MERCHANTS ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN PAYMENT SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS PROPRIETARY-BRANDED

MOBILE WALLETS, USING BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEW TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. IF MERCHANTS ARE ABLE TO DRIVE BROAD CONSUMER ADOPTION AND USAGE, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE AND BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES.

A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS WHICH, IF NOT SUCCESSFUL, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE DECLINES MORE THAN EXPECTED, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES, INCREASING OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, SUCH AS

FEE-BASED

REVENUE OR INTEREST INCOME, OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN MAINTAINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES OR OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SURCHARGING OR STEERING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU, MERCHANTS ARE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES. THE

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE EU THAT PERMIT SURCHARGING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SELECTIVE SURCHARGING OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS COULD INCREASE FOLLOWING ADOPTION OF NEW

EU-WIDE

REGULATION, AS DISCUSSED IN

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  PAYMENTS REGULATION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS IN CERTAIN MERCHANT CATEGORIES, AND IN SOME CASES, THE SURCHARGE IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO VISA AND

MASTERCARD CARDS, A PRACTICE THAT IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING.

WE ALSO ENCOUNTER MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER

TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF OUR CARDS. OUR CARD MEMBERS VALUE THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR CARDS WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO, AND WE, THEREFORE, TAKE STEPS TO MEET OUR CARD MEMBERS EXPECTATIONS AND TO

PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND BY PROHIBITING THIS FORM OF DISCRIMINATION, SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

IF SURCHARGING, STEERING OR OTHER FORMS OF

DISCRIMINATION BECOME WIDESPREAD, AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY COULD BECOME LESS DESIRABLE TO CONSUMERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

CARDS-IN-FORCE

AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE IMPACT COULD VARY DEPENDING ON SUCH FACTORS AS THE MANNER IN WHICH A SURCHARGE IS LEVIED, HOW CARD MEMBERS ARE STEERED TO

OTHER CARD PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE AND WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THESE ACTIONS ARE APPLIED TO OTHER PAYMENT CARDS, INCLUDING WHETHER IT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARD, NETWORK, ACQUIRER OR ISSUER. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR CARD MEMBERS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE

NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS.

INCORPORATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES AND TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME, AND ULTIMATELY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE,

AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ADAPTING TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS IS COMPLEX, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN, AND ANY FAILURE BY US TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING

TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS ACCURATELY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. CONSUMER AND MERCHANT ADOPTION IS A KEY COMPETITIVE FACTOR AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS, PLATFORMS OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT BECOME MORE WIDELY

ADOPTED THAN OURS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY UNDERESTIMATE THE TIME AND EXPENSE WE MUST INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BEFORE THEY GENERATE MATERIAL REVENUES, IF AT ALL.

OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, A CHANGING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, THE NEED FOR

INTERNAL PRODUCT AND ENGINEERING EXPERTISE, RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARD MEMBERS OR MERCHANTS, OR THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEMS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN

OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE AND CARD MEMBER REWARDS AND SERVICES, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

REVENUE GROWTH IS DEPENDENT ON INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND GROWING CARD LENDING BALANCES. WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING AT ELEVATED LEVELS ON A

NUMBER OF GROWTH INITIATIVES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INCLUDING TO ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS, REDUCE CARD MEMBER ATTRITION AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING AND BORROWINGS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR

INVESTMENTS TO ACQUIRE CARD MEMBERS AND INCREASE USAGE OF OUR CARDS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING AND ISSUING NEW AND ENHANCED CARDS OR CUSTOMERS MAY NOT ACCEPT OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH WOULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INCREASING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION OF MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS. IF THE RATE OF MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE GROWTH SLOWS OR REVERSES ITSELF, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

ANOTHER WAY WE INVEST IN CUSTOMER VALUE IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARD MEMBER BENEFITS. ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN, OR FAILURE BY

MANAGEMENT TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE, ACTUAL REDEMPTIONS OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AND ASSOCIATED REDEMPTION COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND COBRAND PROGRAMS AND MAY

INTRODUCE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OR MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN OURS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST-EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING,

PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE. IF SUCH EXPENSES CONTINUE TO INCREASE BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING PAYMENTS VOLUME, INCREASING OTHER AREAS OF

REVENUES SUCH AS

FEE-BASED

REVENUES, OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF OURS, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND.

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES, MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS  EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT FACTUALLY CORRECT  COULD ERODE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION

AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARD MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS AND CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION COULD RESULT FROM ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY

NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CARD PRACTICES, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND FROM ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORS OR OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CONDUCT. SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS CAN ALSO

CAUSE RAPID, WIDESPREAD REPUTATIONAL HARM TO OUR BRAND.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL.

FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR, MERCHANT ACQUIRER OR GNS PARTNER MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND VALUE. THE LACK OF ACCEPTANCE OR SUPPRESSION OF CARD USAGE BY

MERCHANTS CAN ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT PERCEPTIONS OF OUR BRAND AND OUR PRODUCTS, LOWER OVERALL TRANSACTION VOLUME AND INCREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHER PAYMENT PRODUCTS OR SYSTEMS. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY

ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS A CORPORATION WITH HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF

THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR OTHER POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

A SIGNIFICANT OPERATING DISRUPTION, A MAJOR INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT OR AN INCREASE IN

FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE, AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT, ANALYZE AND RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES.

GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION SECURITY RISK IN RECENT YEARS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF

INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBERATTACKS, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE CODE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS (INCLUDING PHISHING AND IMPERSONATION), DENIAL OF SERVICE AND SECURITY ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE AND OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL

SERVICES PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN THE TARGETS OF DISTRIBUTED

DENIAL-OF-SERVICE

ATTACKS FROM SOPHISTICATED THIRD PARTIES.

OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO CONSTANT ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES IN OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH INTENT TO DISRUPT OUR

BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAPTURE, DESTROY OR MANIPULATE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORPORATE TRADE SECRETS, CUSTOMER INFORMATION, INCLUDING CARD MEMBER AND LOYALTY PROGRAM ACCOUNT INFORMATION, EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND OTHER SENSITIVE

BUSINESS INFORMATION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MOTIVATIONS FOR CYBER THREAT ACTORS, INCLUDING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD, IDENTITY THEFT AND RANSOM, CORPORATE OR

NATION-STATE ESPIONAGE, POLITICAL AGENDAS, PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT WITH THE INTENT TO CAUSE FINANCIAL OR REPUTATIONAL HARM, INTENT TO DISRUPT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN

CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEBSITES.

AS OUTSOURCING, SPECIALIZATION OF FUNCTIONS AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY INCREASE, MORE THIRD PARTIES ARE

INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR TO WHICH THEY HAVE ACCESS, INCLUDING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS

PARTNERS, MAY BE COMPROMISED, WHICH COULD LEAD TO UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS ON OUR CARDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO SUCH AN INCIDENT.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES AIMED AT DETECTING AND PREVENTING INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS AND

FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT, MAINTENANCE AND ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND AS EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR

EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS, MALICIOUS SOCIAL ENGINEERING, FRAUDULENT OR OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES AND HUMAN ERROR OR MALFEASANCE CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN, INCLUDING

THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, RELEASE, GATHERING, MONITORING, MISUSE, MODIFICATION, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND OTHER INFORMATION (INCLUDING ACCOUNT DATA INFORMATION) OR NEGATIVE IMPACT TO ONLINE ACCOUNTS AND SYSTEMS. THESE

RISKS WILL LIKELY EVOLVE AS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE INCREASED USE OF EMV TECHNOLOGY, WE MAY SEE A DECREASE IN TRADITIONAL FRAUD RISK, BUT SOPHISTICATED FRAUDSTERS MAY DEVELOP NEW WAYS TO COMMIT FRAUD AND WE MAY SEE AN

INCREASE IN ONLINE FRAUD AND IMPERSONATION AND IDENTITY TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS.

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS, AND DATA CENTERS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, SUDDEN INCREASES IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, INTERNET OUTAGES,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD,

DENIAL-OF-SERVICE

AND OTHER CYBERATTACKS, TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC

BREAK-INS,

OR SIMILAR EVENTS. SERVICE DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL

REPORTING. INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH, OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FRAUD LEVELS OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OUR

CARDS OR CUSTOMER ONLINE ACCOUNTS WERE TO RISE DUE TO AN INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT AT A BUSINESS PARTNER, MERCHANT OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD TO THE LOSS OF DATA OR DATA INTEGRITY,

REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION (INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LITIGATION), REMEDIATION AND RESPONSE COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY

AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS OR BREACHES ARE NOT DETECTED QUICKLY, THEIR EFFECT COULD BE COMPOUNDED. INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS AND OTHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FAILURES TO

MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, PRIVACY AND/OR DATA PROTECTION, INCLUDING LEAKED BUSINESS DATA, MAY ALSO DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, UNDERMINE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH THE DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE COMPANY INFORMATION, DIVERT MANAGEMENT

ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES BY BANKING REGULATORS AND RATING AGENCIES.

SUCCESSFUL CYBERATTACKS OR DATA

BREACHES AT OTHER LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LARGE RETAILERS OR OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE IMPACTED, COULD LEAD TO A GENERAL LOSS OF CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT US, INCLUDING HARMING THE MARKET

PERCEPTION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR HARMING THE REPUTATION OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN GENERAL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INSURANCE FOR LOSSES RELATED TO CYBER RISKS AND

ATTACKS AND INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY, IT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF A MATERIAL LOSS EVENT.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH

BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS,

CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCELERATE

PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS COBRAND PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS: (I) OUR ECONOMIC CONDITION DETERIORATING SUCH THAT OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING IS DOWNGRADED

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY S&P AND MOODYS, (II) OUR CEASING TO HAVE A PUBLIC DEBT RATING, OR (III) A SHORTFALL IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD

UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED

TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY

IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARD MEMBERS FOR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, WHICH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS IN THE PAST. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016. OUR LARGEST AIRLINE COBRAND PORTFOLIO, AMERICAN EXPRESS DELTA SKYMILES, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND APPROXIMATELY

20 PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CARD MEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY TO THE EXTENT WE PROTECT CARD MEMBERS AGAINST

NON-DELIVERY

OF GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH

AS WHERE WE HAVE REMITTED PAYMENT TO AN AIRLINE FOR A CARD MEMBER PURCHASE OF TICKETS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN USED OR FLOWN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE AIRLINE, WE MAY BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED TO THE CARD

MEMBER.

INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK  EXPOSURE TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY UNDER MD&A.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY, AND OUR BUSINESS AND REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE HAVE ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE

MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND SECURE FUTURE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR COMPLETE PROPOSED

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR GROWTH. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE

ACQUISITION OR INVESTMENT, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

JOINT VENTURES, INCLUDING OUR GBT JV, AND MINORITY INVESTMENTS

INHERENTLY INVOLVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE FINANCIAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND/OR COMPLIANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT VENTURE OR MINORITY INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE

DEPENDENT ON JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT WHO MAY HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS, STRATEGIES OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OURS. BUSINESS DECISIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE PARTNER,

CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT, RESULT IN LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US AND OTHERWISE DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY

ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, PROCESSORS, AGGREGATORS, GNS PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES

FOR SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY FAILS TO PROVIDE THE DATA QUALITY, COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES

WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OR COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT ACTIVITIES OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. A FAILURE TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER

THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY ACTIONS, FINES, SANCTIONS OR ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR COMMUNICATED OVER THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS OR PLATFORMS COULD BECOME COMPROMISED, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR BUSINESS EVEN IF THE ATTACK OR BREACH DOES NOT

IMPACT OUR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL.

OUR BUSINESS

IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL

DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, FLOODS, HEALTH PANDEMICS, INTRUSION INTO OR DEGRADATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE

CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE, AND EVENTS IMPACTING OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY SECTORS, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

BECAUSE WE

DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO TRAVEL AND TOURISM, LIMITATIONS ON TRAVEL AND MOBILITY, AND HEALTH-RELATED RISKS. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER

FORMS OF TRAVEL CAN RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE OFFER AND, IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. CARD MEMBER SPENDING MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE EXIT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ELSEWHERE MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE EXIT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BREXIT), INCLUDING FROM A DETERIORATION OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND GENERAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE OVERALL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE

MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND STERLING AND THE EURO, FURTHER STRENGTHENING THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH COULD CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE EXIT ITSELF COULD

ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN ECONOMIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF CARD MEMBERS TO PAY AMOUNTS OWED TO US. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE EMEA

REGION CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS. IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS STAGE THE FINANCIAL, TRADE AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF BREXIT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PAYMENT SERVICES FROM THE UNITED

KINGDOM TO EU MEMBER STATES, WHICH MAY REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN EUROPE.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. CHANGES IN IMMIGRATION AND WORK PERMIT LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE ADMINISTRATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH LAWS OR REGULATIONS

CAN ALSO IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC. THIS REGULATORY REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND

OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING PROVISIONS IN OUR MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

LITIGATION AND/OR ARBITRATIONS, SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND

CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE THE

U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT

ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARD PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. FOLLOWING A

NON-JURY

TRIAL IN THE DOJ CASE, THE TRIAL COURT FOUND THAT THE CHALLENGED PROVISIONS WERE ANTICOMPETITIVE AND ON APRIL 30, 2015, THE COURT ISSUED A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERING A PERMANENT INJUNCTION.

FOLLOWING OUR APPEAL OF THIS JUDGMENT, ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2016, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT REVERSED THE TRIAL COURT DECISION AND DIRECTED THE TRIAL COURT TO ENTER A JUDGMENT FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH OCCURRED ON

JANUARY 25, 2017. THE DOJ AND STATES MAY SEEK FURTHER REVIEW OF THIS RULING. WE ARE ALSO A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE

NON-DISCRIMINATION

AND

HONOR-ALL-CARDS

PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS AND SEEK DAMAGES. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE OUR CARDS TO INCREASED MERCHANT STEERING AND OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION THAT COULD IMPAIR THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

LITIGATION AND/OR ARBITRATIONS, IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS OUR BUSINESS, AND HAS

THE POTENTIAL TO RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES, INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CUSTOMERS. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND

SUPERVISION OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ENHANCE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ARE NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY HOLDERS.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF ADDITIONAL REGULATION, ENHANCED SUPERVISION EFFORTS AND INCREASED AND UNPREDICTABLE REGULATORY

INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, AND POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL PENALTIES AND/OR RESTITUTION PAYMENTS TO CARD MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR

CHANGES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES, COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTNERS, MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS, OR AFFECT RETENTION OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL. SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY

NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND

ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND WE MAY BE RESTRICTED IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN CAPITAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS DECLARING DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASING OUTSTANDING SHARES) OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR BANKING REGULATORS HAVE WIDE DISCRETION IN THE EXAMINATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS AND MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS OR REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN

MORE CAPITAL.

IN RECENT YEARS, LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS IN PAYMENT

NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. EVEN WHERE WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY REGULATED, REGULATION OF BANKCARD FEES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR BUSINESS,

INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN SOME CASES, SUCH REGULATION EXTENDS TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, FOR EXAMPLE, GNS

ARRANGEMENTS OR TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR MERCHANTS, INCLUDING TERMS RELATING TO

NON-DISCRIMINATION

AND

HONOR-ALL-CARDS.

WE

HAVE BROUGHT A LEGAL CHALLENGE AND SEEK A RULING FROM THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE TO CLARIFY THE INTERPRETATION AND VALIDITY OF THE APPLICATION OF PRICE CAPS AS WELL AS OTHER REGULATORY MEASURES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THREE-PARTY NETWORKS ISSUE CARDS

WITH A COBRAND PARTNER OR THROUGH AN AGENT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LEGAL CHALLENGE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN REGULATIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON US, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  PAYMENTS

REGULATION. LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD ARE AWARE OF EACH OTHERS APPROACHES TO THE REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. CONSEQUENTLY, A DEVELOPMENT IN ONE COUNTRY, STATE OR REGION MAY INFLUENCE REGULATORY APPROACHES IN

ANOTHER.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. SIMILAR AML

REQUIREMENTS APPLY UNDER THE LAWS OF MOST JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS,

THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CUSTOMERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CARDS. ACTIVITY SUCH AS MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING INVOLVING OUR CARDS COULD RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTION, AND OUR

REPUTATION MAY SUFFER DUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES, PERSONS OR ENTITIES OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS.

VARIOUS

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART

DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE

GROWTH.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED EXPENSES,

DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND/OR A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

BUSINESSES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRIES HAVE HISTORICALLY

BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WHILE WE HAVE HISTORICALLY RELIED ON OUR ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN AGREEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO CLASS ACTION LITIGATION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ENFORCING OUR ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN THE FUTURE. THE CFPB ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE THAT, IF ENACTED, WOULD, AMONG OTHER

CHANGES, REQUIRE THAT OUR CONSUMER ARBITRATION CLAUSE NOT APPLY TO CASES FILED IN COURT AS CLASS ACTIONS, UNLESS AND UNTIL CLASS CERTIFICATION IS DENIED OR THE CLASS CLAIMS ARE DISMISSED. AS A RESULT, CLAIMS OF THE TYPE WE PREVIOUSLY ARBITRATED

COULD BE SUBJECT TO THE COMPLEXITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLASS ACTION CASES. THE CONTINUED FOCUS OF MERCHANTS ON ISSUES RELATING TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF VARIOUS FORMS OF PAYMENT MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS. GIVEN THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, AND THE VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES SOUGHT IN SOME MATTERS ASSERTED AGAINST US, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY WE MAY INCUR FROM LITIGATION MATTERS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS BY THE CFPB AND OTHER REGULATORS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO SUCH ACTIONS,

INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. REGULATORY ACTION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS

RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES, LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE EXPECT THAT REGULATORS WILL

CONTINUE TAKING FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING SUPERVISORY CONCERNS THROUGH

NON-PUBLIC

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS OR FINDINGS, WHICH COULD INVOLVE RESTRICTIONS ON

OUR ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES, AND IF WE FAIL TO

MEET THESE RULES, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FAILURE TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY

THE CAPITAL RULES, THE LCR, THE NSFR OR BY REGULATORS IN IMPLEMENTING OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK AND THE ENHANCED SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS.

THERE CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGIME THAT WILL APPLY TO US AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES. AS

A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT ON OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS NOT CERTAIN, ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN OUR CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET LEVELS COULD LOWER OUR RETURN ON EQUITY.

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED TO IMPLEMENT THE

INTERNATIONAL BASEL III FRAMEWORK AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING PHASED IN. THESE REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY ONCE THEY ARE FULLY PHASED IN, REQUIRE THE COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO SATISFY MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN

IN THE PAST. AS PART OF OUR REQUIRED STRESS TESTING, BOTH INTERNALLY AND BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL STANDARDS IN THE ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

EACH YEAR. TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO HOLD ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THAT REQUIRED BY THE CAPITAL RULES AS THEY ARE PHASED IN.

COMPLIANCE WITH CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL RULES AND THE LCR, REQUIRES A MATERIAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. AN INABILITY TO MEET

REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS REGARDING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY RULES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS.

WE CONTINUE TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE PARALLEL RUN PHASE OF BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACHES IMPLEMENTATION. DEPENDING ON HOW THE ADVANCED APPROACHES ARE ULTIMATELY

IMPLEMENTED FOR OUR ASSET TYPES, OUR CAPITAL RATIOS CALCULATED UNDER THE ADVANCED APPROACHES MAY BE LOWER THAN UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH. IN SUCH A CASE, WE MAY NEED TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REGULATORY CAPITAL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A GIVEN

CAPITAL RATIO.

THERE ARE SEVERAL RECENT PROPOSALS OR POTENTIAL PROPOSALS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD IMPOSE A CAPITAL BUFFER ON CERTAIN BANKS THAT MAY HAVE

AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMIES

(SO-CALLED

DOMESTIC SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS, OR

D-SIBS).

THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

NOT DESIGNATED ANY

D-SIBS

IN THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED A SERIES OF REVISIONS TO THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH FOR CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IF THESE

OR OTHER PROPOSALS ARE ADOPTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPLIED TO ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS OR IF WE ARE DESIGNATED AS A

D-SIB,

WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CAPITAL.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK. OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT

LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE CAPITAL

STOCK BY OUR REGULATORS, WHO HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT ANY ACTION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS ARE ASSESSED AGAINST OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A STRESSED MARKET ENVIRONMENT. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS TO OUR CAPITAL PLAN OR IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE CAPITAL ACTIONS MAY BE RESTRICTED.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, THE CAPITAL RULES INCLUDE A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WHICH IS BEING PHASED IN FROM JANUARY 1, 2016

THROUGH JANUARY 1, 2019. THE CAPITAL RULES ALSO INCLUDE A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SET AT ZERO BUT WHICH COULD BE INCREASED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE FUTURE. THESE BUFFERS CAN BE SATISFIED ONLY WITH CET1 CAPITAL.

IF OUR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS WERE TO FALL BELOW THE APPLICABLE BUFFER LEVELS, WE WOULD FACE GRADUATED CONSTRAINTS ON DIVIDENDS, STOCK REPURCHASES AND OTHER CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE SHORTFALL.

A FAILURE TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS ALONG WITH OUR COMPETITORS, OR ANY REDUCTION OF, OR ELIMINATION OF, OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WOULD LIKELY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS.

OUR ABILITY TO DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS ON, OR TO PURCHASE, REDEEM

OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE PROHIBITED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO NOT DECLARE AND PAY IN FULL DIVIDENDS FOR THE LAST PRECEDING DIVIDEND PERIOD OF OUR SERIES B AND SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY

PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. IN PARTICULAR, OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATUTORY AND REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON THEIR DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS WE MAY NEED TO

MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR OBLIGATIONS, MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK OR OTHERWISE ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.

REGULATION

IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND AFFECT OR LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE COLLECT AND/OR USE PERSONAL INFORMATION.

AS PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, INCLUDING DATA LOCALIZATION LAWS, ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED, COMPLIANCE COSTS MAY INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN

THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

IN ADDITION, STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AND/OR REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING OR REVISING PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY-RELATED PRACTICES, OUR COLLECTION, USE, SHARING, RETENTION AND SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, AND SOME OF OUR CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF

COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MOREOVER, THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING OR NEW LAWS TO EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND PRACTICES CAN BE UNCERTAIN AND MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE RISK AND

COST.

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS RELATING TO CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE DATA COULD RESULT IN HIGHER

COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY MAXIMIZE OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY OR PROVIDE CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY,

DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR ACTIONS, LITIGATION, FINES, SANCTIONS, ONGOING REGULATORY MONITORING, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, DECREASES IN THE USE

OR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS TO WHICH

WE ARE EXPOSED.

WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR INFORMATION

SYSTEMS, POOR DATA QUALITY, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT (E.G., NATURAL DISASTERS). OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT, A

FAILURE TO MONITOR A THIRD PARTYS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS

PROCESSES ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, WE MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. COMPLIANCE RISK ARISES FROM THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES,

REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS CAN EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS AS WELL AS FINES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES OR PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND CAN LEAD TO DIMINISHED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND DIMINISHED

ABILITY TO EXPAND KEY OPERATIONS.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON

ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD

PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY

SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

TAX LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES OR ASSESSMENTS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME AND OTHER TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO

TAX MATTERS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR POSITIONS ARE REASONABLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AND BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN ALL THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE ARE BEING CHALLENGED IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES REGARDING OUR APPLICATION OF VALUE-ADDED TAXES (VAT) TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE VAT AND OTHER TAX

LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS IN THE RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS, THE TAX AUTHORITIES MAY DETERMINE THAT WE OWE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR APPLY EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MORE BROADLY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIABILITIES FOR TAXES AND

INTEREST IN EXCESS OF ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

NEW TAX LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE PROPOSED FROM TIME TO TIME, SUCH AS PROPOSALS FOR COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM IN THE

UNITED STATES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TAX POSITIONS OR TAX LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, UNILATERAL OR MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIONS BY VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN TAX AUDIT ACTIVITY,

TO ADDRESS BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING BY MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX LIABILITIES.

CHANGES IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OR STANDARDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, EVEN IF THERE ARE NO UNDERLYING CHANGES IN THE ECONOMICS OF THE BUSINESS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN AND INTERPRETATIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING MATTERS THAT GOVERN THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR PERFORMANCE, WHICH COULD CHANGE THE WAY WE ACCOUNT

FOR CERTAIN OF OUR TRANSACTIONS EVEN IF WE DO NOT CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH WE TRANSACT. A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS, MAY RETROACTIVELY AFFECT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS AND COULD CAUSE

FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS

OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE

RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, ASSET LIABILITY RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, COMPLIANCE

RISK, MODEL RISK, STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT UNDER MD&A FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING

OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS

OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. THERE MAY ALSO BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED. AS REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE,

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR FORECASTING MODELS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT

AND INDEPENDENT MODEL VALIDATION, THE MODELING METHODOLOGY COULD BE ERRONEOUS OR THE MODELS COULD BE MISUSED. IF OUR DECISIONS ARE BASED ON INCORRECT OR MISUSED MODEL OUTPUTS AND REPORTS, WE MAY FACE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS FINANCIAL LOSS,

POOR BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING, OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, SOME DECISIONS OUR REGULATORS MAKE, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION PLANS, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THEY PERCEIVE THE QUALITY OF OUR

MODELS TO BE INSUFFICIENT.

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE INDIVIDUAL OR INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK, OR CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT

SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS AND THE ABILITY OF CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO PAY US, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM

MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS, GCS CLIENTS, LOYALTY COALITION PARTNERS AND TREASURY AND INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY,

REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE LOSSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO

RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. WE EXPECT THAT SOME MODEST,

GRADUAL UPWARD PRESSURE ON OUR

WRITE-OFF

RATES WILL CAUSE PROVISIONS TO GROW FASTER THAN LOANS IN 2017. HIGHER

WRITE-OFF

RATES AND THE RESULTING INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE

FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO

PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR

CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH

AS FRAUD. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGAL OR REGULATORY CHANGES (SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY LAWS AND MINIMUM PAYMENT REGULATIONS). INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER RESULTING FROM UNDERESTIMATING THE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES ARE GENERATED), CHANGES IN OUR MIX OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE, COULD

REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE

FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY

MERCHANTS, OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARD MEMBERS, CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES, A COMMITTED BANK BORROWING

FACILITY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS

DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR COMPETITORS AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY GENERALLY, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY AND LIMIT

OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO GROW OUR

BUSINESS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY INCUR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER

MD&A.

ANY REDUCTION IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO,

THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE US AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES, WHICH COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS

TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

ADVERSE CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR CAPITAL.

DURING 2016,

APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE REVENUE WE GENERATE

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016, FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET REVENUES OF $32.1 BILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION AS THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST MANY CURRENCIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGULATIONS OR CAPITAL CONTROLS MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OTHER CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS OR OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFER THEM. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD ALSO IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARD

MEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY AND FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARD MEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY. SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARD MEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR

ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD FURTHER IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONTINUING CONCERNS REGARDING THE OVERALL STABILITY OF THE EURO AND THE SUITABILITY OF THE EURO AS A SINGLE CURRENCY GIVEN THE DIVERSE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CIRCUMSTANCES IN INDIVIDUAL EUROZONE COUNTRIES MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE EURO TO FLUCTUATE MORE WIDELY THAN IN THE PAST AND COULD LEAD TO THE REINTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENCIES IN ONE OR MORE EUROZONE COUNTRIES, OR, IN MORE EXTREME

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POSSIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO CURRENCY ENTIRELY. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATION OF THE EURO AND WE ARE UNABLE TO HEDGE OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE TO THE EURO, THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

WOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED WHEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR INCLUSION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIMILARLY, THE REINTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES OR THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE REINTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES WOULD REQUIRE US TO RECONFIGURE OUR BILLING AND OTHER SYSTEMS TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES IN PLACE OF THE EURO. IMPLEMENTING SUCH

CHANGES COULD BE COSTLY AND FAILURES IN THE CURRENCY RECONFIGURATION COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE TO

RE-INTRODUCED

CURRENCIES MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US.

THE

POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING EUROPE AND THE EURO, OR MARKET PERCEPTIONS CONCERNING THESE AND RELATED ISSUES, COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTEREST RATE INCREASES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME,

COULD FALL. OUR INTEREST EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO OUR ANNUAL NET INTEREST INCOME OF

APPROXIMATELY $193 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. IN ADDITION, INTEREST RATE CHANGES MAY AFFECT CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR, SUCH AS IMPACTING THE LOAN BALANCES CARD MEMBERS CARRY ON THEIR CREDIT CARDS OR THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS HIGHER

INTEREST RATES LEAD TO HIGHER PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS, FURTHER IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR INTEREST RATE RISK, SEE RISK

MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS UNDER MD&A.

THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY

ECONOMIC, POLITICAL OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

MARKET RISK INCLUDES THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET

VARIABLES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. DEFAULTS OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, EVEN IN COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES IN

WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE MATERIAL INVESTMENT EXPOSURE, CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS

DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

OUR U.S. BANK

SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS, AND USE THE PROCEEDS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, WE HAD

APPROXIMATELY $52.3 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS, OF WHICH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT HAD BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION WITH REGARD TO DEPOSITS, AND PRICING AND PRODUCT CHANGES MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN COST-EFFECTIVE DEPOSIT BALANCES. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIAS

BROKERED DEPOSIT PROVISIONS AND RELATED FDIC RULES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES PROHIBIT BANKS FROM ACCEPTING OR RENEWING BROKERED DEPOSITS AND APPLY OTHER RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS A CAP ON INTEREST RATES THAT CAN BE PAID. SEE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND

HAD NO RESTRICTIONS REGARDING ACCEPTANCE OF BROKERED DEPOSITS OR SETTING OF INTEREST RATES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. THE CAPITAL RULES, PARTICULARLY WHEN FULLY PHASED IN, REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE

LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATES WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.
