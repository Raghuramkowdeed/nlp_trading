ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS

BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR THE

CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE

TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE ON THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR

CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WHO RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT

BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE TO THE REGULATORY

PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR

AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS INTENDED TO STIMULATE SUCH USE.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND

INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE, AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND

EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING OR IN MANAGING THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, OUR REVENUES AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE

ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION

AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT

OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES

AND PROFITABILITY.

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO

OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER

ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO

ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR

CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF

OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE

SUCCESSFUL AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND

ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING CONTINUING TO REINVEST SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING AND

PROMOTION), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS,

FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS

AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DOWNTURNS IN THESE

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO TO OFFER COBRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH

OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN

RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AIR LINES, WHICH WERE RESTRUCTURED IN CONNECTION WITH DELTAS FILING FOR PROTECTION UNDER

CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  AIRLINE INDUSTRY MATTERS ON PAGE 53 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF

THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN COBRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE

COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS

AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS

GENERALLY) THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED WEAKNESS OF KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS IN SUCH INDUSTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS AND THE RATE OF

BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS. CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES, AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK. WHILE CONSUMER CREDIT RISK IS MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS RATHER THAN BORROWER-SPECIFIC

EVENTS LIKE INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK, BOTH EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF LOSS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE

COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN

LOSSES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE

MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION THAT WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE

REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO

FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST

ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD

BUSINESS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET FINANCE

CHARGE REVENUE, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE INTEREST-ONLY STRIP (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE I/O STRIP) ARISING FROM OUR SECURITIZATION OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF

NOT ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE EXPENSE PROVISION

FOR THE COST OF OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE RISK THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE A DOWNTURN IN OUR BUSINESSES AND/OR NEGATIVE CHANGES IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER

CONTRACTS, DECREASED LIQUIDITY AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 42-45 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD

PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

ADVERSE

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING

2005, OVER 30% OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO

UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS

THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, MAY BE LIMITED.

IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT, TYPE AND COST OF OUR FUNDING, INCLUDING FINANCING FROM OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS, DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR

EXPENSE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND GROWING OUR ASSETS AND THEREFORE, CAN POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

A

NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD MAKE SUCH FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT, MORE EXPENSIVE OR UNAVAILABLE ON ANY TERMS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY (WHERE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE ON TERMS MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES), INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND LOSSES, CHANGES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COUNTER-PARTY AVAILABILITY, CHANGES AFFECTING OUR ASSETS, OUR CORPORATE AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, RATINGS AGENCIES ACTIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE

LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING AND TAX ENVIRONMENTS GOVERNING OUR FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS IS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE GENERAL STATE OF THE U.S. AND WORLD ECONOMIES, AND MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO

ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS. ALSO, WE COMPETE FOR FUNDING WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE PUBLICLY TRADED. COMPETITION FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, WE PERIODICALLY SECURITIZE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS ARISING FROM OUR CARD BUSINESS.

SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE LEGAL SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOAN BALANCES TO A TRUST, WHICH IN TURN ISSUES SECURITIES TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS COLLATERALIZED BY THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND OUR RECEIPT

OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS LARGE AND WELL-ESTABLISHED, IF THESE MARKETS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURITIZE OUR

RECEIVABLES OR TO DO SO AT FAVORABLE PRICING LEVELS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SECURITIZE OUR LOAN RECEIVABLES AT DESIRED LEVELS, WE WOULD USE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND COST-EFFECTIVE

AND STABLE ALTERNATIVES, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN RISKS. THESE RISKS WOULD INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS, AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE

CREDIT LOSSES AS MORE LOANS WOULD REMAIN ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND LOWER LOAN GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN

EVENTS MAY CAUSE THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE NEED FOR AN ALTERNATE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING STRATEGY ON PAGES 35-40 IN THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE

AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO

COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS,

E.G.

, TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS,

MULTI-APPLICATION SMART CARDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW

SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS AND NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, OUR

ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH CHANGES IN ADDITION TO PATENT RIGHTS HELD BY COMPETITORS OR OTHERS. OUR

FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OR ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE

MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE MORE

EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES THROUGH OUR

NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATRIOT ACT, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE

PATRIOT ACT REQUIRED US TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN

THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED AND WHERE WE PROVIDE PRIVATE AND

CORRESPONDENT BANKING SERVICES, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

THE U.S.

CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING REGULATORY INITIATIVES IN THE AREAS OF INTERNET GAMBLING, INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR

COMPANY. MANY U.S. STATES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR OTHERWISE OVERSEE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY

INCREASING OUR COSTS OR DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY,

IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR

REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, IN 2004, A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS WERE ISSUED IMPLEMENTING THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT

TRANSACTIONS ACT THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKES PERMANENT THE PREEMPTIVE EFFECT OF SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORS AND CONGRESS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR PRICING OF CREDIT. ANY LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE CREDIT FREELY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED AMOUNTS OF CREDIT AVAILABLE TO OUR CARDMEMBERS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TRANSACTION VOLUME AND REVENUES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A

REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

EXISTING

AND PROPOSED REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF CONSUMER PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY COULD DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED AND COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONS INFORMATION SAFEGUARDS RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE RULE REQUIRES THAT EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP,

IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND

THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. IN 2005, THERE WAS A HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH. IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE A

NUMBER OF BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN 2006 THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY

BREACH, AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL HAVE PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE

FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA

PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. REGULATION OF PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THESE AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS FOR ISSUING CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS, WHICH MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CARDS WE ISSUE. ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN THESE AREAS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. FINALLY, FAILURE TO

COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS OR OTHER PENALTIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OVERALL BUSINESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT TRENDS IN CONSUMER SPENDING

AND IN TRAVEL.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF SPENDING USING OUR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS, AND WE ARE

NOT INSULATED FROM THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES. A SUSTAINED DETERIORATION IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE, OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES IN KEY COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OR AVERAGE PURCHASE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND RESULT IN INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES. POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES

COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER

CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION

OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS MAY DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE OR

PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE

INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER,

OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE

OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY

PROVIDERS MANY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE

DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR THIRD-PARTY VENDORS WILL PERFORM THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS EXPECTED.
