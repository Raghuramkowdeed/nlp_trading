PART I

ITEM 1: BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN CHASE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.), WITH $2.0 TRILLION IN ASSETS, $165.4 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

AND OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN 23 STATES, AND

CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE BANK USA, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT

IS THE FIRMS CREDIT CARDISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMORGAN SECURITIES), THE FIRMS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK

AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES

AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH

ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON

FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR

SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS

FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND

OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO SIX BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE

INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENTS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES SEGMENTS.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR

RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A), BEGINNING ON

PAGE 53 AND IN NOTE 34 ON PAGE 237.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

HEDGE FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING

COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES,

LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES AND ADVISORY

COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE

QUALITY AND RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION AND PRICE.

COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES

SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY;

WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO

DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS

REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED

AND, IN SOME CASES, FAILED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD

RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A

BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL

BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL

PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE

APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES

BUSINESS.

RECENT EVENTS AFFECTING THE FIRM.

EVENTS SINCE EARLY 2008 AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

AND, MORE GENERALLY, THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE, HAVE LED TO VARIOUS

PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN 2009, THE HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES PASSED THE WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2009, WHICH, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, CALLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAVING BROAD

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES; CREATES A NEW STRUCTURE FOR RESOLVING TROUBLED OR FAILED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS;

REQUIRES CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO BE CLEARED IN A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE

AND/OR EFFECTED ON THE EXCHANGE; REVISES THE ASSESSMENT BASE FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) ASSESSMENTS; AND CREATES A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING PROVIDING REGULATORS WITH THE POWER TO

REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES IF THEY DETERMINE THAT

THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE

COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES. OTHER PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE BOTH

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND

LIMITATIONS ON SIZE OR TYPES OF ACTIVITY IN WHICH BANKS MAY ENGAGE. IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME

WHICH OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL BE FINALLY ENACTED INTO LAW, OR WHAT FORM THEY WILL TAKE, OR WHAT NEW

PROPOSALS MAY BE MADE, AS THE DEBATE OVER FINANCIAL REFORM CONTINUES IN 2010. THE DESCRIPTION BELOW

SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES, COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY

AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE STRUCTURE OF THE FIRM AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS COULD ALSO

CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF

MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA). UNDER

REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD), IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO

MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE

CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON

ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY

RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER

THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MET THE CAPITAL,

MANAGEMENT AND CRA REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES

PERMITTED UNDER GLBA.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN

UNAFFILIATED BANK. PURSUANT TO THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF

1994 (THE RIEGLE-NEAL ACT), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR SUCH AN

ACQUISITION WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAW OF ANY STATE,

PROVIDED THAT THE ACQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANY, BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION, DOES NOT CONTROL

MORE THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. OR

MORE THAN 30% (OR SUCH GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNTS AS PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW) OF THE TOTAL

DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACQUIRED BANK HAS ITS HOME

OFFICE OR A BRANCH.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES

ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF

THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). SEE OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW FOR A FURTHER

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL

BANKS. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AS NATIONAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT

BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS

THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED

PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY

NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGE 228 FOR THE AMOUNT OF

DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2010 AND 2009, TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND

THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN

THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND

PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF ADDITIONAL DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, SEE

NOTE 23 ON PAGES 222-223.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFFBALANCE SHEET

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO RISK WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED

FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED

INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE

AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE

GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THESE

GUIDELINES, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES 228229.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE

LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS. THE MINIMUM

LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD GUIDELINES OR WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE

FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON

THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE

PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II

RULE IN DECEMBER 2007 WHICH REQUIRES JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT BASEL II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY

LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS KEY U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING BASEL II, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON

PAGE 83.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, THE SEC AUTHORIZED JPMORGAN SECURITIES TO USE THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF

COMPUTING NET CAPITAL FOR BROKER/DEALERS THAT ARE PART OF CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITIES AS

DEFINED BY SEC RULES. ACCORDINGLY, JPMORGAN SECURITIES MAY

2

CALCULATE DEDUCTIONS FOR MARKET RISK USING ITS INTERNAL MARKET RISK MODELS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES 8384.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. AS

PART OF THAT FRAMEWORK, THE FDICIA REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET

CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES.

THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE;

HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS

AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO

AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE

FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

UNDER CURRENT FDIC REGULATIONS, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO A

RISK CATEGORY BASED ON CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES. IN 2009, THE FDIC REVISED THE METHOD FOR

CALCULATING THE ASSESSMENT RATE FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS BY INTRODUCING SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS TO

AN INSTITUTIONS INITIAL BASE ASSESSMENT RATE. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSESSED PREMIUMS BY THE

FDIC BASED ON ITS RISK CATEGORY AS ADJUSTED AND THE AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS HELD. HIGHER LEVELS OF BANKS

FAILURES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FDIC AND

DEPLETED THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR INSURED

DEPOSITS HAS BEEN INCREASED GENERALLY FROM $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR TO $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR. IN

LIGHT OF THE INCREASED STRESS ON THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND CAUSED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IN

ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE THE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

FUND, THE FDIC IMPOSED A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT IN JUNE, 2009, HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF

INSURED INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY, AND REQUIRED THEM TO PREPAY ON DECEMBER 30, 2009 THE PREMIUMS THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME DUE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED

THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN

OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;

(2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3)

TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE

PERFORMANCE OF WHICH

IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR

REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR

SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN

THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF

THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION,

INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR

OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO

REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OR DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES OF ANY

SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A., OR CHASE BANK USA, N.A., SUCH PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE,

IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH

SUCH INSTITUTION BEING IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS

CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST

SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT (BSA) REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.

THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH AND SUSPICIOUS

ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE DILIGENCE/KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THE

FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH BSA

REQUIREMENTS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES

TO SUPPORT THESE SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY

VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING

COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS

TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW

ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES,

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE

RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LIMITS. FOR MORE

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGE 230.

THE FIRMS BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL

REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN

CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE

RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS

OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AND IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, AMONG OTHER POWERS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. THROUGH

JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS

OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AMONG

OTHERS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMILAR SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. SUBJECT TO LOCAL

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.), THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED BY J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES LTD., WHICH IS REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY OF THE U.K. THE

OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC.

THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD AND ARE

REGISTERED ACCORDINGLY. IN THE U.S., THREE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION

MERCHANTS, WITH OTHER SUBSIDIARIES REGISTERED WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE

CFTC) AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRMS U.S. ENERGY BUSINESS

IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER

EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION BOTH IN

THE U.S. AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY.

THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED

PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH

RESPECT

TO THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS, AND THE

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN

THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN GLBA.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON

PAGE 135. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER

REPORTS THAT WE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. YOU SHOULD NOT

CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD

AFFECT US.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE

LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CORPORATE OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;

INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,

ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR

EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES. THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACTIVITY

LEVELS OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR

INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES;

THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM OUR PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES; THE

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE WE RECEIVE

FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS WE MANAGE ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS;

AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR

UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY US.

WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS AND WE MAY HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME SIGNIFICANT POSITIONS, INCLUDING POSITIONS IN SECURITIES

IN MARKETS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET

VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT STANDING; OUR SUCCESS

IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING OUR MARKET AND OTHER RISKS; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT

AND COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS; AND

OTHER ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REVENUE RELATING TO OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT

PRICING OR OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING

MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS WE MANAGE OR HOLD IN CUSTODY, WHICH,

IN TURN, COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT WE RECEIVE.

DURING 2008, U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF LIQUIDITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, REDUCED BUSINESS ACTIVITY, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, DECLINING HOME

PRICES, AND EROSION OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009. WHILE THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT STABILIZED DURING THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

REMAINS WEAK, WHICH AFFECTS OUR BUSINESSES PROFITABILITY.

OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS

INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

THE DETERIORATION OF THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN

DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

DURING 2008 AND CONTINUING IN 2009, HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED

RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION AND DEPLETED THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

FUND. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT

INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS AND ADOPTED A RULE

IN NOVEMBER 2009 REQUIRING BANKS TO PREPAY THREE YEARS WORTH OF PREMIUMS TO REPLENISH THE DEPLETED

INSURANCE FUND. IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FAILURES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED

TO PAY EVEN HIGHER FDIC PREMIUMS THAN THE RECENTLY INCREASED LEVELS. ANY FUTURE INCREASES OF FDIC

INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS (WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT RECOURSE), THE

ORIGINATOR IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A VARIETY OF CUSTOMARY

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

REGARDING BOTH THE ORIGINATOR AND THE LOANS BEING SOLD OR SECURITIZED. WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS ENTITIES ACQUIRED BY US AS PART OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, AND THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, HAVE MADE SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF OUR LENDING BUSINESS.

IF A LOAN  DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES

IS SOLD OR SECURITIZED, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN AND BEAR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS

DIRECTLY, OR WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSSES. IN 2009, THE

COSTS OF REPURCHASING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SOLD TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS FREDDIE MAC

AND FANNIE MAE  INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, AND COULD CONTINUE TO

INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY FURTHER. ACCORDINGLY,  REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES OR TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITIONS, OR FURTHER CONTINUED

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC, MARKET OR BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT

ON THE FIRM IN THE FUTURE.

IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. SOME

POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE

MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER

ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND

LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN US OR OUR PROSPECTS. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY

EVENTS OVER WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN

2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR

TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS. THESE OR OTHER CONDITIONS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY

MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING

TO LEND TO US, THEREBY CURTAILING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION

IN THE RATINGS OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT

COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,

TO US BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING. CRITICAL FACTORS IN

MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL

RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND

DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES)

OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS AND

MARKET-DRIVEN, AND INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. AS SUCH, OUR CREDIT

SPREADS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE RELY ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR OUR CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE

FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES AND LENDING COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

OUR EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS. WE ESTIMATE AND ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR

CREDIT RISKS AND POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THIS PROCESS, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION,

REQUIRES DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR BORROWERS TO REPAY THEIR LOANS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY

SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT WE WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR

THAT WE WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY. ANY SUCH FAILURE

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK

IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET ILLIQUIDITY, SUCH AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND EARLY 2009. DURING SUCH PERIODS, OUR CREDIT

RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS

LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURE DUE US. IN ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT

ANY SUCH LOSSES WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS

THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (LBHI). ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2008, LBHI FILED A

VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE (THE

BANKRUPTCY CODE) IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND

THEREAFTER SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11

OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE (LBHI AND SUCH SUBSIDIARIES COLLECTIVELY, LEHMAN). ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008,

A LIQUIDATION CASE UNDER THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT

(SIPA) WAS COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. (LBI), LBHIS U.S.

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, AND THAT COURT NOW PRESIDES OVER THE LBI

SIPA LIQUIDATION CASE. WE WERE LBIS CLEARING BANK AND,

AMONG OTHER ACTIONS, MADE COLLATERAL CALLS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8

BILLION IN SEPTEMBER 2008 AND LIQUIDATED APPROXIMATELY $18 BILLION OF SECURITIES SUBSEQUENT TO

LEHMANS BANKRUPTCY FILING. WE ARE THE LARGEST SECURED CREDITOR IN THE LEHMAN AND LBI CASES,

ACCORDING TO LEHMANS SCHEDULES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US AND/OR OUR

SECURITY INTERESTS, INCLUDING BY THE LBHI CREDITORS COMMITTEE, THE SIPA TRUSTEE APPOINTED IN THE

LBI LIQUIDATION CASE, THE PRINCIPAL ACQUIRER OF LBIS ASSETS, AND OTHERS IN CONNECTION WITH LEHMAN

AND LBI CASES. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELF AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS. THE LBHI EXAMINER HAS FILED A

REPORT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT REGARDING HIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE

COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN. THE

REPORT REMAINS UNDER SEAL.

IF THE CURRENT WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, OR DETERIORATES

FURTHER, THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME

DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO US WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL

OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE

OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT

DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY, THEREBY EXACERBATING OUR CREDIT RISK

EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES, INCLUDING MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES, WE COULD INCUR IN OUR

TRADING AND CLEARING BUSINESSES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO

ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND ANY CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK COULD

INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN

THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO SELL,

SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS HELD BY US, THEREBY

LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF SUCH POSITIONS. THESE CONCENTRATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO

LOSSES IF THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS

DECLINE CAUSING US TO TAKE WRITE DOWNS. MOREOVER, THE INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS NOT ONLY

INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL

OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO US.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO US. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES

AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISKS AND

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE

INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE

FUTURE, RISKS THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET

ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO

DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

OUR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT

COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT

EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME

CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO

ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN

OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT WE DO NOT OWN; IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO

FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO US AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE DERIVATIVES

TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT

AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, WE MAY FIND THE CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT TO

ENFORCE. FURTHER, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING THE

TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF THE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE US TO INCUR

UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LEGAL COSTS, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

EFFECTIVELY OUR RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET

BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY US ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR

ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIES, CAUSING US TO INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS OUR BUSINESSES CHANGE AND GROW AND THE

MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP

SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED,

MONITORED OR MANAGED. WE CANNOT PROVIDE

ASSURANCE THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY, POLITICAL, LEGAL

AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN

THE UNITED STATES. ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING

AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO

MATERIALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, SUCH AS DEBT SECURITIES AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). ITS POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWERS, POTENTIALLY

INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF

THESE CHANGES ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

OUR BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VARIOUS

UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR INVEST, OR IN

WHICH WE MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS

PARTICULAR TO THAT COUNTRY OR REGION, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR

LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY

ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE

ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE

FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE

FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE

ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS.

ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST,

AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OUR OPERATIONS

IN THE U.S. ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT COST

AND LIABILITY.

WE ENGAGE IN POWER GENERATION, AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANK, WE ENGAGE IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS,

ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE EXPECT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR POWER

GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION,

LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS. OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER

EXPOSES US TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS,

SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND

TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO

OUR REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE

SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF

POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL

FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO

OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OUR

ACTIONS TO MITIGATE OUR RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE

TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE

AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER

LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

WE RELY ON OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE

ARE SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR

OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES OUR OPERATIONS OR

SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO US,

INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF

THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN

POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN OUR POSSESSION WERE

TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR

EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO

PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE

INFORMATION, EITHER BY FAULT OF OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR SUCH INFORMATION WAS

INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, ELECTRICAL OR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, OR OTHER DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS; HEALTH

EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING

TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR

LIABILITY TO US.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS OURS, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE

RISK THAT OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

COULD PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY

EXPOSING US TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE

LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE TYPE AND MANNER IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED.

RECENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO NEW LEGISLATION AND NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR

CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION AND REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATION

AFFECTING THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CARD SERVICES BUSINESS BY

REDUCING REVENUE AND INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS.

RECENT PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER REGULATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND

INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDE CALLS TO INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS; LIMIT THE SIZE

AND TYPES OF THE ACTIVITIES PERMITTED; AND INCREASE TAXES ON SOME INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2009 RECENTLY PASSED BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAVING

BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS CREATE A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

COMPANIES, AND PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE POWER TO REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER

ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES IF THE REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF

THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF

THE UNITED STATES. ALSO PROPOSED IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES MARKET, INCLUDING PROVIDING FOR

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MORE STRICT CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES, AND HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION OF ALL OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALERS AND MAJOR

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM.

THESE NEW (AND OTHER) LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

REVENUE, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WE MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING

IN, IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATION WOULD NOT HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR

OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THE

JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT

HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. AS THIS REGULATORY TREND CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM

PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US.

WE ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS

ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR

PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS,

SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO US, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE US SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL

HARM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR

BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WE EXPECT COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER,

BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER

ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

WE ALSO FACE AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST

COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES,

E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR

NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING

PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC

AND

INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. OUR BUSINESSES

GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION

EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF

THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE US TO

LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT

IN OUR BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY

REQUIRE US TO EXTEND MORE OF OUR CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE

COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS

ANTICIPATED.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS,

INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE

INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED

ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE

COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS,

SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. INTEGRATION EFFORTS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT

ANY INTEGRATION EFFORTS OF ACQUISITIONS ALREADY CONSUMMATED OR ANY NEW ACQUISITIONS WOULD NOT

RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES.

WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED CREDIT COSTS OR NEED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS AND

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE ASSETS AND LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER (THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER) BY JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) AND IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS (WASHINGTON MUTUAL) BANKING OPERATIONS (THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION). WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT AS OUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS CONTINUE IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, OTHER UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO REMOVE THEIR ACCOUNTS FROM US AND MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN

THE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND

POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS,

DEPOSITORS AND EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS.

DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR ATTRACTING AND MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS,

INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO OUR

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO OUR

REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT,

LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY,

COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING US, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO OUR PROSPECTS.

ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE

INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS

IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG OUR CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE

TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH

US, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO US.

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE.

OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON US OR ON OUR EMPLOYEES

OF CERTAIN OF THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS OR TAXES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, OUR PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD

CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE ARE

REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING

IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN

REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN

ORDER TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE MAY

MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY

RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE

NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION

PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, BEING BASED ON

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION

AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN

PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET

ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR

ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO DECLINES IN OUR EARNINGS.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

JPMORGAN CHASES HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY AT 270 PARK AVENUE, WHICH IS A

50-STORY OFFICE BUILDING OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THIS LOCATION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION

SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. THE BUILDING IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A MAJOR RENOVATION IN FIVE STAGES. THE

DESIGN SEEKS TO ATTAIN THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY RATING FOR RENOVATIONS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS

UNDER THE LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEM. THE

RENOVATIONS OF FLOORS 15  50 ARE COMPLETE. THE RENOVATION OF THE EXTERIOR PLAZA AND THE LOBBY

BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009. THE TOTAL RENOVATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY

MID-YEAR 2011.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER IN 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED 383 MADISON AVENUE IN

NEW YORK CITY, A 45-STORY, 1.1 MILLION SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE BUILDING ON LAND WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

GROUND LEASE THROUGH 2096. THIS BUILDING SERVES AS THE U.S. HEADQUARTERS OF JPMORGAN CHASES

INVESTMENT BANK.

IN TOTAL, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNED OR LEASED APPROXIMATELY 12.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL

OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

SQUARE FEET OF SPACE IN THE UNITED STATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM MANAGED AND OCCUPIED APPROXIMATELY 3.7 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF

SPACE IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, JPMORGAN CHASE LEASED APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE

AND OWNED A 360,000 SQUARE-FOOT OPERATIONS CENTER AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE

ACQUIRED A 999-YEAR LEASEHOLD INTEREST IN LAND AT CANARY WHARF, LONDON, AS THE POSSIBLE FUTURE SITE

FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. INITIALLY, THE DESIGN WAS FOR A BUILDING

AREA OF 1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET AND UP TO FIVE TRADING FLOORS; IT IS NOW MODIFIED TO 1.7 MILLION

SQUARE FEET AND UP TO FOUR TRADING FLOORS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT

STAGE AND CONTINUES TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO MODIFY THE DESIGN. JPMORGAN

CHASE, BY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER (AS RENEGOTIATED IN 2009), HAS THE ABILITY TO DEFER

COMMENCEMENT OF THE MAIN CONSTRUCTION THROUGH AT LEAST OCTOBER 2011. JPMORGAN CHASE

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IS RECONSIDERING ITS OCCUPANCY OPTIONS IN LONDON DURING THIS DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE BUILDING DESIGN WILL

STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY RATING.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF

OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS, AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF

SPACE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES. JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE

REQUIREMENTS AND MAY DETERMINE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CERTAIN OF ITS PREMISES AND FACILITIES ARE NO

LONGER NECESSARY FOR ITS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF

ANY SUCH EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS.

SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS

HAVE COMMENCED PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS

AND/OR DIRECTORS ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS WHO PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OF BEAR

STEARNS BETWEEN DECEMBER 14, 2006 AND MARCH 14, 2008 (THE CLASS PERIOD). THE ACTIONS, ORIGINALLY

COMMENCED IN SEVERAL FEDERAL COURTS, ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS ISSUED MATERIALLY FALSE AND

MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING BEAR STEARNS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THAT, AS A RESULT

OF THOSE FALSE STATEMENTS, BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK TRADED AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES DURING

THE CLASS PERIOD. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS, THE COMPLAINTS ASSERT CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS

OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. SEPARATELY, SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL

SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS HAVE COMMENCED OR THREATENED TO COMMENCE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND

LAWSUITS ASSERTING CLAIMS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED

AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SEEKING TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE

BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF DECEMBER 2006 TO

MARCH 2008. THESE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO PLAINTIFFS AND

TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE ESOP BY (A) FAILING TO MANAGE PRUDENTLY THE

ESOPS INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS SECURITIES; (B) FAILING TO COMMUNICATE FULLY AND ACCURATELY ABOUT

THE RISKS OF THE ESOPS INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS STOCK; (C) FAILING TO AVOID OR ADDRESS ALLEGED

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; AND (D) FAILING TO MONITOR THOSE WHO MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED THE ESOP. IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS, EACH PLAINTIFF ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS UNDER VARIOUS

SECTIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AND SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT TO THE

ESOP FOR ALL LOSSES, AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF MONETARY DAMAGES AND IMPOSITION OF A CONSTRUCTIVE

TRUST.

BEAR STEARNS, FORMER MEMBERS OF BEAR STEARNS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF BEAR STEARNS

FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN TWO PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE SUITS, SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE ACTION, PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. PLAINTIFFS ARE ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS AND GROSS

MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION IN

CONNECTION WITH THE LOSSES SUSTAINED BY BEAR STEARNS AS A RESULT OF ITS PURCHASES OF SUBPRIME LOANS

AND CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS OWN COMMON STOCK. CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALSO ALLEGED TO

HAVE SOLD THEIR HOLDINGS OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION. PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT AND AN ORDER DIRECTING

BEAR STEARNS TO IMPROVE ITS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES. PLAINTIFFS LATER FILED A SECOND

AMENDED COMPLAINT ASSERTING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CLAIMS FOR VIOLATION OF

SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS WELL AS NEW ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING EVENTS

THAT TOOK PLACE IN MARCH 2008.

ALL OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURTS WERE ORDERED TRANSFERRED AND JOINED FOR

PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

MOTIONS TO DISMISS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE PURPORTED SECURITIES CLASS ACTION, THE SHAREHOLDERS

DERIVATIVE ACTION AND THE ERISA ACTION.

BEAR STEARNS MERGER LITIGATION.

SEVEN PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS (FIVE THAT WERE COMMENCED IN NEW YORK

AND TWO THAT WERE COMMENCED IN DELAWARE) WERE CONSOLIDATED IN NEW YORK STATE COURT IN MANHATTAN

UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE BEAR STEARNS LITIGATION

. BEAR STEARNS, AS WELL AS ITS FORMER DIRECTORS AND

CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS. JPMORGAN CHASE WAS ALSO NAMED

AS A DEFENDANT. THE ACTIONS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS BREACHED

THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS TO BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDERS BY AGREEING TO THE PROPOSED

MERGER. THE FIRM WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE AIDED AND ABETTED THE ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY;

BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY AS CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER/CONTROLLING ENTITY; TORTIOUSLY INTERFERED

WITH THE BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDERS VOTING RIGHTS; AND TO HAVE BEEN UNJUSTLY ENRICHED. PLAINTIFFS

INITIALLY SOUGHT TO ENJOIN THE PROPOSED MERGER AND ENJOIN THE FIRM FROM VOTING CERTAIN SHARES

ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED MERGER. THE PLAINTIFFS SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED

THE COURT THAT THEY WERE WITHDRAWING THAT MOTION, BUT AMENDED THE CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT TO PURSUE

CLAIMS, WHICH INCLUDED A CLAIM FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES. IN DECEMBER 2008,

THE COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF ALL THE DEFENDANTS. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A NOTICE

OF APPEAL.

BEAR STEARNS HEDGE FUND MATTERS

. BEAR STEARNS, CERTAIN CURRENT OR FORMER SUBSIDIARIES OF BEAR

STEARNS, INCLUDING BEAR STEARNS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. (BSAM) AND BEAR STEARNS & CO. INC., AND

CERTAIN CURRENT OR FORMER BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEES ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS (COLLECTIVELY THE BEAR

STEARNS DEFENDANTS) IN MULTIPLE CIVIL ACTIONS AND ARBITRATIONS RELATING TO THE FAILURE OF THE BEAR

STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT STRATEGIES MASTER FUND, LTD. (THE HIGH GRADE FUND) AND THE

BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT STRATEGIES ENHANCED LEVERAGE MASTER FUND, LTD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

(THE ENHANCED LEVERAGE FUND) (COLLECTIVELY, THE FUNDS). BSAM SERVED AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR

BOTH OF THE FUNDS, WHICH WERE ORGANIZED SUCH THAT THERE WERE U.S. AND CAYMAN ISLANDS FEEDER FUNDS

THAT INVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THEIR ASSETS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE FUNDS. THE FUNDS ARE

IN LIQUIDATION.

THERE ARE FIVE CIVIL ACTIONS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF NEW YORK RELATING TO THE FUNDS. THREE OF THESE ACTIONS INVOLVE DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS BROUGHT ON

BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE TWO U.S. FEEDER FUNDS. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE

ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE BEAR STEARNS DEFENDANTS MISMANAGED THE FUNDS AND MADE MATERIAL

MISREPRESENTATIONS TO AND/OR WITHHELD INFORMATION FROM INVESTORS IN THE FUNDS. THESE ACTIONS SEEK,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BASED ON ALLEGED INVESTOR LOSSES. A FOURTH

ACTION, BROUGHT BY THE JOINT VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATORS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS FEEDER FUNDS, MAKES

ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE ASSERTED IN THE DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS RELATED TO THE U.S. FEEDER FUNDS,

AND SEEKS COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. A MOTION TO DISMISS OR ALTERNATIVELY TO STAY IS

PENDING IN ONE OF THE DERIVATIVE SUITS RELATING TO ONE OF THE U.S. FEEDER FUNDS. IN THE REMAINING

THREE CASES, MOTIONS TO DISMISS HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, AND DISCOVERY IS

ONGOING THE FIFTH ACTION WAS BROUGHT BY BANK OF AMERICA AND BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC

(TOGETHER BOFA) ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT AND FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH A MAY 2007 $4 BILLION

SECURITIZATION, KNOWN AS A CDO-SQUARED, FOR WHICH BSAM SERVED AS COLLATERAL MANAGER. THIS

SECURITIZATION WAS COMPOSED OF CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION (CDO) HOLDINGS THAT WERE

PURCHASED BY BOFA FROM THE HIGH GRADE FUND AND THE ENHANCED LEVERAGE FUND. DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS IN THIS ACTION WAS LARGELY DENIED; AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED; AND DISCOVERY IS ONGOING

IN THIS CASE AS WELL.

RALPH CIOFFI AND MATTHEW TANNIN, THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS FOR THE FUNDS, WERE TRIED ON CRIMINAL

CHARGES OF SECURITIES FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SECURITIES AND WIRE FRAUD BROUGHT BY THE

UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE

CONTENDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT CIOFFI AND TANNIN MADE MISREPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE FUNDS

PERFORMANCE, PROSPECTS AND LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS THEIR PERSONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE FUNDS. ON

NOVEMBER 10, 2009, AFTER A FIVE-WEEK TRIAL, THE JURY FOUND CIOFFI AND TANNIN NOT GUILTY OF ALL

CHARGES SUBMITTED TO THE JURY. THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS PROCEEDING

WITH ITS ACTION AGAINST CIOFFI AND TANNIN.

MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES INVESTIGATIONS AND ANTITRUST LITIGATION.

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICES

ANTITRUST DIVISION AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING JPMORGAN

CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS FOR POSSIBLE ANTITRUST AND SECURITIES VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

BIDDING OR SALE OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND DERIVATIVES TO MUNICIPAL ISSUERS. ALTHOUGH

THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS TO DATE HAS BEEN THE PERIOD 2001 TO 2005, THE

INVESTIGATIONS MAY ALSO INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS BEYOND THAT PERIOD. A GROUP OF STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) HAVE OPENED INVESTIGATIONS INTO

THE SAME UNDERLYING CONDUCT. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS BEEN COOPERATING WITH ALL OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICE OF THE SEC PROVIDED NOTICE TO JPMORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMSI)

THAT IT

INTENDS TO RECOMMEND THAT THE SEC BRING CIVIL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATIONS. JPMSI

HAS RESPONDED TO THAT NOTICE, AS WELL AS TO A SEPARATE NOTICE THAT THAT PHILADEPHIA OFFICE PROVIDED

TO BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC.

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS (THE MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES ACTIONS) HAVE

BEEN FILED AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVIDERS AND

BROKERS, ALLEGING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS IN THE MARKETS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO

MUNICIPAL BOND OFFERINGS REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES. THE MUNICIPAL

DERIVATIVES ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND DEFENDANTS HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT.

THE COURT HAS STAYED DISCOVERY PENDING DISPOSITION OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS

ASSERTING CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA STATE LAW DECLINED TO JOIN IN

THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS AND HAVE FILED SEPARATE COMPLAINTS, WHICH DEFENDANTS HAVE

ALSO MOVED TO DISMISS.

ON NOVEMBER 4, 2009, JPMSI CONSENTED TO THE ENTRY OF AN SEC ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER FINDING THAT JPMSI

VIOLATED SECTIONS 17(A)(2) AND (3) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECTION 15B(C)(1) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES RULEMAKING BOARD RULE G-17 IN CONNECTION

WITH CERTAIN JEFFERSON COUNTY, ALABAMA (THE COUNTY) BOND UNDERWRITINGS AND RELATED SWAP

TRANSACTIONS IN 2002 AND 2003 BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE IN CONFIRMATIONS AND OFFICIAL DEAL DOCUMENTS

DESCRIPTIONS OF PAYMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO MOSTLY LOCAL ALABAMA BUSINESSES AT THE DIRECTION OF

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION. JPMSI ENTERED INTO THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC

WITHOUT ADMITTING OR DENYING THE SECS FINDINGS SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE COUNTY FILED A COMPLAINT

AGAINST THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, ALABAMA.

THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE FIRM MADE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH IT WAS

CHOSEN TO UNDERWRITE WARRANTS ISSUED BY THE COUNTY AND CHOSEN AS THE COUNTERPARTY FOR CERTAIN SWAPS

EXECUTED BY THE COUNTY. IN ITS COMPLAINT, JEFFERSON COUNTY ALLEGES THAT JPMSI CONCEALED THESE THIRD

PARTY PAYMENTS AND THAT, BUT FOR THIS CONCEALMENT, THE COUNTY WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THE

TRANSACTIONS. THE COUNTY FURTHER ALLEGES THAT THE TRANSACTIONS INCREASED THE RISKS OF ITS CAPITAL

STRUCTURE AND THAT, FOLLOWING THE DOWNGRADE OF CERTAIN INSURERS THAT INSURED THE WARRANTS, THE

COUNTYS INTEREST OBLIGATIONS INCREASED AND THE PRINCIPAL DUE ON A PORTION OF ITS OUTSTANDING

WARRANTS WAS ACCELERATED. THE FIRM HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COUNTYS COMPLAINT.

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION WAS FILED ON BEHALF OF SEWER RATEPAYERS AGAINST THE FIRM AND NUMEROUS OTHER

DEFENDANTS, BASED ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE (THE WILSON ACTION). THE FIRM

MOVED TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR LACK OF STANDING. THE PLAINTIFF IN THE WILSON ACTION RECENTLY FILED

A FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH THE FIRM ALSO MOVED TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF STANDING. BOTH MOTIONS

REMAIN PENDING.

THE ALABAMA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE AUTHORITY (APSCA) BROUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA CLAIMING THAT CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE SWAPTION TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH JPMORGAN

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHASE BANK, N.A. (CHASE) ARE VOID ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE APSCA PURPORTEDLY DID NOT HAVE THE

AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, ARE VOIDABLE AT THE APSCAS OPTION BECAUSE

OF ITS ALLEGED INABILITY TO ISSUE REFUNDING BONDS IN RELATION TO THE SWAPTION. FOLLOWING THE DENIAL

OF ITS MOTION TO DISMISS THE ACTION, CHASE ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT AND FILED A COUNTERCLAIM SEEKING

THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SWAPTION TRANSACTIONS. DISCOVERY IS UNDER WAY.

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION.

A GROUP OF MERCHANTS HAVE FILED A SERIES OF PUTATIVIE CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINTS IN SEVERAL FEDERAL COURTS. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD, AS WELL AS

CERTAIN OTHER BANKS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING CHASE BANK USA, N.A.,

AND JPMORGAN CHASE, CONSPIRED TO SET THE PRICE OF CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ENACTED

RESPECTIVE ASSOCIATION RULES IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT, AND ENGAGED IN

TYING/BUNDLING AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING. ALL CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT EXTENDED THE CLAIMS BEYOND CREDIT TO DEBIT CARDS. DEFENDANTS

FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS THAT PREDATED JANUARY 1, 2004. THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO

DISMISS THESE CLAIMS. PLAINTIFFS THEN FILED A SECOND AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT.

THE BASIC THEORIES OF THE COMPLAINT REMAIN THE SAME, AND DEFENDANTS AGAIN FILED MOTIONS TO DISMISS.

THE COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON THE MOTIONS. FACT DISCOVERY HAS CLOSED, AND EXPERT DISCOVERY IN THE

CASE IS ONGOING. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A MOTION SEEKING CLASS CERTIFICATION, AND THE DEFENDANTS

HAVE OPPOSED THAT MOTION. THE COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON THE CLASS CERTIFICATION MOTION.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, PLAINTIFFS FILED SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINTS

PART I

A HERITAGE BEAR STEARNS SUBSIDIARY IS A DEFENDANT IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION THAT IS PENDING IN

FEDERAL COURT IN NEW MEXICO AGAINST A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVED AS DEPOSITORS

AND/OR UNDERWRITERS FOR 10 MBS OFFERINGS ISSUED BY THORNBURG MORTGAGE, A BANKRUPT MORTGAGE

ORIGINATOR.

THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER HERITAGE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN SUED IN OTHER PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS FOR

THEIR ROLES AN UNDERWRITER OR DEPOSITOR OF THIRD PARTY MBS OFFERINGS BUT, OTHER THAN THE MATTERS

DESCRIBED IN THE ABOVE TWO PARAGRAPHS, THE FIRM IS INDEMNIFIED IN THESE OTHER LITIGATIONS.

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MARCH 2008, SEVERAL REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS OF A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM,

CONCERNING POSSIBLE STATE AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THE MARKET FOR MANY SUCH SECURITIES HAD FROZEN AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

AUCTIONS FOR THOSE SECURITIES BEGAN TO FAIL IN FEBRUARY 2008.

THE FIRM, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND AFFILIATES, AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE NEW YORK

ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE WHICH PROVIDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE FIRM WOULD OFFER TO PURCHASE

AT PAR CERTAIN AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES PURCHASED FROM J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC., CHASE INVESTMENT

SERVICES CORP. AND BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC. BY INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, CHARITIES, AND SMALL- TO

MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THE FIRM ALSO AGREED TO A SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE

WITH THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES

ADMINISTRATOR ASSOCIATION (NASAA) TASK FORCE, WHICH AGREED TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE

SETTLEMENT TO ALL REMAINING STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE FIRM FINALIZED THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL

REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PENALTIES

TOTALING $25 MILLION TO ALL STATES. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING CONSENT

AGREEMENTS WITH NASAAS MEMBER STATES. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THESE CONSENT AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN

FINALIZED TO DATE.

THE FIRM IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A PUTATIVE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS AND LAWSUITS IN

VARIOUS FORUMS, BROUGHT BY INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, RELATING TO THE FIRMS SALES OF

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. ONE ACTION IS BROUGHT BY AN ISSUER OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THE ACTIONS

GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM AND OTHER FIRMS MANIPULATED THE MARKET FOR AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES

BY PLACING BIDS AT AUCTIONS THAT AFFECTED THESE SECURITIES CLEARING RATES OR OTHERWISE SUPPORTED

THE AUCTIONS WITHOUT PROPERLY DISCLOSING THESE ACTIVITIES. SOME ACTIONS ALSO ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM

MISREPRESENTED THAT AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES WERE SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN

AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT, AND DEFENDANTS RESPONSES TO THE COMPLAINT ARE DUE ON MARCH 3,

2010.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM WAS NAMED IN TWO PUTATIVE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, WHICH ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM, IN

COLLUSION WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEFENDANTS, ENTERED INTO AN UNLAWFUL CONSPIRACY

IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT.

SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS

ACTED COLLUSIVELY TO MAINTAIN AND STABILIZE THE AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES MARKET AND SIMILARLY ACTED

COLLUSIVELY IN WITHDRAWING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES MARKET IN FEBRUARY 2008.

ON JANUARY 26, 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED BOTH ACTIONS. THE TIME TO FILE AN APPEAL HAS NOT

YET EXPIRED.

CITY OF MILAN LITIGATION AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE CITY OF MILAN, ITALY (THE

CITY) ISSUED CIVIL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST (AMONG OTHERS) JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMCB) AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD. (JPMSL) (TOGETHER, JPM) IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF

MILAN. THE PROCEEDINGS RELATE TO A (A) A BOND ISSUE BY THE CITY IN JUNE 2005 (THE BOND) AND (B)

AN ASSOCIATED SWAP TRANSACTION, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RESTRUCTURED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS

BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007 (THE SWAP). THE CITY SEEKS DAMAGES AND/OR OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST JPM (AMONG

OTHERS) ON THE GROUNDS OF ALLEGED FRAUDULENT AND DECEITFUL ACTS AND ALLEGED BREACH OF ADVISORY

OBLIGATIONS BY JPM (AMONG OTHERS) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SWAP AND THE BOND, TOGETHER WITH RELATED

SWAP TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE. NO TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN

SET. IN JANUARY 2009, JPMCB ALSO RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM THE PROSECUTOR AT THE COURT OF MILAN

PLACING IT AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER JPM PERSONNEL UNDER INVESTIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ABOVE TRANSACTIONS. SINCE APRIL 2009, JPMCB HAS BEEN CONTESTING AN ATTACHMENT ORDER OBTAINED BY THE

PROSECUTOR, PURPORTEDLY TO FREEZE ASSETS POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO CONFISCATION IN THE EVENT OF A

CONVICTION. THE ORIGINAL EURO 92 MILLION ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO EURO 44.9 MILLION, AND

JMPCBS APPLICATION FOR A FURTHER REDUCTION REMAINS PENDING. IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE PROSECUTOR FILED

A REQUEST TO PROCEED TO TRIAL IN RESPECT OF THE ABOVE TRANSACTIONS AGAINST (A) FOUR CURRENT AND

FORMER JPM PERSONNEL AND (B) JPMCB FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY UNDER ITALIAN LAW 231/2001 IN

RESPECT OF ALLEGED CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE PERSONNEL. THE PRELIMINARY HEARING AT WHICH THESE

REQUESTS WILL BE DETERMINED BEGAN IN JANUARY 2010 AND CONTINUES, WITH FURTHER HEARING DATES

SCHEDULED. THE SANCTIONS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE IMPOSED UNDER ITALIAN LAW 231/2001 INCLUDE

MONETARY PENALTIES AND RESTRICTIONS ON CONDUCT OF JPMCBS BUSINESS IN THE JURISDICTION.

WASHINGTON MUTUAL LITIGATIONS.

SUBSEQUENT TO JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITION FROM THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS AND CERTAIN SPECIFIED LIABILITIES

OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK, HENDERSON NEVADA (WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK), ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2008,

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. (WMI) AND ITS

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, WMI INVESTMENT CORP. (TOGETHER, THE DEBTORS) BOTH COMMENCED VOLUNTARY

CASES UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (THE BANKRUPTCY CASE). IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE, THE DEBTORS HAVE

ASSERTED RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN CERTAIN ASSETS. THE ASSETS IN DISPUTE INCLUDE PRINCIPALLY THE

FOLLOWING: (A) APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN SECURITIES CONTRIBUTED BY WMI TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK;

(B) THE RIGHT TO TAX REFUNDS ARISING FROM OVERPAYMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON

MUTUAL BANK AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES; (C) OWNERSHIP OF AND OTHER RIGHTS IN APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MUTUAL BANK AND ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES; AND (D) OWNERSHIP OF AND RIGHTS IN VARIOUS OTHER CONTRACTS

AND OTHER ASSETS (COLLECTIVELY, THE DISPUTED ASSETS).

JPMORGAN CHASE COMMENCED AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AGAINST THE DEBTORS AND

(FOR INTERPLEADER PURPOSES ONLY) THE FDIC SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND OTHER RELIEF

DETERMINING JPMORGAN CHASES LEGAL TITLE TO AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE DISPUTED ASSETS.

DISCOVERY IS UNDERWAY IN THE JPMORGAN CHASE ADVERSARY PROCEEDING.

THE DEBTORS COMMENCED A SEPARATE ADVERSARY PROCEEDING IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AGAINST JPMORGAN

CHASE, SEEKING TURNOVER OF THE SAME $4 BILLION IN PURPORTED DEPOSIT FUNDS AND RECOVERY FOR ALLEGED

UNJUST ENRICHMENT FOR FAILURE TO TURN OVER THE FUNDS. THE DEBTORS HAVE MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

IN THE TURNOVER PROCEEDING. DISCOVERY IS UNDER WAY IN THE TURNOVER PROCEEDING.

IN BOTH JPMORGAN CHASES ADVERSARY PROCEEDING AND THE DEBTORS TURNOVER PROCEEDING, JPMORGAN CHASE

AND THE FDIC HAVE ARGUED THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT LACKS JURISDICTION TO ADJUDICATE CERTAIN CLAIMS.

JPMORGAN CHASE MOVED TO HAVE THE ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS TRANSFERRED TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND TO WITHDRAW JURISDICTION FROM THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO THE DISTRICT

COURT. THAT MOTION IS FULLY BRIEFED. IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC FILED PAPERS WITH THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE APPEALING THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS RULINGS

REJECTING THE JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENTS, AND THAT APPEAL IS FULLY BRIEFED. JPMORGAN CHASE IS ALSO

APPEALING A SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY COURT DECISION HOLDING, IN PART, THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT COULD

PROCEED WITH CERTAIN MATTERS WHILE THE FIRST APPEAL IS PENDING. BRIEFING ON THAT APPEAL IS UNDER

WAY.

THE DEBTORS SUBMITTED CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE SUBMITTED IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN

THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN DISPUTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS

CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK WERE SOLD BY THE FDIC TO JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FDIC, AS RECEIVER, DISALLOWED

THE DEBTORS CLAIMS AND THE DEBTORS FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE FDIC IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHALLENGING THE FDICS DISALLOWANCE OF THE DEBTORS CLAIMS,

CLAIMING OWNERSHIP OF THE DISPUTED ASSETS, AND SEEKING MONEY DAMAGES FROM THE FDIC. JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS INTERVENED IN THE ACTION. ON JANUARY 7, 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT STAYED THE ACTION PENDING

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND ORDERED THE PARTIES TO SUBMIT A JOINT STATUS REPORT EVERY

120 DAYS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE STAY, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED WMIS AND THE FDICS MOTIONS TO

DISMISS WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

IN ADDITION, THE DEBTORS MOVED IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO TAKE DISCOVERY FROM JPMORGAN CHASE

PURPORTEDLY RELATED TO A LITIGATION ORIGINALLY FILED IN THE 122ND STATE DISTRICT COURT OF GALVESTON

COUNTY, TEXAS (THE TEXAS ACTION). JPMORGAN CHASE OPPOSED THE MOTION, BUT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

ORDERED THAT THE DISCOVERY PROCEED. DEBTORS ARE ALSO SEEKING RELATED DISCOVERY FROM VARIOUS THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING SEVERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. PLAINTIFFS IN THE TEXAS ACTION ARE CERTAIN HOLDERS

OF WMI COMMON STOCK AND THE DEBT OF WMI AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK WHO HAVE SUED JPMORGAN CHASE FOR

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ALLEGING THAT JPMORGAN

CHASE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK FROM THE FDIC AT AN ALLEGEDLY TOO LOW PRICE. THE FDIC INTERVENED IN THE

TEXAS ACTION, HAD IT REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

TEXAS, AND THEN THE FDIC AND JPMORGAN CHASE MOVED TO HAVE THE TEXAS ACTION DISMISSED OR

TRANSFERRED. THE COURT TRANSFERRED THE TEXAS ACTION TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. PLAINTIFFS HAVE

MOVED TO HAVE THE FDIC DISMISSED AS A PARTY AND TO REMAND THE ACTION TO THE STATE COURT, OR, IN THE

ALTERNATIVE, DISMISSED FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION. JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC HAVE

MOVED TO HAVE THE ENTIRE ACTION DISMISSED. THE MOTIONS TO DISMISS ARE FULLY BRIEFED.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUALS FAILURE ALSO PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA INCLUDE A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL

TRUST COMPANY AGAINST THE FDIC ALLEGING BREACH OF VARIOUS MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS AND

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN BY CERTAIN WMI SUBSIDIARIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THOSE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS NOT BEEN NAMED A PARTY TO THE

DEUTSCHE BANK LITIGATION, BUT THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES ASSERTIONS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY HAVE

ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES.

SECURITIES LENDING LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N.A. (JPMORGAN) HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT

IN FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS ASSERTING ERISA AND NON-ERISA CLAIMS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK RELATED TO THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING

BUSINESS. THREE OF THE PENDING ACTIONS RELATE TO LOSSES OF PLAINTIFFS MONEY (I.E., CASH COLLATERAL

FOR SECURITIES LOAN TRANSACTIONS) IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES OF A STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLE KNOWN AS

SIGMA FINANCE INC. (SIGMA). THE FOURTH ACTION CONCERNS LOSSES OF MONEY INVESTED IN LEHMAN

BROTHERS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, AS WELL AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES OFFERED BY NINE OTHER ISSUERS.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LITIGATION.

FOUR CASES HAVE BEEN FILED CLAIMING THAT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS

MANAGED BY JPMORGAN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC. (JPMIM) WERE INAPPROPRIATELY INVESTED IN

SECURITIES BACKED BY SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL. PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT JPMIM AND

RELATED DEFENDANTS ARE LIABLE FOR THE LOSS IN MARKET VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES. THE FIRST CASE WAS

FILED BY NM HOMES ONE, INC. IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK. THE SECOND CASE, FILED BY ASSURED

GUARANTY (U.K.) IN NEW YORK STATE COURT, WAS DISMISSED AND ASSURED HAS APPEALED THE COURTS

DECISION. THE THIRD CASE WAS FILED BY AMBAC ASSURANCE UK LIMITED IN NEW YORK STATE COURT AND

JPMIMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT IS PENDING. THE FOURTH CASE WAS FILED BY CMMF LLP IN NEW

YORK STATE COURT IN DECEMBER 2009; THE COURT GRANTED JPMIMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS, OTHER

THAN CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AND MISREPRESENTATION. BOTH CMMF AND JPMIM HAVE FILED NOTICES OF

APPEAL.

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL

LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF ITS BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENRON CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (ENRON).

A NUMBER OF ACTIONS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE FIRM HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, INCLUDING A CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT CAPTIONED

NEWBY V. ENRON CORP.

AND ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY ENRONS

BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. THE REMAINING ENRON-RELATED ACTIONS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS BY ENRON

INVESTORS, CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

THE REMAINING LITIGATION ALSO INCLUDES A SUIT AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE ALLEGING, IN RELEVANT PART,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BASED UPON THE FIRMS ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE IN

CONNECTION WITH AN INDENTURE AGREEMENT BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND ENRON. THE CASE HAS BEEN

DISMISSED, BUT PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE DISMISSAL AND THEIR APPEAL IS PENDING BEFORE THE NEW

YORK STATE COURT OF APPEALS.

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRMS 401(K)

PLAN ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) FOR ALLEGED

BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND NEGLIGENCE BY JPMORGAN CHASE, ITS DIRECTORS AND NAMED OFFICERS.

PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THE FIRMS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS ARE

BOTH FULLY BRIEFED.

IPO ALLOCATION LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SECURITIES SUBSIDIARIES WERE NAMED,

ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF NEW YORK ALLEGING IMPROPRIETIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALLOCATION OF SECURITIES IN VARIOUS

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, INCLUDING SOME OFFERINGS FOR WHICH A JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY SERVED AS AN

UNDERWRITER. THEY ALSO CLAIM VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES LAWS ARISING FROM ALLEGED MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS IN REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND PROSPECTUSES FOR THE INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS (IPOS) AND ALLEGED MARKET MANIPULATION WITH RESPECT TO AFTERMARKET TRANSACTIONS IN THE

OFFERED SECURITIES. BEAR, STEARNS & CO., INC. IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A LITTLE LESS THAN A THIRD

OF THE PENDING IPO SECURITIES CASES. ANTITRUST LAWSUITS BASED ON SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN

DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. A SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED IN THE SECURITIES CASES, WHICH THE DISTRICT

COURT APPROVED; THE FIRMS SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT IS

APPROXIMATELY $62 MILLION. APPEALS AND A

PETITION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT SEEKING REVERSAL OF THE DECISION APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL

ACTIONS, INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW OF

THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE

CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL

THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT

STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING

OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES, PENALTIES OR

IMPACT RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION

RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING

AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ACTIONS AND

INVESTIGATIONS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD,

DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF

JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID ON APRIL 30, 2009, TO SHAREHOLDERS

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED ON

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY

NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE,

LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES  OR EVEN MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES  IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE. SEE PAGE 136 FOR MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO

MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTED 2009 NET INCOME OF $11.7 BILLION, OR $2.26 PER SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET

INCOME OF $5.6 BILLION, OR $1.35 PER SHARE, IN 2008. TOTAL NET REVENUE IN 2009 WAS $100.4 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $67.3 BILLION IN 2008. RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 6% IN 2009 AND 4% IN 2008. RESULTS

BENEFITED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

(WASHINGTON MUTUAL) ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER WITH THE BEAR STEARNS

COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) ON MAY 30, 2008.

THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY RECORD NET REVENUE, INCLUDING RECORD REVENUE

IN THE INVESTMENT BANK REFLECTING MODEST NET GAINS ON LEGACY LEVERAGED-LENDING AND MORTGAGE-RELATED

POSITIONS COMPARED WITH NET MARKDOWNS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE GROWTH IN THE

FIRMS REVENUE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE

CONSUMER PROVISION, AND HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN

2009 GRADUALLY IMPROVED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE YEAR BEGAN WITH A CONTINUATION

OF THE WEAK CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 - THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTRACTED SHARPLY

IN THE FIRST QUARTER, LABOR MARKETS DETERIORATED RAPIDLY AND UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE, CREDIT

WAS TIGHT, LIQUIDITY WAS DIMINISHED, AND BUSINESSES CONTINUED TO DOWNSIZE AND CUT

INVENTORY LEVELS RAPIDLY. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THE BOARD OF

GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE) TOOK ACTIONS

TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND PROMOTE AN ECONOMIC REVIVAL. IT HELD ITS

POLICY RATE CLOSE TO ZERO AND INDICATED THAT THIS POLICY WAS LIKELY TO REMAIN IN

PLACE FOR SOME TIME, GIVEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, IT GREATLY EXPANDED

A PROGRAM IT LAUNCHED AT THE END OF 2008, WITH A PLAN TO BUY UP TO $1.7 TRILLION

OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING TREASURY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND

OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AGENCIES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND VARIOUS

REGULATORS CONTINUED THEIR EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE U.S. ECONOMY, PUTTING IN PLACE

A FINANCIAL RESCUE PLAN THAT SUPPLEMENTED THE INTEREST RATE AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT

HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (THE U.S. TREASURY)

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008. THESE EFFORTS BEGAN TO TAKE EFFECT DURING 2009. DEVELOPING

ECONOMIES REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY AND CONTRACTION IN DEVELOPED ECONOMIES SLOWED. CREDIT

CONDITIONS IMPROVED IN THE SUMMER, WITH MOST CREDIT SPREADS NARROWING DRAMATICALLY.

BY THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR, MANY SPREADS HAD RETURNED TO PRE-CRISIS LEVELS. BY

THE FOURTH QUARTER, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WAS EXPANDING AND SIGNS EMERGED THAT THE DETERIORATION IN THE LABOR MARKET WAS ABATING, ALTHOUGH BY THE END OF THE YEAR UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED 10%, ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 1983. THE HOUSING SECTOR SHOWED SOME SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT AND HOUSEHOLD SPENDING APPEARED TO BE EXPANDING AT A MODERATE RATE, THOUGH IT REMAINED CONSTRAINED BY A WEAK LABOR MARKET, MODEST INCOME GROWTH, LOWER HOUSING WEALTH, AND TIGHT CREDIT. BUSINESSES WERE CONTINUING TO REDUCE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, THOUGH AT A SLOWER PACE, AND REMAINED RELUCTANT TO ADD TO PAYROLLS. FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BECAME MORE SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH.

AMIDST THIS DIFFICULT

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, JPMORGAN CHASE BENEFITED FROM THE DIVERSITY OF ITS LEADING

FRANCHISES, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE CONTINUED EARNINGS STRENGTH OF ITS INVESTMENT

BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, AND RETAIL BANKING FRANCHISES. SIGNIFICANT

MARKET SHARE AND EFFICIENCY GAINS HELPED ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP

POSITIONS: THE INVESTMENT BANK RANKED #1 FOR GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING FEES FOR 2009;

IN COMMERCIAL BANKING, AT YEAR-END 2009, THE TOTAL REVENUE RELATED TO INVESTMENT

BANKING PRODUCTS SOLD TO CB CLIENTS DOUBLED FROM ITS LEVEL AT THE TIME OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE-BANK ONE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM COMPLETED THE INTEGRATION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND CONTINUED TO INVEST IN ITS BUSINESSES,

DEMONSTRATED BY GROWTH IN CHECKING AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.

THROUGHOUT 2009, THE FIRM REMAINED FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET. IN ADDITION TO

THE CAPITAL GENERATED FROM EARNINGS, THE FIRM ISSUED $5.8 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK AND REDUCED ITS

QUARTERLY DIVIDEND. THE FIRM ALSO INCREASED ITS CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BY $7.8

BILLION, BRINGING THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO $32.5 BILLION, OR 5.5% OF TOTAL LOANS.

THE FIRM RECORDED A $1.1 BILLION ONE-TIME NONCASH ADJUSTMENT TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY RELATED

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TO THE REDEMPTION OF THE $25.0 BILLION OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY

UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. EVEN WITH THIS ADJUSTMENT, THE FIRM ENDED 2009 WITH A VERY

STRONG TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 11.1% AND A TIER 1 COMMON RATIO OF 8.8%.

THROUGHOUT THIS TURBULENT FINANCIAL PERIOD, JPMORGAN CHASE SUPPORTED AND SERVED ITS 90 MILLION

CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES; DELIVERED CONSUMER-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AND

POLICIES; AND CONTINUED TO LEND. THE FIRM EXTENDED NEARLY $250 BILLION IN NEW CREDIT TO CONSUMERS

DURING THE YEAR AND FOR ITS CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL CLIENTS, EITHER LENT OR ASSISTED THEM IN

RAISING APPROXIMATELY $1 TRILLION IN LOANS, STOCKS OR BONDS. THE FIRM ALSO REMAINED COMMITTED TO

HELPING HOMEOWNERS MEET THE CHALLENGES OF DECLINING HOME PRICES AND RISING UNEMPLOYMENT. SINCE

2007, THE FIRM HAS INITIATED OVER 900,000 ACTIONS TO PREVENT FORECLOSURES THROUGH ITS OWN PROGRAMS

AND THROUGH GOVERNMENT MORTGAGE-MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. DURING 2009 ALONE, JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERED

APPROXIMATELY 600,000 LOAN MODIFICATIONS TO STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS. OF THESE, 89,000 LOANS HAVE

ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION. BY MARCH 31, 2010, THE FIRM WILL HAVE OPENED 51 CHASE

HOMEOWNERSHIP CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALREADY HAS OVER 14,000 EMPLOYEES DEDICATED TO

MORTGAGE LOSS MITIGATION.

MANAGEMENT REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT JPMORGAN CHASES CAPITAL AND RESERVE STRENGTH, COMBINED WITH ITS

SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS POWER, WILL ALLOW THE FIRM TO MEET THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT LIE AHEAD AND STILL

CONTINUE INVESTING IN ITS BUSINESSES AND SERVING ITS CLIENTS AND SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE LONG TERM.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR AND PRESENTS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. FOR MORE INFORMATION

ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES ON PAGES 5052 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INVESTMENT BANK

REPORTED RECORD NET INCOME IN 2009 COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS IN

2008. THE SIGNIFICANT REBOUND IN EARNINGS WAS DRIVEN BY RECORD NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN BOTH NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN NET

REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY RECORD FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE, REFLECTING STRONG RESULTS ACROSS MOST

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS MODEST NET GAINS ON LEGACY LEVERAGED LENDING AND MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS,

COMPARED WITH OVER $10 BILLION OF NET MARKDOWNS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES ROSE TO

RECORD LEVELS, AS HIGHER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVISORY

FEES. RECORD EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY SOLID CLIENT REVENUE, PARTICULARLY IN PRIME

SERVICES, AND STRONG TRADING RESULTS. THE NET REVENUE RESULTS FOR IB IN 2009 INCLUDED LOSSES FROM

THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES,

COMPARED WITH GAINS IN 2008 FROM THE WIDENING OF THE SPREAD ON THOSE LIABILITIES. THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IB ENDED THE YEAR

WITH A RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO END-OF-PERIOD LOANS RETAINED OF 8.25%. NONINTEREST

EXPENSE INCREASED, REFLECTING HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER

HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH

IN NET REVENUE. HIGHER NET REVENUE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WIDER

LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS, AND HIGHER NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND HOUSING PRICE DECLINES

CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. RFS

ENDED THE YEAR WITH A RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO ENDING LOANS, EXCLUDING PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS OF 5.09%. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS HIGHER, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER SERVICING AND DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE.

CARD SERVICES

REPORTED A NET LOSS FOR THE YEAR, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME IN 2008. THE DECLINE WAS

DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET

REVENUE. THE DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN MANAGED NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE RELATED TO THE

DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE; THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS, A DECREASED LEVEL OF FEES AND LOWER AVERAGE

LOAN BALANCES. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. CS ENDED THE YEAR WITH A RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO END-OF-PERIOD

LOANS OF 12.28%. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM 2008, AS AN INCREASE IN PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND

HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE. DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN

NET REVENUE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND RECORD LEVELS OF LENDING-

AND DEPOSIT-RELATED AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. REVENUE ROSE IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS: MIDDLE

MARKET BANKING, COMMERCIAL TERM LENDING, MID-CORPORATE BANKING AND REAL ESTATE BANKING. THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN THE

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT ACROSS ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY IN

REAL ESTATERELATED SEGMENTS. CB

ENDED THE YEAR WITH A RATIO OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO END-OF-PERIOD LOANS RETAINED OF 3.12%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) INSURANCE PREMIUMS.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES

NET INCOME DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

LOWER NET REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE REFLECTED LOWER WORLDWIDE SECURITIES SERVICES NET

REVENUE, DRIVEN BY LOWER BALANCES AND SPREADS ON LIABILITY PRODUCTS; LOWER SECURITIES LENDING

BALANCES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DECLINES IN ASSET VALUATIONS AND DEMAND; AND THE EFFECT OF

MARKET DEPRECIATION ON CERTAIN CUSTODY ASSETS. TREASURY SERVICES NET REVENUE ALSO DECLINED,

REFLECTING LOWER DEPOSIT BALANCES AND SPREADS, OFFSET BY HIGHER TRADE REVENUE DRIVEN BY WIDER

SPREADS AND GROWTH ACROSS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CARD PRODUCT VOLUMES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE ROSE

SLIGHTLY COMPARED

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS OFFSET BY LOWER

HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUE, OFFSET

LARGELY BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN NET

REVENUE REFLECTED HIGHER VALUATIONS OF THE FIRMS SEED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, NET INFLOWS, WIDER LOAN

SPREADS AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET LEVELS AND

NARROWER DEPOSIT SPREADS. ASSET MANAGEMENTS BUSINESSES REPORTED MIXED REVENUE RESULTS.

INSTITUTIONAL AND PRIVATE BANK REVENUE WERE UP WHILE RETAIL AND PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT REVENUE

WERE DOWN. ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED FOR THE YEAR, DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET

VALUATIONS AND INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY OUTFLOWS IN CASH

PRODUCTS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS HIGHER, REFLECTING THE EFFECT

OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND HIGHER FDIC INSURANCE

PREMIUMS, OFFSET LARGELY BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

NET INCOME INCREASED IN 2009, REFLECTING ELEVATED LEVELS OF TRADING GAINS

AND NET INTEREST INCOME, SECURITIES GAINS, AN AFTER-TAX GAIN FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES AND

REDUCED LOSSES FROM PRIVATE EQUITY COMPARED WITH 2008. TRADING GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME

INCREASED DUE TO THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND

OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS WERE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICES MANAGEMENT OF

INTEREST RATE RISK AND INVESTMENT OF CASH RESULTING FROM THE EXCESS FUNDING THE FIRM CONTINUED TO

EXPERIENCE DURING 2009. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF HIGHER-COUPON

INSTRUMENTS (PART OF REPOSITIONING THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO) AS WELL AS PREPAYMENTS AND MATURITIES.

FIRMWIDE

, THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $38.5 BILLION, UP BY $13.9 BILLION, OR 56%,

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED A $1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM WASHINGTON MUTUALS

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH AFFECTED BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE

PURPOSES OF THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, THIS CHARGE IS EXCLUDED. THE CONSUMER-MANAGED PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS $34.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $20.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE HOME LENDING AND CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

CONSUMER-MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $26.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $13.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

RESULTING IN MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATES OF 5.85% AND 3.22%, RESPECTIVELY. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT 2009. WHOLESALE NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $3.1

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $402 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING IN NET CHARGE-OFF RATES OF 1.40%

AND 0.18%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRMS NONPERFORMING ASSETS TOTALED $19.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, UP FROM $12.7 BILLION. THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED BY $8.7 BILLION FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR-END,

RESULTING IN A LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OF 5.51%,

COMPARED WITH 3.62% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $165.4 BILLION.

2010 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE THE FIRMS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2010 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S.

ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

AND CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. EACH OF THESE LINKED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM

AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS. THE OUTLOOK FOR CAPITAL MARKETS REMAINS UNCERTAIN, AND FURTHER DECLINES IN

U.S. HOUSING PRICES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND INCREASES IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, EITHER OF WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS, ARE POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF

RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE U.S. CONGRESS AND REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON THE

REGULATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; ANY LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE ADOPTED AS A

RESULT COULD LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, AND COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM

IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH SUCH NEW LAWS OR RULES.

GIVEN THE POTENTIAL STRESS ON CONSUMERS FROM RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AND CONTINUED DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

HOUSING PRICES, MANAGEMENT REMAINS CAUTIOUS WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT OUTLOOK FOR THE CONSUMER

LOAN PORTFOLIOS. POSSIBLE CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN CREDIT TRENDS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER CREDIT COSTS

AND REQUIRE ADDITIONS TO THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. BASED ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, QUARTERLY NET CHARGE-OFFS COULD REACH $1.4 BILLION FOR THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO,

$600 MILLION FOR THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AND $500 MILLION FOR THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO

OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR CARD SERVICES (EXCLUDING THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO) COULD APPROACH 11% BY THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, INCLUDING

THE ADVERSE TIMING EFFECT OF A PAYMENT HOLIDAY PROGRAM OF APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS. THE

MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO COULD APPROACH 24% OVER

THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS. THESE CHARGE-OFF RATES ARE LIKELY TO MOVE EVEN HIGHER IF THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT DETERIORATES BEYOND MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. SIMILARLY, WHOLESALE CREDIT

COSTS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS COULD INCREASE IN THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS IF THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT

DETERIORATES.

THE INVESTMENT BANK CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN AN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT, AND AS NOTED ABOVE, RESULTS

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT WERE TO DETERIORATE FURTHER. TRADING RESULTS

CAN BE VOLATILE AND 2009 INCLUDED ELEVATED CLIENT VOLUMES AND SPREAD LEVELS. AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT

EXPECTS FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE TO NORMALIZE OVER TIME AS CONDITIONS STABILIZE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN THE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT WITHIN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT EXPECTS

UNDERLYING GROWTH, RESULTS WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND ONGOING LOWER

CONSUMER SPENDING LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS MADE CHANGES, CONSISTENT

WITH (AND IN CERTAIN RESPECTS, BEYOND) THE REQUIREMENTS OF

NEWLY-ENACTED LEGISLATION, IN ITS POLICIES RELATING TO

NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ARE, AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

PRELIMINARY AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE, SUCH CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN AN ANNUALIZED REDUCTION

IN NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010.

IN THE CONSUMER LENDING SEGMENT WITHIN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, AT CURRENT PRODUCTION AND

ESTIMATED RUN-OFF LEVELS, THE HOME LENDING PORTFOLIO OF $263 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IS

EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 1015% AND COULD POSSIBLY AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY $240 BILLION

IN 2010 AND APPROXIMATELY $200 BILLION IN 2011. BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE, WHICH

IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, THE EFFECT OF SUCH A REDUCTION IN THE HOME LENDING PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO

REDUCE 2010 NET INTEREST INCOME IN THE PORTFOLIO BY APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION FROM THE 2009 LEVEL.

ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY

ELEVATED LEVELS OF REPURCHASES OF MORTGAGES PREVIOUSLY SOLD TO, FOR

EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES.

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS NONINTEREST EXPENSE IN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REMAIN AT OR ABOVE 2009

LEVELS, REFLECTING INVESTMENTS IN NEW BRANCH BUILDS AND SALES FORCE HIRES AS WELL AS CONTINUED

ELEVATED SERVICING, DEFAULT AND FORECLOSED ASSET RELATED COSTS.

CARD SERVICES FACES RISING CREDIT COSTS IN 2010, AS WELL AS CONTINUED PRESSURE ON BOTH CHARGE

VOLUMES AND CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES GROWTH, REFLECTING CONTINUED LOWER LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING.

IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE RECENTLY-ENACTED CREDIT CARD LEGISLATION, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES,

WHICH ARE PRELIMINARY AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE, ARE THAT CSS ANNUAL NET INCOME MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION TO $750 MILLION. FURTHER, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS AVERAGE CARD

OUTSTANDINGS TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 10-15% IN 2010 DUE TO

THE RUN-OFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO  AND LOWER BALANCE TRANSFER LEVELS. AS A RESULT

OF ALL

THESE FACTORS, MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY EXPECTS CS TO REPORT NET LOSSES IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF 2010 (OF APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT IN

THE SECOND QUARTER) BEFORE THE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL RESERVE ACTIONS. RESULTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2010 WILL

LIKELY BE DEPENDENT ON THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND POTENTIAL RESERVE ACTIONS.

COMMERCIAL BANKING RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY RISING CREDIT COSTS, A DECLINE IN LOAN

DEMAND AND REDUCED LIABILITY BALANCES.

EARNINGS IN TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF

MARKET LEVELS ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND CUSTODY. ADDITIONALLY, EARNINGS IN

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES COULD BE AFFECTED BY LIABILITY BALANCE FLOWS.

EARNINGS IN PRIVATE EQUITY (WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT) WILL LIKELY BE VOLATILE

AND CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, MARKET LEVELS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

BROADER ECONOMY AND INVESTMENT-SPECIFIC ISSUES. CORPORATES NET INTEREST INCOME LEVELS AND

SECURITIES GAINS WILL GENERALLY TREND WITH THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN CORPORATE;

HOWEVER, THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRADING GAINS IN CORPORATE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2009 IS NOT LIKELY TO

CONTINUE. IN THE NEAR-TERM, CORPORATE QUARTERLY NET INCOME (EXCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY,

MERGER-RELATED ITEMS AND ANY SIGNIFICANT NONRECURRING ITEMS) IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SIZE AND DURATION OF THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO.

LASTLY, WITH REGARD TO ANY DECISION BY THE FIRMS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS CONCERNING ANY INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF THE COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND, THEIR DETERMINATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO THEIR JUDGMENT THAT

THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS SUFFICIENTLY

DIMINISHED, THAT OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE HAS STABILIZED, AND THAT

SUCH ACTION IS WARRANTED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FIRMS EARNINGS OUTLOOK, NEED TO

MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS, ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, AND APPROPRIATE DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS. WHEN IN THE

BOARDS JUDGMENT, BASED ON THE FOREGOING, THE BOARD BELIEVES IT APPROPRIATE TO INCREASE THE DIVIDEND TO AN ANNUAL PAYOUT LEVEL IN THE RANGE OF $0.75 TO $1.00 PER SHARE, THE BOARD WOULD LIKELY MOVE FORWARD WITH SUCH AN INCREASE, AND FOLLOW AT SOME LATER TIME WITH AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE OR ADDITIONAL INCREASES SUFFICIENT TO RETURN TO THE FIRMS HISTORICAL DIVIDEND RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 30% TO 40% OF

NORMALIZED EARNINGS OVER TIME.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $100.4 BILLION, UP BY $33.2 BILLION, OR 49%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE ACROSS MOST FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, AND THE ABSENCE OF NET MARKDOWNS ON

LEGACY LEVERAGED LENDING AND MORTGAGE POSITIONS IN IB, AS WELL AS HIGHER LEVELS OF TRADING GAINS

AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCOME IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. RESULTS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME,

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AND MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME. LASTLY, HIGHER INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO REVENUE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY REDUCED FEES AND COMMISSIONS FROM THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET LEVELS ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND CUSTODY, AND THE ABSENCE OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING

FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE

IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5557 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF REVENUE FROM TRADING AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. TRADING REVENUE INCREASED,

DRIVEN BY

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ACROSS MOST FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS; MODEST NET GAINS ON LEGACY

LEVERAGED LENDING AND MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS, COMPARED WITH NET MARKDOWNS OF $10.6 BILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR; AND GAINS ON TRADING POSITIONS IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, COMPARED WITH LOSSES IN

THE PRIOR YEAR OF $1.1 BILLION ON MARKDOWNS OF FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FANNIE MAE)

AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC) PREFERRED SECURITIES. THESE INCREASES IN

REVENUE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN AGGREGATE

LOSS OF $2.3 BILLION FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE

FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $2.0

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM WIDENING SPREADS ON THESE LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES. THE FIRMS

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PRODUCED A SLIGHT NET LOSS IN 2009, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM A

LARGER NET LOSS IN 2008. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE IB AND

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5557 AND

7475, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 3 ON

PAGES 148165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND ORGANIC GROWTH IN BOTH LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES IN

RFS, CB, IB AND TSS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE

MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB, SEE THE RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 5863, THE TSS SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 6970, AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

6768 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DECLINE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM FROM THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET LEVELS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER ADMINISTRATION FEES IN TSS, DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF

MARKET DEPRECIATION ON CERTAIN CUSTODY ASSETS AND LOWER SECURITIES LENDING BALANCES; AND LOWER

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS REVENUE IN IB, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO LOWER TRANSACTION VOLUME. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR TSS ON PAGES

6970, AND AM ON PAGES 7173 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES GAINS WERE LOWER IN 2009 AND INCLUDED CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT AND LOWER GAINS ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES OF $241 MILLION IN 2009, COMPARED WITH

$668 MILLION IN 2008. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER GAINS FROM REPOSITIONING THE

CORPORATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IN CONNECTION WITH MANAGING THE FIRMS STRUCTURAL

INTEREST RATE RISK. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, SEE THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 7475 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS HIGHER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN AVERAGE THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED AS A RESULT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

AN INCREASE IN

ESTIMATED

LOSSES FROM THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY-SOLD LOANS, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY WIDER

MARGINS ON NEW ORIGINATIONS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS

RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS, SEE THE CONSUMER LENDING DISCUSSION ON PAGES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DUE TO LOWER SERVICING FEES EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH CS

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CREDIT LOSSES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY WIDER LOAN MARGINS ON SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS; HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE

RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE; AND HIGHER INTERCHANGE

INCOME. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE THE CS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 6466

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE ABSENCE OF $1.5 BILLION IN

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES DURING ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2008, AND A $1.0 BILLION GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008; AND LOWER NET SECURITIZATION INCOME IN CS. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $464 MILLION CHARGE RECOGNIZED IN 2008 RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES AT PAR; THE ABSENCE OF A $423 MILLION LOSS INCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008,

REFLECTING THE FIRMS 49.4% SHARE OF BEAR STEARNS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008; AND HIGHER

VALUATIONS ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING SEED CAPITAL IN AM.

NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER AVERAGE LOANS AND DEPOSITS. THE FIRMS INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE

$1.7 TRILLION, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS, WAS

3.12%, AN INCREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS FROM 2008. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME IN 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, AS WELL AS A WIDER NET INTEREST MARGIN, WHICH REFLECTED THE OVERALL DECLINE IN MARKET

INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR. DECLINING INTEREST RATES HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE NET INTEREST

MARGIN, AS RATES PAID ON THE FIRMS INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED FASTER RELATIVE TO THE DECLINE IN RATES EARNED ON

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. THESE INCREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER LOAN

BALANCES, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND, REPAYMENTS AND CHARGE-OFFS.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $67.3 BILLION WAS DOWN $4.1 BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE

RESULTED FROM THE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN 2008.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND INCLUDED NET MARKDOWNS ON

MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS AND LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS, LOSSES ON

PREFERRED SECURITIES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, AND LOSSES ON PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WERE LOSSES AND MARKDOWNS RECORDED IN OTHER

INCOME, INCLUDING THE FIRMS SHARE OF BEAR STEARNS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008. THESE

DECLINES WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES

IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND THE GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH JOINT

VENTURE.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE DOWN FROM THE RECORD LEVEL OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO LOWER DEBT

UNDERWRITING FEES, AS WELL AS LOWER ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE AT

RECORD LEVELS IN 2007. THESE DECLINES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED

MARKET ACTIVITY. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION

OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE IB SEGMENT RESULTS

ON PAGES 5557 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN 2008, PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECLINED BY $19.7 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TRADING

REVENUE DECREASED BY $14.5 BILLION TO A NEGATIVE $9.8 BILLION, COMPARED WITH POSITIVE $4.7 BILLION

IN 2007. THE DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY NET MARKDOWNS OF $5.9 BILLION ON

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES, COMPARED WITH $1.4 BILLION IN NET MARKDOWNS IN THE PRIOR YEAR; NET

MARKDOWNS OF $4.7 BILLION ON LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS, COMPARED WITH $1.3

BILLION IN NET MARKDOWNS IN THE PRIOR YEAR; LOSSES OF $1.1 BILLION ON PREFERRED SECURITIES OF

FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC; AND WEAKER EQUITY TRADING RESULTS, COMPARED WITH A RECORD LEVEL IN

2007. IN ADDITION, TRADING REVENUE WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL LOSSES AND COSTS TO REDUCE

RISK RELATED TO BEAR STEARNS POSITIONS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE WERE

RECORD RESULTS IN RATES AND CURRENCIES, CREDIT TRADING, COMMODITIES AND EMERGING MARKETS, AS WELL

AS STRONG EQUITY MARKETS CLIENT REVENUE; AND TOTAL GAINS OF $2.0 BILLION FROM THE WIDENING OF THE

FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES, COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION

IN 2007. PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS ALSO DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, RECORDING LOSSES

OF $908 MILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $4.3 BILLION IN 2007. IN ADDITION, THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007 INCLUDED A FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW FASB GUIDANCE ON

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE IB AND

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5557 AND

7475, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 3 ON

PAGES 148165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE FROM 2007, PREDOMINANTLY RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB, SEE THE RFS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5863, THE TSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

6970 AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS

ON PAGES 6768 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DECLINE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS

DRIVEN BY LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM, DUE TO LOWER PERFORMANCE FEES AND THE EFFECT OF LOWER

MARKET LEVELS. THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS REVENUE, RELATED

PREDOMINANTLY TO HIGHER BROKERAGE TRANSACTION VOLUME WITHIN IBS EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE, WHICH

INCLUDED ADDITIONS FROM BEAR STEARNS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS; AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATION FEES IN TSS, DRIVEN BY WIDER SPREADS IN SECURITIES LENDING AND

INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON PAGES 5557,

RFS ON PAGES 5863, TSS ON PAGES

6970 AND AM ON PAGES 7173 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES GAINS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO THE REPOSITIONING OF THE

CORPORATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, AS PART OF MANAGING THE STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK OF

THE

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIRM; AND HIGHER GAINS FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

SECURITIES GAINS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN THE FIRMS CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, SEE

THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 7475 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE, WHICH BENEFITED FROM AN IMPROVEMENT IN MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSR) RISK

MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND INCREASED LOAN SERVICING REVENUE. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE INCREASED

SLIGHTLY, AS GROWTH IN ORIGINATIONS WAS PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY MARKDOWNS ON THE MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE

AND INCREASED LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS,

SEE THE CONSUMER LENDING DISCUSSION ON PAGES 6063 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME ROSE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, DUE

TO HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME IN CS AND HIGHER DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION VOLUME IN RFS; THE IMPACT

OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION; AND INCREASED SERVICING FEES RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS

TO PARTNERS AND EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARDS PROGRAMS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD

INCOME, SEE CSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF $1.5 BILLION, THE GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF

THE CHASE PAYMENTECH JOINT VENTURE OF $1.0 BILLION, AND GAINS ON SALES OF CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS.

THESE PROCEEDS AND GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VALUATIONS ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING SEED CAPITAL IN AM; A $464 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE OFFER TO REPURCHASE AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES AT PAR; LOSSES OF $423 MILLION REFLECTING THE FIRMS 49.4% OWNERSHIP IN BEAR STEARNS

LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008; AND LOWER NET SECURITIZATION INCOME IN CS.

NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER AVERAGE LOANS AND DEPOSITS, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY

THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER. THE BEAR STEARNS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER NET

INTEREST INCOME, AS THIS BUSINESS INCREASED AVERAGE BALANCES IN OTHER INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS

(PRIMARILY CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES) AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES (PRIMARILY CUSTOMER

PAYABLES). THE FIRMS INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE $1.4 TRILLION, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE

ASSETS, ON AN FTE BASIS, WAS 2.87%, AN INCREASE OF 48 BASIS POINTS FROM 2007. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST

INCOME IN 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY A WIDER NET INTEREST MARGIN, WHICH REFLECTED THE OVERALL DECLINE IN

MARKET INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR. THE DECLINE IN RATES HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE NET

INTEREST MARGIN, AS RATES PAID ON THE FIRMS INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED FASTER RELATIVE

TO THE DECREASE IN RATES EARNED ON INTEREST-EARNING

ASSETS. GROWTH IN CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOAN

BALANCES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2009 ROSE BY $11.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED A

$1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM WASHINGTON MUTUALS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH AFFECTED BOTH

THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, THIS CHARGE IS

EXCLUDED. THE CONSUMER PROVISION REFLECTED ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HOME

EQUITY, MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS, AS WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HOUSING PRICE DECLINES

AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THESE PORTFOLIOS.

INCLUDED IN THE 2009 ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS A $1.6 BILLION PROVISION RELATED

TO ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO. THE

WHOLESALE PROVISION INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT IN 2009 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS FOR RFS ON PAGES 5863,

SECTION ON PAGES 115117 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2008 ROSE BY $14.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO

INCREASES IN BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS. THE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION

REFLECTED HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGES RESULTING FROM DECLINING HOUSING

PRICES; AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THE AUTO, STUDENT AND BUSINESS BANKING LOAN PORTFOLIOS;

AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS OF CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE

INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM A WEAKENING

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND GROWTH IN RETAINED LOANS. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2008 ALSO INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, IN 2008 BOTH

THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS WERE AFFECTED BY A $1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM ASSETS

ACQUIRED FROM WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO THE FIRMS LOAN LOSS METHODOLOGIES. FOR A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR

NOTE 13 ON PAGES 192196 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $52.4 BILLION, UP $8.9 BILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, HIGHER FDIC-RELATED COSTS AND INCREASED MORTGAGE SERVICING AND

DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE,

INCLUDING SALARY AND BENEFITS BUT EXCLUDING PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, AND OTHER NONCOMPENSATION

COSTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2009 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING

THESE TWO ITEMS, COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT,

PARTICULARLY IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES AND IN CORPORATE.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE FOLLOWING: THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION; HIGHER ONGOING FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND AN FDIC

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF $675 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009; HIGHER MORTGAGE

SERVICING AND DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE, WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSE OF

$1.2 BILLION; HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS; AND THE EFFECT OF THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE,

PARTICULARLY IN IB, TSS AND AM; A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS; LOWER MORTGAGE REINSURANCE LOSSES; AND A DECREASE IN CREDIT

CARD MARKETING EXPENSE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, REFER TO NOTE 17 ON PAGES

214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR INFORMATION ON MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 10 ON PAGE 186 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2008 WAS $43.5 BILLION, UP $1.8 BILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE ADDITIONAL OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION AND BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN

THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE

DECREASED DUE TO A NET REDUCTION IN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO LITIGATION; LOWER CREDIT CARD AND

CONSUMER LENDING MARKETING EXPENSE; AND A DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, AS CERTAIN

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS WERE FULLY AMORTIZED IN 2007, AND THE AMORTIZATION RATE FOR

CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES DECLINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE. THESE DECREASES

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY INCREASES IN PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES, DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN NEW

PRODUCT PLATFORMS IN TSS, AND BUSINESS AND VOLUME GROWTH IN CS CREDIT CARD PROCESSING AND IB

BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE TRANSACTION PROCESSING. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASES WERE

THE FOLLOWING: AN INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE DUE TO HIGHER MORTGAGE REINSURANCE LOSSES AND MORTGAGE

SERVICING EXPENSE DUE TO INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS IN RFS; AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY,

COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE, REFLECTING HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES

SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES IN RFS, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY-RELATED INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE BUSINESSES;

AND AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE, PARTLY RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF RFSS RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, REFER TO NOTE 17 ON PAGES

214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME AND CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL AND

STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. BENEFITS RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT INCOME, BUSINESS TAX CREDITS AND TAX AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS INCREASED IN 2009 RELATIVE TO 2008; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON THE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME IN 2009. IN ADDITION, 2008

REFLECTED THE REALIZATION OF BENEFITS OF $1.1 BILLION FROM THE RELEASE OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE

REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAXES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 127131 AND NOTE 27 ON PAGES

226228 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2008 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS THE RESULT OF

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME, COMBINED WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME

SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL TAXES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS

INCREASED BUSINESS TAX CREDITS AND THE REALIZATION OF A $1.1 BILLION BENEFIT FROM THE RELEASE OF

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. THESE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE

DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, AND EQUITY LOSSES REPRESENTING

THE FIRMS 49.4% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BEAR STEARNS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008, FOR WHICH

NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS RECORDED.

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL.

THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS. THE ADJUSTED NET ASSET VALUE OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS AFTER PURCHASE ACCOUNTING

ADJUSTMENTS WAS HIGHER THAN THE CONSIDERATION PAID BY JPMORGAN CHASE, RESULTING IN AN EXTRAORDINARY

GAIN. THE PRELIMINARY GAIN RECOGNIZED IN 2008 WAS $1.9 BILLION. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE

FIRM RECOGNIZED A $76 MILLION INCREASE IN THE EXTRAORDINARY GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINAL PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 143148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPALS

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR

ON PAGES 138141 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED

BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED

CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER

COMPANIES U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS

RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP

RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUME CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY CS

REMAIN ON THE BALANCE SHEETS, AND PRESENTS REVENUE ON A FTE BASIS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT HAVE

ANY IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS OR BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE.

THE PRESENTATION OF CS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS ASSUMES THAT CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

SECURITIZED AND SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP REMAIN ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND

THAT THE EARNINGS ON THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME

MANNER AS THE EARNINGS ON RETAINED LOANS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN

CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED BASIS TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED AND DECISIONS ARE

MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED ON MANAGED FINANCIAL

INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE SAME UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING RISK MONITORING ARE USED FOR

BOTH LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND SECURITIZED LOANS. ALTHOUGH SECURITIZATIONS

RESULT IN THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS THE ONGOING

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS THE CUSTOMERS MAY CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS; ACCORDINGLY, THE

CUSTOMERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE SECURITIZED LOANS AND THE LOANS RETAINED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES MANAGED BASIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO

INVESTORS, ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOANS REPORTED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS. FOR A

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS RESULTS FOR CS, SEE CS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 6466

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS, AND LOANS AND RESIDUAL

INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 198205 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED THE NEW CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR

VIES. AS THE FIRM WILL BE DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS AS A RESULT OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE FIRM WILL CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THESE

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AT THEIR CARRYING VALUES ON JANUARY 1, 2010, AND CREDIT

CARDRELATED INCOME AND CREDIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WILL BE

PROSPECTIVELY RECORDED ON THE 2010 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATIONS

THAT ARE CURRENTLY USED TO REPORT SUCH ITEMS ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, SEE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

DEVELOPMENTS ON PAGES 132134 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON A FTE BASIS.

ACCORDINGLY, INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE

PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES. THIS

THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES.

THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (TCE) REPRESENTS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (I.E., TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK) LESS IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN MSRS) AND GOODWILL,

NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ROTCE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RATIO, MEASURES THE FIRMS

EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TCE AND IS, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, ANOTHER MEANINGFUL MEASURE TO ASSESS

THE FIRMS USE OF EQUITY.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT

BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE

UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND THEREFORE

FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE-OF-BUSINESS BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL

BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF

CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED

BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS.

(A) BEAR

STEARNS PRIVATE CLIENT SERVICES WAS RENAMED TO JPMORGAN SECURITIES AT

THE BEGINNING OF 2010.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A

STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING

METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS,

METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS

MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS

REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND

TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO THE TREASURY GROUP WITHIN THE

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SEGMENTS STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN

BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REVIEWED BY THE FIRMS ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO). BUSINESS

SEGMENTS MAY RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, THAT WOULD BE

EXPECTED IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF A SIMILAR PEER BUSINESS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER

COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE CAPITAL

MANAGEMENTLINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGES 84-85 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE

SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THEIR

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ACTUAL COST OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR MARKET, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED.

IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY

AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED

EXPENSE INCLUDES: PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE

BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS

WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

ALSO INCLUDED LOSSES OF $536 MILLION FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN

STRUCTURED LIABILITIES, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $510 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CREDIT PORTFOLIO

REVENUE WAS A LOSS OF $1.0 BILLION VERSUS A GAIN OF $860 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON HEDGES OF RETAINED LOANS COMPARED WITH GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE NET IMPACT OF CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

ON $26.1 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET LOSS WAS $1.2 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $4.3 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER TOTAL

NET REVENUE, A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A REDUCTION IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ON OVERSEAS EARNINGS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $12.3 BILLION, DOWN $6.0 BILLION, OR 33%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES WERE $5.9 BILLION, DOWN 11% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEBT UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY FEES REFLECTING REDUCED MARKET ACTIVITY. DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $2.2 BILLION, DOWN

18% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER LOAN SYNDICATION AND BOND UNDERWRITING FEES. ADVISORY FEES

OF $2.0 BILLION DECLINED 12% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $1.7 BILLION, UP 2%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY IMPROVED MARKET SHARE. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE WAS $2.0 BILLION,

MARKDOWNS ON MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES AND $4.7 BILLION OF NET MARKDOWNS ON LEVERAGED LENDING

FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. REVENUE WAS ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL LOSSES AND COSTS

STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE WAS $860 MILLION, DOWN 40%, DRIVEN

BY LOSSES FROM WIDENING COUNTERPARTY CREDIT SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING A HIGHER ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DRIVEN BY A WEAKENING CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM HELD-FOR-SALE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. NET

CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR WERE $105 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $36 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR), SEE PAGES 118122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(E)

AVERAGE VARS WERE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF THEIR MARKET RISK COMPONENTS, DUE TO RISK

OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT REFLECTED THE

FACT THAT THE RISKS WERE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF VAR, SEE PAGES

118122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS IS USUALLY LESS THAN THE

SUM OF THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES.

THE DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

(DVA) TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM. SEE VAR DISCUSSION ON PAGES 118122 AND THE DVA

TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS. INCLUDING CDI AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE OVERHEAD RATIO CALCULATION

WOULD RESULT IN A HIGHER OVERHEAD RATIO IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND A LOWER OVERHEAD RATIO IN

LATER YEARS; THIS METHOD WOULD THEREFORE RESULT IN AN IMPROVING OVERHEAD RATIO OVER TIME, ALL

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

NET INCOME WAS $97 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $783 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS THE INCREASE IN

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES MORE THAN OFFSET THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION.

NET REVENUE WAS $32.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $9.2 BILLION, OR 39%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $20.5 BILLION, UP BY $6.3 BILLION, OR 45%, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, AND WIDER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $12.2

BILLION, UP BY $2.8 BILLION, OR 30%, DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

WIDER MARGINS ON MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND HIGHER NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$1.6 BILLION  IN ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $15.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $6.0 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND HOUSING PRICE DECLINES CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR

THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE PROVISION INCLUDED AN ADDITION OF $5.8 BILLION TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, COMPARED WITH AN ADDITION OF $5.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

INCLUDED IN THE 2009 ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS A $1.6 BILLION INCREASE RELATED

TO ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO. TO DATE,

NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS; SEE PAGE 62 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATES, AS REPORTED. HOME EQUITY NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $4.7 BILLION

(4.32% EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS), COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION (2.39% EXCLUDING

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $1.6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET INCOME WAS $880 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $2.0 BILLION, OR 70%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POSITIVE MSR RISK

MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $23.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $6.2 BILLION, OR 36%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $14.2 BILLION, UP $3.6 BILLION, OR 35%, BENEFITING FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WIDER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS, AND HIGHER LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $9.4 BILLION, UP $2.6 BILLION, OR 38%, AS POSITIVE MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS, THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER MORTGAGE ORIGINATION VOLUME AND HIGHER

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF

PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AND MARKDOWNS ON THE MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $9.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $7.3 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

DELINQUENCY RATES HAVE INCREASED DUE TO OVERALL WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHILE HOUSING PRICE

DECLINES HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE INCREASED LOSS SEVERITIES, PARTICULARLY FOR HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE

HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE LOANS. THE PROVISION INCLUDES $4.7 BILLION IN ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HERITAGE CHASE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. HOME EQUITY NET

CHARGE-OFFS WERE $2.4 BILLION (2.23% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE; 2.39% EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS), COMPARED WITH $564 MILLION (0.62% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS), COMPARED WITH $33 MILLION (0.13% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS ALSO

AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THE AUTO, STUDENT AND BUSINESS BANKING LOAN

PORTFOLIOS.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $12.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.2 BILLION, OR 22%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER MORTGAGE REINSURANCE

LOSSES, HIGHER MORTGAGE SERVICING EXPENSE AND INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

RETAIL BANKING USES THE OVERHEAD RATIO (EXCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF CDI), A NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING EXPENSE TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS. INCLUDING CDI

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE OVERHEAD RATIO CALCULATION WOULD RESULT IN A HIGHER OVERHEAD RATIO

IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND A LOWER OVERHEAD RATIO IN LATER YEARS; THIS METHOD WOULD THEREFORE

RESULT IN AN IMPROVING OVERHEAD RATIO OVER TIME, ALL THINGS REMAINING EQUAL. THE NON-GAAP

RATIO EXCLUDES RETAIL BANKINGS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND THE BANK ONE MERGER OF $328 MILLION, $394 MILLION AND $460

MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

YEAR. TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $18.0 BILLION, UP BY $5.3 BILLION, OR 42%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WIDER DEPOSIT SPREADS, HIGHER

AVERAGE DEPOSIT BALANCES AND HIGHER DEBIT CARD INCOME. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $1.1

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $449 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE

BUSINESS BANKING PORTFOLIO. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $10.4 BILLION, UP BY $3.1 BILLION, OR 43%. THE

INCREASE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS

AND HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

RETAIL BANKING NET INCOME WAS $3.0 BILLION, UP $737 MILLION, OR 33%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NET

REVENUE WAS $12.6 BILLION, UP $2.7 BILLION, OR 27%, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WIDER DEPOSIT SPREADS, HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $449 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $79 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR BUSINESS BANKING LOANS DUE TO HIGHER

ESTIMATED LOSSES ON

THE PORTFOLIO. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $7.2 BILLION, UP $1.1 BILLION, OR 17%, FROM

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CARD SERVICES

CARD SERVICES IS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST CREDIT

CARD ISSUERS, WITH MORE THAN 145 MILLION CREDIT CARDS IN CIRCULATION AND OVER

$163 BILLION IN MANAGED LOANS. CUSTOMERS USED CHASE CARDS TO MEET MORE THAN

$328 BILLION OF THEIR SPENDING NEEDS IN 2009.

CHASE CONTINUES TO INNOVATE, DESPITE A VERY DIFFICULT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT,

LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SUCH AS BLUEPRINT, ULTIMATE REWARDS, CHASE

SAPPHIRE AND INK FROM CHASE, AND EARNING A MARKET LEADERSHIP POSITION IN

BUILDING LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS. THROUGH ITS MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS,

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, CHASE IS ONE OF THE LEADING PROCESSORS OF

CREDIT-CARD PAYMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED BASIS TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF ITS CREDIT

CARD LOANS, BOTH LOANS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ON

PAGES 5052 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. MANAGED RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS ON TOTAL NET REVENUE, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND LOAN

RECEIVABLES. SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE REPORTED NET INCOME; HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE

CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF CSS FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTS THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS

CREDIT CARDS OPERATIONS, AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008,

AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2008. SEE NOTE 2

ON PAGES 143148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE TRANSACTIONS.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

CARD SERVICES REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $2.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $780 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER TOTAL NET REVENUE.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE $163.4 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $26.9 BILLION, OR 14%, FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER CHARGE VOLUME AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS. AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS

WERE $172.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $9.5 BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, END-OF-PERIOD AND AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS FOR 2009 WERE $143.8 BILLION AND $148.8

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $20.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $3.8 BILLION, OR 23%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $17.4 BILLION, UP BY $3.6 BILLION, OR 26%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

DRIVEN BY WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THESE BENEFITS

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS, A DECREASED

LEVEL OF FEES, LOWER AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $201 MILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER SECURITIZATION INCOME.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $18.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $8.4 BILLION FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND AN ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 9.33%, UP FROM 5.01% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS

6.28%, UP FROM 4.97% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 8.45%, AND THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 5.52%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $241 MILLION, OR 5%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE

TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET INCOME WAS $780 MILLION, A DECLINE OF $2.1 BILLION, OR 73%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE

WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TOTAL NET REVENUE.

AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS WERE $162.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $13.5 BILLION, OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE $190.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $33.3 BILLION, OR 21%, FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS WERE $155.9 BILLION AND

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE $162.1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BILLION. THE INCREASES IN BOTH AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS AND END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND ORGANIC PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $16.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.2 BILLION, OR 8%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.8 BILLION, UP $1.6 BILLION, OR 13%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN

BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, AND WIDER LOAN SPREADS.

THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $327 MILLION, OR 11%, FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE, LOWER SECURITIZATION INCOME DRIVEN BY HIGHER

CREDIT LOSSES, AND HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS; THESE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY

INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, BENEFITING FROM A 4% INCREASE IN CHARGE VOLUME, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT

OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $10.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $4.3 BILLION, OR 76%,

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $1.7 BILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE INCREASED TO 5.01%, UP FROM 3.68% IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 4.97%, UP FROM 3.48% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 4.92% AND THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY

RATE WAS 4.36%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $226 MILLION, OR 5%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND OTHER INCOME.

ON A CLIENT-SEGMENT BASIS, REVENUE FROM MIDDLE MARKET BANKING WAS $3.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $116

MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES, A SHIFT TO HIGHER-SPREAD

LIABILITY PRODUCTS, WIDER LOAN SPREADS, HIGHER LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AND HIGHER OTHER

INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NARROWING OF SPREADS ON LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND REDUCED LOAN BALANCES.

OF $632 MILLION. MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $1.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $181 MILLION, OR

12%, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

PREDOMINANTLY IN REAL ESTATE-RELATED SEGMENTS. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $1.1 BILLION (1.02% NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE), COMPARED WITH $288 MILLION (0.35% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

COMPRESSION IN THE LIABILITY AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.5 BILLION, UP $218

MILLION, OR 17%, DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT- AND LENDING-RELATED FEES.

ON A CLIENT-SEGMENT BASIS, MIDDLE MARKET BANKING REVENUE WAS

$2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $250 MILLION, OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE

PREDOMINANTLY TO HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND LOAN BALANCES. REVENUE

FROM COMMERCIAL TERM LENDING, A NEW CLIENT SEGMENT ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

WAS $243 MILLION. MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $921 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $106 MILLION, OR

13%, REFLECTING HIGHER LOAN BALANCES, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES. REAL

ESTATE BANKING REVENUE OF $413 MILLION DECREASED $8 MILLION, OR 2%.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $464 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $185 MILLION, OR 66%, COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND LOAN GROWTH. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE

$288 MILLION (0.35% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE), COMPARED WITH $44 MILLION (0.07% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN

THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN REAL ESTATE CHARGE-OFFS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES INCREASED BY $1.1 BILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMING ASSETS WERE $1.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION COMPARED

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER REAL

ESTATERELATED BALANCES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.9 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $12 MILLION, OR 1%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO

LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND VOLUME-BASED CHARGES FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS,

PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $85 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $18 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.3 BILLION, DOWN $217 MILLION, OR 4%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO

LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM INCREASED AVERAGE HEADCOUNT.

YEAR. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT WERE $1.2 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $116 BILLION, OR 10%, FROM THE

INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY OUTFLOWS IN CASH PRODUCTS. CUSTODY, BROKERAGE,

ADMINISTRATION AND DEPOSIT BALANCES WERE $452 BILLION, UP BY $89 BILLION, DUE TO THE EFFECT OF

HIGHER MARKET LEVELS ON CUSTODY AND BROKERAGE BALANCES, AND BROKERAGE INFLOWS IN THE PRIVATE BANK.

DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS AND NON-LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS, PREDOMINANTLY

OFFSET BY LIQUIDITY PRODUCT INFLOWS ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS AND THE ADDITION OF BEAR STEARNS ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT. CUSTODY, BROKERAGE, ADMINISTRATION AND DEPOSIT BALANCES WERE $363 BILLION, DOWN

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS

FROM THE FDIC FOR $1.9 BILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL NET ASSETS ACQUIRED

EXCEEDED THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP

FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE WERE WRITTEN DOWN

AGAINST THAT NEGATIVE GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER WRITING DOWN

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN IN 2008. AS A RESULT OF THE FINAL

REFINEMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM

RECOGNIZED A $76 MILLION INCREASE IN THE EXTRAORDINARY GAIN

(I)

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM

THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY WASHINGTON

MUTUAL (THE TRUST). AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT QUALITY CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK

RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE

OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION

EXPENSE WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.

THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS

RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON

MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE

AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $150 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $419

MILLION FDIC SPECIAL ASSESSMENT. TRADING GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICES (CIO)

SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS WERE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK

AND INVESTMENT OF CASH RESULTING FROM THE EXCESS FUNDING THE FIRM CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE DURING

2009. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF HIGHER-COUPON INSTRUMENTS (PART

OF REPOSITIONING THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO) AS WELL AS PREPAYMENTS AND MATURITIES.

ADDITION OF THE BEAR STEARNS PORTFOLIOS. THE PORTFOLIO REPRESENTED 5.8% OF THE FIRMS STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY LESS GOODWILL AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DOWN FROM 9.2% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS; FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; AND

SECURITIES BORROWED

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, TO MANAGE THE

FIRMS CASH POSITIONS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS TRADING AND

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM USES SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TO PROVIDE FUNDING OR LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS BY PURCHASING AND

BORROWING THEIR SECURITIES FOR THE SHORT-TERM. THE DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS PRIMARILY

REFLECTED LOWER DEMAND FOR INTERBANK LENDING AND LOWER DEPOSITS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK

RELATIVE TO THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT THE END OF 2008. THE DECREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS WAS LARGELY DUE TO A SHIFT BY THE FIRM OF ITS EXCESS CASH TO THE

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER SECURITIES PURCHASED

UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS IN IB DUE TO IMPROVED AND MORE LIQUID MARKET CONDITIONS.

FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES 8892 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS

DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE USED FOR BOTH MARKET-MAKING AND, TO A LIMITED EXTENT,

PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF FIXED-INCOME

SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE DEBT; EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE

SECURITIES; LOANS, INCLUDING PRIME MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOANS WAREHOUSED BY RFS AND IB FOR SALE OR

SECURITIZATION PURPOSES AND ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE; AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES

CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE IMPACT OF THE

CHALLENGING CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTED DURING THE LATTER PART OF 2008, WHICH

CONTINUED INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STABILIZATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2009. TRADING LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS INCREASED AS

MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED AND CAPITAL MARKETS STABILIZED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO TRANSFORM OR MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET

RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY OR COMMODITY

PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO USES

DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE RISKS OF MARKET EXPOSURES AND TO MAKE INVESTMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF

THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES. THE DECREASE IN DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TIGHTENING CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES AND RISING RATES ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON PAGES 102104, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 5 ON PAGES 148165 AND 167175,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS CLASSIFIED AS AFS AND IS USED PRIMARILY TO MANAGE

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND TO INVEST CASH RESULTING FROM EXCESS FUNDING

POSITIONS. THE INCREASE IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS DUE TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF EXCESS CASH,

WHICH WAS USED TO PURCHASE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF HIGHER-COUPON INSTRUMENTS,

AS PART OF POSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENTS AND MATURITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT ON PAGES 7475,

AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 11 ON PAGES 148165 AND 187191, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

76

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS

TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. LOANS DECREASED ACROSS MOST LINES OF BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH GROSS NEW LENDING

VOLUMES REMAINED AT LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH 2008, CONTINUED LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND, REPAYMENTS AND

CHARGE-OFFS IN THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES RESULTED IN LOWER BALANCES. LOWER CHARGE

VOLUME ON CREDIT CARDS AND THE EFFECT OF TIGHTER UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS,

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN LOANS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED IN BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, AS WEAK

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HOUSING PRICE DECLINES AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER

ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR MOST OF THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIOS. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 93117, AND NOTES

3, 4, 13 AND 14 ON PAGES 148165, 165167, 192196 AND 196198, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSIST OF ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLES FROM

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS; RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS (PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IBS

PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS); RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS; AND

RECEIVABLES FROM FAILED SECURITIES SALES. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH MATURITIES OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS SLIGHTLY HIGHER FAILED SECURITIES SALES.

OTHER ASSETS

OTHER ASSETS CONSIST OF PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, COLLATERAL RECEIVED, CORPORATE AND

BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE

OWNED) AND ALL OTHER ASSETS, INCLUDING RECEIVABLES FOR SECURITIES PROVIDED AS COLLATERAL. THE

DECREASE IN OTHER ASSETS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE TO ZERO IN THE BALANCE RELATED TO THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON AML FACILITY. THIS FACILITY WAS ENDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF

BOSTON ON FEBRUARY 1, 2010.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ARISES FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN

ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED.

THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL WAS LARGELY DUE TO FINAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE

BEAR STEARNS MERGER, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE FIRMS CANADIAN CREDIT

CARD OPERATIONS, AND IBS ACQUISITION OF A COMMODITIES BUSINESS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MSRS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SPECIFIED MORTGAGE SERVICING

ACTIVITIES (PREDOMINANTLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES) FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX

AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF

THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. MSRS INCREASED DUE TO INCREASES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET,

RELATED PRIMARILY TO MARKET INTEREST RATE AND OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

PREPAYMENTS, AS WELL AS SALES IN RFS OF ORIGINATED LOANS FOR WHICH SERVICING RIGHTS WERE RETAINED.

THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY SERVICING PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

MSRS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, OTHER CREDIT CARD-RELATED

INTANGIBLES, CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. THE DECREASE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS PRIMARILY REFLECTED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE FIRMS CANADIAN CREDIT CARD OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DEPOSITS

DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS, BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE, RELATED TO NON-BROKERAGE

FUNDS HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS ARE CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION (U.S. AND NON-U.S.), WHETHER THEY

ARE INTEREST- OR NONINTEREST-BEARING, AND BY TYPE (I.E., DEMAND, MONEY MARKET, SAVINGS, TIME OR

NEGOTIABLE ORDER OF WITHDRAWAL ACCOUNTS). DEPOSITS HELP PROVIDE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

FUNDING FOR THE FIRM. WHOLESALE DEPOSITS IN TSS DECLINED FROM THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED NORMALIZATION OF DEPOSIT LEVELS FOLLOWING THE STRONG INFLOWS

RESULTING FROM THE HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS AFFECTING THE MARKETS DURING THE

LATTER PART OF 2008. ORGANIC GROWTH IN DEPOSITS IN CB AND RFS WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE MATURITY

OF HIGH RATE INTEREST-BEARING CDS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE RFS AND AM SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 5863 AND

7173, RESPECTIVELY; THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON

PAGES 8892; AND NOTE 19 ON PAGE

218 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES, INCLUDING

DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 6768 AND 6970, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND TO SUPPORT THE

FIRMS TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM USES FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED

AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS SHORT-TERM FUNDING SOURCES AND TO MAKE

SECURITIES AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE PRICING AND THE FINANCING

OF THE INCREASE IN THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES 8892 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM USES COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, AND IN CONNECTION WITH A TSS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

PRODUCT, WHEREBY EXCESS CLIENT FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER OVERNIGHT SWEEP

ACCOUNTS. THE DECREASE IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL

HOME LOAN BANKS; THE ABSENCE OF BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE TERM

REPORT.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES CONSIST OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS (PRIMARILY FROM

ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS); PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING

ORGANIZATIONS; PAYABLES FROM FAILED SECURITIES PURCHASES; ACCRUED EXPENSE, INCLUDING

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES; AND ALL OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING OBLIGATIONS TO RETURN SECURITIES

RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED

LOWER CUSTOMER PAYABLES DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO LOWER BALANCES IN THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OF IBS PRIME

SERVICES CUSTOMERS.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

JPMORGAN CHASE USES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT

MANNER. A VIE IS CONSOLIDATED IF THE FIRM WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF A VIES EXPECTED LOSSES,

RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF A VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE INTEREST-BEARING BENEFICIAL-INTEREST

LIABILITIES ISSUED BY THE CONSOLIDATED VIES, WHICH INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 OF A MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT AND A CREDIT CARD LOAN SECURITIZATION

TRUST (WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FIRM-SPONSORED VIES AND LOAN

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS BELOW,

AND  NOTE 16 ON PAGES 206214 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

THE FIRM USES LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) TO PROVIDE

COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDS AND AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED SLIGHTLY, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET

REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES. THE FIRM ALSO ISSUED $11.0 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION OF NON-FDIC

GUARANTEED DEBT IN THE U.S. AND EUROPEAN MARKETS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $2.5 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE

THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 8892 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

THE DECREASE IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE REDEMPTION IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2009 OF THE $25.0 BILLION SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY PURSUANT TO TARP,

AND THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK. THE DECREASE WAS ALMOST

ENTIRELY OFFSET BY NET INCOME FOR 2009; THE ISSUANCE OF $5.8 BILLION OF COMMON EQUITY IN THE PUBLIC

MARKETS; A NET INCREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, DUE PRIMARILY TO NET UNREALIZED

GAINS FROM OVERALL MARKET SPREAD AND MARKET LIQUIDITY IMPROVEMENT, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE

COMPOSITION OF INVESTMENTS IN THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO; AND NET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

SECTION ON PAGES 8285, NOTE 23 ON PAGES

222223

AND NOTE 26 ON PAGE 225 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS

INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES

(SPES) AND LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF

THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, SHORT-TERM

ASSET-BACKED NOTES, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTEREST. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO

INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE

CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO

THE MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING

FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SPES

THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND AS A RESULT

OF ITS LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS, THROUGH QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES). THIS DISCUSSION FOCUSES

MOSTLY ON MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ALL SPES

WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, AND THE RELATED ACCOUNTING, SEE NOTE 1, NOTE 15 AND NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 142143, 198205 AND 206214, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2009, THE FIRM TOOK CERTAIN ACTIONS RELATED TO BOTH THE CHASE

ISSUANCE TRUST (THE TRUST) AND THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST (THE WMM TRUST). THESE

ACTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE

FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES 198205 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED

EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM MODIFIES LOANS THAT IT SERVICES, AND THAT WERE SOLD TO OFF-BALANCE SHEET SPES, PURSUANT TO

THE U.S. TREASURYS MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (MHA) PROGRAMS AND THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS MITIGATION

PROGRAMS. FOR BOTH THE FIRMS ON-BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND LOANS SERVICED FOR OTHERS, APPROXIMATELY

600,000 MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS HAD BEEN OFFERED TO BORROWERS IN 2009. OF THESE, 89,000 HAVE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LOANS CONTRACTUALLY MODIFIED TO DATE WERE

MODIFIED UNDER THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS MITIGATION PROGRAMS. SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

106115 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE DETAILS ON THESE LOAN MODIFICATIONS.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES

PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH

THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WAS DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS,

PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT

OF THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WAS $34.2 BILLION AND $61.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE

REPLACED BY ANOTHER LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF PROVIDING FUNDING UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT

OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN

THE SPE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES ARE INCLUDED IN

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AS SHOWN IN THE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES TABLE ON PAGE 81 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH THREE TYPES OF SPES: MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, INVESTOR

INTERMEDIATION, AND ITS OWN LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. A SUMMARY OF EACH TYPE OF SPE FOLLOWS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM HELPS CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE

BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF

RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE

CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF

HIGHLY-RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW

FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES FEES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURING OF MULTI-SELLER

CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND RECEIVES COMPENSATION FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES THE FIRM USES IN THESE STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE MUNICIPAL

BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES, ASSET SWAP VEHICLES AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION

VEHICLES.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT

CARDS, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE). JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES WERE

STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGES 142143 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES WERE NOT REFLECTED

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE VEHICLES IS TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS AND GENERATE

LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM THROUGH THE SALE OF LOANS TO THE QSPES. THESE QSPES ARE FINANCED THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF FIXED- OR FLOATING-RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE SOLD TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS

OR HELD BY THE FIRM. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING THE NEW CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR VIES INCLUDING

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, SEE ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES ON PAGE 133 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES REVENUE

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN REVENUE INFORMATION RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED AND

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES AND QSPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT. THE REVENUE

REPORTED IN THE TABLE BELOW PRIMARILY REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL SERVICING AND CREDIT FEE INCOME (I.E.,

FOR INCOME FROM ACTING AS ADMINISTRATOR, STRUCTURER, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER). IT DOES NOT INCLUDE

MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING POSITIONS (SUCH AS

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS) ENTERED INTO WITH VIES. THOSE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO

MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE

FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY

FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES OFTEN

EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN AND EVEN HIGHER PROPORTIONS EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT. AS A RESULT, THE

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS

ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE PAGE 105 AND NOTE 31 ON PAGES

230234 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE ON THE NEXT PAGE PRESENTS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITY

AMOUNTS OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES. THE AMOUNTS IN

THE TABLE FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL

AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WOULD BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRM CAN

REDUCE OR CANCEL THESE LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES,

WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE EXCLUDES CERTAIN COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES THAT DO NOT HAVE A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE (E.G., LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION-RELATED

INDEMNIFICATIONS). FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES 230234 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE AGREEMENTS WITH THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER, ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS, AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES. IN 2009, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED A

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF THE

EXPECTED LOSS NOTE. AS A RESULT, ASSET PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, EXCLUDE $7.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, RELATED TO THIS

CONSOLIDATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT. THE MATURITIES, IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE, ARE BASED ON THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN THE SPE, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE REMAINDER OF EACH

CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS COMMITTED LIQUIDITY FACILITY PLUS EITHER THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE

OF THE ASSETS SHOULD THE COMMITTED LIQUIDITY FACILITY EXPIRE WITHOUT RENEWAL, OR THE EXPECTED TIME

TO SELL THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN THE SECURITIZATION MARKET.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY

REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. COMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CONTRACTS

TO PURCHASE FUTURE SERVICES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO REAL ESTATE-RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND

EQUIPMENT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE ON THE NEXT PAGE SUMMARIZES, BY REMAINING MATURITY, JPMORGAN CHASES

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL CASH

OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE TABLE BELOW

REFLECT THE MINIMUM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION UNDER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE

BOTH FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE ARE A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS TO BE

SETTLED IN CASH, PRIMARILY IN UNDER ONE YEAR. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; COMMERCIAL PAPER; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; PURCHASES OF DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVE PAYABLES; AND CERTAIN PURCHASES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT

FAILURES. ALSO EXCLUDED ARE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD NOT

BE ESTIMATED. FOR DISCUSSION REGARDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES), SEE NOTE 22 ON PAGES 220221 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OPERATING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION. THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRATEGY FOCUSES ON LONG-TERM STABILITY, WHICH ENABLES IT TO BUILD AND

INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRENGTH PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISION ON FUTURE

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE FIRMS EARNINGS OUTLOOK, SENIOR MANAGEMENT

EVALUATES ALL SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL AND MAKES DECISIONS TO VARY ANY SOURCE OR USE TO PRESERVE

THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRENGTH.

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO HOLD CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO.



COVER ALL MATERIAL RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;



MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;



ACHIEVE DEBT RATING TARGETS;



REMAIN FLEXIBLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES; AND



BUILD AND INVEST IN BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED

ENVIRONMENT.

THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL ARE KEY FACTORS IN SENIOR MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION OF THE

FIRMS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE FIRM STRONGLY EMPHASIZES THE QUALITY OF ITS CAPITAL AND, ACCORDINGLY,

HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ITS CAPITAL IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY. THE FIRM USES THE FOLLOWING

THREE CAPITAL DISCIPLINES.



REGULATORY CAPITAL

 THE CAPITAL REQUIRED ACCORDING TO STANDARDS STIPULATED BY U.S. BANK

REGULATORY AGENCIES.



ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

 A BOTTOMS-UP ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES.



LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

 THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT WOULD REQUIRE

IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, WHICH INCORPORATES SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC

RISK MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)

ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009, U.S.

BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED A NEW MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL, WHICH IS DEFINED AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY  SUCH AS PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USED BY BANKING REGULATORS,

INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL WITH

THE CAPITAL OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL ALONG WITH

THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES PRESENTED BELOW TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE GRANTED THE FIRM, FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER,

RELIEF UP TO A CERTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNT AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVES RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO BEAR STEARNS RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS AND OTHER EXPOSURES ACQUIRED. THE OCC GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. SIMILAR RELIEF FROM

ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. THE RELIEF WOULD HAVE ENDED, BY ITS TERMS, ON SEPTEMBER 30,

2009. COMMENCING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM NO LONGER ADJUSTED ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIOS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RELIEF IN THE CALCULATION OF ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF

JUNE 30, 2009.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, IN EXCESS

OF THE WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS INDICATED IN THE TABLES

BELOW. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE 4% WELL-CAPITALIZED

STANDARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF THE SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. FOR MORE

TOTAL ADJUSTED CARRYING VALUE OF NONFINANCIAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

DEDUCTIONS FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL.

THE FIRMS TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL WAS $105.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $86.9

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN INCREASE OF $18.4 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO NET INCOME

(ADJUSTED FOR DVA) OF $13.2 BILLION, A $5.8 BILLION ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN JUNE 2009, AND NET

ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OF $2.7 BILLION.

THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2.1 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS ON PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK AND

THE $1.1 BILLION ONE-TIME NONCASH ADJUSTMENT TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY RELATED TO THE

REDEMPTION OF THE $25.0 BILLION SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JUNE 5, 2009, THE FIRM ISSUED $5.8 BILLION, OR 163 MILLION SHARES, OF

COMMON STOCK TO SATISFY A REGULATORY CONDITION REQUIRING THE FIRM TO DEMONSTRATE IT COULD ACCESS

THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO REDEEM THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO

THE U.S. TREASURY. THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS ISSUANCE WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL WAS $133.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $136.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, A DECREASE OF $3.1 BILLION. THE DECREASE IN TIER 1 CAPITAL REFLECTS THE

REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN TIER 1 COMMON

CAPITAL AND $2.3 BILLION NET ISSUANCES OF QUALIFYING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AND THE RELATED FEDERAL

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE CAPITAL RATIOS OF THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 29 ON PAGES 228229 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM

PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S.

TREASURY, FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION, (I) 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK,

AND (II) A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTIDILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. ON JUNE 17, 2009,

THE FIRM REDEEMED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK, AND REPAID THE FULL

$25.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED DIVIDENDS. THE U.S. TREASURY EXCHANGED THE

WARRANT FOR 88,401,697 WARRANTS, EACH OF WHICH IS A WARRANT TO PURCHASE A SHARE OF THE FIRMS

COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE AND, ON DECEMBER 11, 2009, SOLD THE WARRANTS

IN A SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING FOR $950 MILLION. THE FIRM DID NOT PURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS SOLD

BY THE U.S. TREASURY.

BASEL II

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE

PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). THE GOAL OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO

PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS

PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH WILL REQUIRE JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT

BASEL II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS KEY U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

COMPLETE A QUALIFICATION PERIOD OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS DURING WHICH IT WILL NEED TO

DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW RULE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS PRIMARY U.S.

BANKING REGULATORS. THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE CONSISTS OF THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD,

STARTING NO LATER THAN APRIL 1, 2010, FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM TRANSITION PERIOD OF THREE YEARS.

DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, BASEL II RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT FALL BELOW CERTAIN

FLOORS BASED ON CURRENT (BASEL L) REGULATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH

ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED,

AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT, BASED ON VARIOUS ESTABLISHED TIMELINES, BASEL II RULES IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES ARE

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMORGAN SECURITIES) AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. JPMORGAN

SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. ARE EACH SUBJECT TO RULE 15C3-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (NET CAPITAL RULE). JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. ARE

ALSO REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS AND SUBJECT TO RULE 1.17 UNDER THE COMMODITY

FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC). J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP., A SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN

SECURITIES, PROVIDES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES.

JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. HAVE ELECTED TO COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM NET

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE NET

CAPITAL RULE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, JPMORGAN SECURITIES NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY THE NET CAPITAL

RULE, OF

$7.4 BILLION EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT BY $6.9 BILLION. J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP.S NET

CAPITAL OF $5.2 BILLION EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT BY $3.6 BILLION.

IN ADDITION TO ITS MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT, JPMORGAN SECURITIES IS REQUIRED TO HOLD

TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION AND IS ALSO REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) IN THE EVENT THAT TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5.0 BILLION, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF THE NET CAPITAL RULE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, JPMORGAN SECURITIES HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM AND

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RELATIVE TO THE RISKS UNDERLYING ITS BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, USING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM MEASURES ECONOMIC CAPITAL

PRIMARILY BASED ON FOUR RISK FACTORS: CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK. THE

GROWTH IN ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL FROM 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER CREDIT RISK CAPITAL WITHIN

THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES, DUE TO THE FULL YEAR EFFECT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND

REVISED PERFORMANCE DATA IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

RATING OBJECTIVES.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) AND

CONSUMER BUSINESSES (RFS AND CS).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND

DECLINES IN THE PORTFOLIO VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION,

MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT RATING

STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THOSE FOR WHICH ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE

MAINTAINED. THE CAPITAL METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE

AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD, CREDIT SPREADS, LOSS SEVERITY AND

PORTFOLIO CORRELATION.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK

SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT RATING STANDARD.

RESULTS FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OR PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED FROM AVAILABLE BENCHMARKS AND ARE NOT

MODEL-DRIVEN.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE

RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN

MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, SECURITIES PRICES

AND COMMODITIES PRICES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. RESULTS

FROM DAILY VAR, BIWEEKLY STRESS-TEST, ISSUER CREDIT SPREAD AND DEFAULT RISK CALCULATIONS AS WELL AS

OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. MARKET RISK CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT BASED ON ITS RISK CONTRIBUTION. SEE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 118124

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL RISK ON A BOTTOMS-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED ON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

OR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL

II FRAMEWORK. SEE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGE 125 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE

INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATIONAL RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY- AND PUBLICLY- HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS, AND

COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE

IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS,

POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY LIQUIDITY RISK. THE

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS EXPERIENCE

SUFFERED BY THE FIRM AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET

CONDITIONS.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN

EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS

ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS. RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY IS MEASURED

AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS A KEY MEASURE OF A BUSINESS SEGMENTS

DIVIDENDS

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID ON APRIL 30, 2009, TO SHAREHOLDERS

OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009. THE ACTION ENABLED THE FIRM TO RETAIN APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION IN

COMMON EQUITY DURING 2009, AND WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE FIRM HAD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL STRENGTH IN THE

EVENT THE VERY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR FURTHER

DETERIORATED.

AT $40.50 PER SHARE. THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMMON STOCK, SEE NOTE 24 ON PAGES 223224 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

STOCK REPURCHASES

IN APRIL 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE

REPURCHASE OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON SHARES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S.

TREASURYS SALE OF THE WARRANTS IT RECEIVED AS PART OF  THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AMENDED THE FIRMS SECURITIES REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO AUTHORIZE THE REPURCHASE OF

WARRANTS FOR ITS STOCK. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM DID NOT

REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, $6.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED

REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH RESPECT TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK, AND ALL THE AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE WARRANTS.

THE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT MANAGEMENTS

DISCRETION, AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND THE EXACT NUMBER OF SHARES AND WARRANTS PURCHASED IS

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES, MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH

OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND

MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE ITS

EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE,

DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE

ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND THE FIRMS OVERALL

RISK TOLERANCE IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRMS EARNINGS POWER, CAPITAL, AND DIVERSIFIED

BUSINESS MODEL. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO

PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO CREATE A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS

CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION: THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS DEALINGS,

INCLUDING LENDING, TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, IS IDENTIFIED AND AGGREGATED

THROUGH THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK

POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESTIMATING

POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC OR UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT MAY NOT BE CAPTURED IN

OTHER MODELS, AND THOSE RISKS ARE COMMUNICATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.



RISK MEASUREMENT: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING

CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS TESTS

AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE

ROUTINELY REVIEWED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK

ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECT UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL: THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCORPORATE

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY

AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING: EXECUTED ON BOTH A LINE OF BUSINESS AND A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THIS

INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY

RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK,

LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, AND REPUTATION RISK.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STARTS WITH EACH LINE OF BUSINESS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR

MANAGING ITS OWN RISKS. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS WORKS CLOSELY WITH RISK MANAGEMENT THROUGH ITS OWN

RISK COMMITTEE AND ITS OWN CHIEF RISK OFFICER TO MANAGE ITS RISK. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING THE BUSINESS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND

CONTROLS. THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS A MEMBER OF THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES.

OVERLAYING THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT ARE FOUR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK

MANAGEMENTRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE, CORPORATE TREASURY,

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING

COMMITTEE AND WHO REPORTS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY COMMITTEE. RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING AN

INDEPENDENT FIRMWIDE FUNCTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS. WITHIN THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK, AS WELL AS RISK REPORTING, RISK POLICY AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS. RISK TECHNOLOGY

AND OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO

MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AND CORPORATE TREASURY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING,

REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE HAS OVERSIGHT FOR LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, AN ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND

THREE OTHER RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES  THE RISK WORKING GROUP, THE GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY COMMITTEE AND

THE MARKETS COMMITTEE. ALL OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE OPERATING COMMITTEE WHICH IS INVOLVED IN

SETTING THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK APPETITE. THE MEMBERSHIP OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE COMPOSED OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF LINES OF BUSINESS, RISK MANAGEMENT, FINANCE

AND OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE COMMITTEES MEET FREQUENTLY TO DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS

INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS, RISK EXPOSURES, AND

RISK CONCENTRATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPACT OF RISK FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED BROADLY ACROSS THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES.

RISK. ALCO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY

FUNDING PLAN. ALCO ALSO REVIEWS THE FIRMS FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF

BUSINESS TRANSFER INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK TO CORPORATE TREASURY IN THE

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT), EARNINGS AT RISK, OVERALL INTEREST RATE POSITION, FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS AND STRATEGY, AND THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS (AND ANY REQUIRED LIQUIDITY

SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF SUCH PROGRAMS).

THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OVERSEES GLOBAL MERGER

AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE

SCOPE OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

THE RISK WORKING GROUP IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW

ISSUES THAT CROSS LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS RISK POLICY, RISK METHODOLOGY, BASEL II AND OTHER

REGULATORY ISSUES, AND SUCH OTHER TOPICS REFERRED TO IT BY LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES OR THE

FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

THE MARKETS COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, MEETS WEEKLY TO REVIEW, MONITOR AND

DISCUSS SIGNIFICANT RISK MATTERS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK ISSUES;

MARKET MOVING EVENTS; LARGE TRANSACTIONS; HEDGING STRATEGIES; REPUTATION RISK; CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST; AND OTHER ISSUES.

THE GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY COMMITTEE DESIGNATES TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER OF THE FIRM CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM MAY TRADE AT EXPOSURE LEVELS ABOVE PORTFOLIO-ESTABLISHED

THRESHOLDS WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS TRADING ACTIVITIES. THE COMMITTEE MEETS

QUARTERLY TO REVIEW TOTAL EXPOSURES WITH THESE COUNTERPARTIES, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

COUNTERPARTY TRADING EXPOSURES, AND TO DIRECT CHANGES IN EXPOSURE LEVELS AS NEEDED.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARDS

RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT

RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST

THESE POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF

GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS

UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IS CRUCIAL TO FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY DURING PERIODS OF

ADVERSE CONDITIONS. JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE A DIVERSIFIED DEPOSIT

BASE AND ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) AND

EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS. THE FIRMS FUNDING STRATEGY IS INTENDED TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND DIVERSITY

OF FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET ACTUAL AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES DURING BOTH NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS STRATEGY, JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS LARGE POOLS OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED

ASSETS AND SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF SECURED FUNDING, AND MONITORS ITS CAPACITY IN THE WHOLESALE

FUNDING MARKETS ACROSS VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES. THE FIRM ALSO

MAINTAINS ACCESS TO SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY THROUGH OVERNIGHT BORROWINGS FROM VARIOUS CENTRAL

BANKS. THROUGHOUT THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FIRM SUCCESSFULLY RAISED BOTH SECURED AND

UNSECURED FUNDING.

GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS GOVERNANCE PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINS STRONG. THE

ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING

PLAN. CORPORATE TREASURY FORMULATES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY

AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN AS WELL AS MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE. JPMORGAN CHASE USES A CENTRALIZED APPROACH FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT TO

MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS, MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS AND PERMIT IDENTIFICATION AND COORDINATION OF

GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RISK. THIS APPROACH INVOLVES FREQUENT COMMUNICATION WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS,

DISCIPLINED MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, COMPREHENSIVE MARKET-BASED

PRICING OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CONTINUOUS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT, FREQUENT STRESS TESTING

OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES, AND FREQUENT REPORTING TO AND COMMUNICATION WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

LIQUIDITY MONITORING

THE FIRM MONITORS LIQUIDITY TRENDS, TRACKS HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS, IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY WARNING SIGNALS TO

PERMIT EARLY DETECTION OF LIQUIDITY ISSUES, AND MANAGES CONTINGENCY PLANNING (INCLUDING

IDENTIFICATION AND TESTING OF VARIOUS COMPANY-SPECIFIC AND MARKET-DRIVEN STRESS SCENARIOS). VARIOUS

TOOLS, WHICH TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERALL FIRMWIDE LIQUIDITY PERSPECTIVE, ARE USED TO MONITOR

AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY. AMONG OTHERS, THESE INCLUDE: (I) ANALYSIS OF THE TIMING OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES

VERSUS LIQUIDITY USES (I.E., FUNDING GAPS) OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM OVERNIGHT TO ONE YEAR; (II)

MANAGEMENT OF DEBT AND CAPITAL ISSUANCES TO ENSURE THAT THE ILLIQUID PORTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET

CAN BE FUNDED BY EQUITY, LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) AND

DEPOSITS THE FIRM BELIEVES TO BE STABLE; AND (III) ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS CAPACITY TO RAISE

INCREMENTAL UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING.

LIQUIDITY OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES IS MONITORED INDEPENDENTLY AS

WELL AS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES. AT THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANY LEVEL, LONG-TERM FUNDING IS MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY HAS, AT A

MINIMUM, SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES WITHIN

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, THE FOCUS OF LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS ON MAINTENANCE

OF UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY SUFFICIENT TO MEET ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

A COMPONENT OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THE FIRMS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE GOAL OF THE PLAN IS

TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY DURING NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. THE PLAN CONSIDERS VARIOUS

TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS WHERE ACCESS TO WHOLESALE UNSECURED FUNDING IS SEVERELY

LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, AND

SEPARATELY EVALUATES ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

RECENT EVENTS

THE EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF VOLATILITY EXHIBITED IN GLOBAL MARKETS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008

BEGAN TO SUBSIDE IN 2009. MARKET PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE DEBT, EQUITY AND

CONSUMER LOAN SECURITIZATION MARKETS AS SPREADS TIGHTENED AND LIQUIDITY RETURNED TO THE MARKETS.

THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION IS STRONG, BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY METRICS AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2009. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET

ITS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED FUNDING, INCLUDING CORE

LIABILITIES, EXCEEDED ILLIQUID ASSETS.

ON MARCH 30, 2009, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THAT, EFFECTIVE APRIL 27, 2009, IT WOULD REDUCE

THE AMOUNT IT LENT AGAINST CERTAIN LOANS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS FOR

DISCOUNT WINDOW OR PAYMENT-SYSTEM RISK PURPOSES, IN ORDER TO REFLECT RECENT TRENDS IN THE VALUES OF

THOSE TYPES OF COLLATERAL. ON OCTOBER 19, 2009, THE FEDERAL RESERVE FURTHER REDUCED THE AMOUNT IT

LENT AGAINST SUCH COLLATERAL. THESE CHANGES BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE FIRMS AGGREGATE FUNDING CAPACITY.

THE FIRM PARTICIPATED IN THE FDICS TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (THE TLG PROGRAM),

WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN LATE 2008 AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE TO HELP RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THIS PROGRAM IS COMPRISED OF TWO COMPONENTS: THE DEBT GUARANTEE PROGRAM THAT

PROVIDED AN FDIC GUARANTEE FOR CERTAIN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED THROUGH OCTOBER 31, 2009, AND

THE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE PROGRAM (THE TAG PROGRAM) THAT PROVIDES UNLIMITED INSURANCE ON

CERTAIN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS. THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE TAG PROGRAM WAS

EXTENDED BY SIX MONTHS, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, TO JUNE 30, 2010, TO PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO

THOSE INSTITUTIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND TO PHASE OUT

88

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROGRAM IN AN

ORDERLY MANNER. ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE FIRM NOTIFIED THE FDIC THAT, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2010, IT

WOULD NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE TAG PROGRAM. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS DECISION TO OPT OUT OF

THE PROGRAM, AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2009, FUNDS HELD IN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS WILL

NO LONGER BE GUARANTEED IN FULL, BUT WILL BE INSURED UP TO $250,000 UNDER THE FDICS GENERAL

DEPOSIT RULES. THE INSURANCE AMOUNT OF $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR IS IN EFFECT THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2013. ON JANUARY 1, 2014, THE INSURANCE AMOUNT WILL RETURN TO $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR FOR ALL

ACCOUNT CATEGORIES EXCEPT INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (IRAS) AND CERTAIN OTHER RETIREMENT

ACCOUNTS, WHICH WILL REMAIN AT $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

THE DEPOSITS HELD BY THE RFS, CB, TSS AND AM LINES OF BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY STABLE SOURCES OF

FUNDING FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE

$938.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.0 TRILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

FIRMS DEPOSITS ARE RETAIL DEPOSITS (38% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009), WHICH ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES OR MARKET VOLATILITY AND THEREFORE ARE CONSIDERED MORE STABLE THAN

MARKET-BASED (I.E., WHOLESALE) LIABILITY BALANCES. IN ADDITION, THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY BALANCES ORIGINATED BY RFS, CB, TSS AND AM.

THESE FRANCHISE-GENERATED LIABILITY BALANCES INCLUDE DEPOSITS, AS WELL AS DEPOSITS THAT ARE SWEPT

TO ONBALANCE SHEET LIABILITIES (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, AND SECURITIES

LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCES OF FUNDING DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FROM WHICH THEY ARE

GENERATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF DEPOSIT AND

LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

THE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES 5573 AND 7678, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDE A VARIETY OF UNSECURED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, BANK NOTES, COMMERCIAL

PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK AND COMMON STOCK.

SECURED SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDE SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS,

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS, AND BORROWINGS FROM THE CHICAGO, PITTSBURGH AND SAN FRANCISCO FEDERAL

HOME LOAN BANKS. THE FIRM ALSO BORROWS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE (INCLUDING DISCOUNT-WINDOW

BORROWINGS, THE PRIMARY DEALER CREDIT FACILITY AND THE TERM AUCTION FACILITY); HOWEVER, THE FIRM

DOES NOT VIEW SUCH BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS A PRIMARY MEANS OF FUNDING.

ISSUANCE

FUNDING MARKETS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE GLOBAL BALANCE OF

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING AT FAVORABLE RATES. GENERATING FUNDING FROM A BROAD RANGE OF SOURCES

IN A VARIETY OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ENHANCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON ANY

ONE SOURCE.

DURING 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED $19.7 BILLION AND $20.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

FDIC-GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT UNDER THE TLG PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2008. IN

2009 THE FIRM ALSO ISSUED NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT OF $16.1 BILLION, INCLUDING $11.0 BILLION OF

SENIOR NOTES AND $2.5 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, IN THE U.S. MARKET, AND

$2.6 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN THE EUROPEAN MARKETS. IN 2008 THE FIRM ISSUED NON-FDIC GUARANTEED

DEBT OF $23.6 BILLION, INCLUDING $12.2 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES AND $1.8 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES IN THE U.S. MARKET AND $9.6 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN NON-U.S. MARKETS.

ISSUING NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN 2009 WAS A PREREQUISITE TO REDEEMING THE

$25.0 BILLION OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, DURING 2009 AND 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED

$15.5 BILLION AND $28.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES THAT ARE INCLUDED WITHIN

LONG-TERM DEBT. DURING 2009 AND 2008, $55.7 BILLION AND $62.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF LONG-TERM

DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) MATURED OR WAS REDEEMED, INCLUDING $27.2

BILLION AND $35.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES; THE MATURITIES OR REDEMPTIONS IN

2009 OFFSET THE ISSUANCES DURING THE PERIOD. DURING 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM ALSO SECURITIZED $26.5

BILLION AND $21.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CREDIT CARD LOANS.

REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN OF ITS TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND ITS

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS

(RCCS). THESE RCCS GRANT CERTAIN RIGHTS TO THE HOLDERS OF COVERED DEBT, AS DEFINED IN THE RCCS,

THAT PROHIBIT THE REPAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR PURCHASE OF SUCH TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

AND NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK EXCEPT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO THE EXTENT THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECEIVED, IN EACH SUCH CASE, SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

CERTAIN QUALIFYING SECURITIES. CURRENTLY, THE FIRMS COVERED DEBT IS ITS 5.875% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES, SERIES O, DUE IN 2035. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THESE

COVENANTS, REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE RESPECTIVE RCCS (INCLUDING ANY SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) ENTERED

INTO BY THE FIRM IN RELATION TO SUCH TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND NONCUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN FILINGS MADE BY THE FIRM WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

CASH FLOWS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS DECREASED $689

MILLION, $13.2 BILLION AND $268 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE

MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASES CASH FLOWS DURING 2009, 2008 AND

2007.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE.

OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, MARKET CONDITIONS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

AND TRADING STRATEGIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND

THE FIRMS OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$121.9 BILLION AND $23.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, NET

CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $110.6 BILLION. IN 2009, THE NET DECLINE IN TRADING ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES WAS AFFECTED BY BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE IMPACT OF THE

CHALLENGING CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND CONTINUED INTO THE

FIRST HALF OF 2009. IN 2009 AND 2008, NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN

NET INCOME, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. IN ADDITION, FOR 2009 AND 2008 PROCEEDS FROM SALES, SECURITIZATIONS AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WERE HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH

LOANS, BUT THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE LOAN ACTIVITIES REMAINED AT REDUCED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF THE

LOWER ACTIVITY IN THESE MARKETS SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2007.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE NET CASH USED IN TRADING ACTIVITIES REFLECTED A MORE

ACTIVE CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, LARGELY FROM CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. ALSO

DURING 2007, CASH USED TO ORIGINATE OR PURCHASE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE WAS HIGHER THAN PROCEEDS FROM

SALES, SECURITIZATIONS AND PAYDOWNS OF SUCH LOANS, ALTHOUGH THESE ACTIVITIES WERE AFFECTED BY A

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN LIQUIDITY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE ORIGINATING LOANS TO BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT,

THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, NET CASH OF $29.4 BILLION WAS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM.

A DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING LOWER DEMAND FOR INTER-BANK LENDING AND LOWER DEPOSITS

WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RELATIVE TO THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT THE END OF 2008; A NET DECREASE IN

THE LOAN PORTFOLIO ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND AND LOAN SALES

IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, LOWER CHARGE VOLUME ON CREDIT CARDS, SLIGHTLY HIGHER CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, AND PAYDOWNS; AND THE MATURITY OF ALL ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY

MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AML FACILITY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF

BOSTON. LARGELY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WERE NET PURCHASES OF AFS SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND INVESTMENT OF CASH RESULTING FROM AN EXCESS FUNDING

POSITION.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, NET CASH OF $283.7 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY FOR: INCREASED DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AS THE RESULT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF EXCESS CASH FOR

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH INTERBANK LENDING, AND RESERVE BALANCES HELD BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE (WHICH BECAME AN INVESTING ACTIVITY IN 2008, REFLECTING A POLICY CHANGE OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE TO PAY INTEREST TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ON RESERVE BALANCES);

NET PURCHASES OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN THE AFS PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

MOVEMENTS; NET ADDITIONS

TO THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO FROM ORGANIC GROWTH IN CB; ADDITIONS TO THE CONSUMER PRIME MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO RETAIN, RATHER THAN SELL, NEW ORIGINATIONS OF

NONCONFORMING PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS; AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

REFLECTING GROWTH IN DEMAND FROM CLIENTS FOR LIQUIDITY; AND NET PURCHASES OF ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AML FACILITY OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE USES OF CASH WERE PROCEEDS FROM LOAN SALES AND

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS NET CASH RECEIVED FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE SALE OF AN

INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY, IN JUNE 2008, IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE FIRM SOLD

ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM BEAR STEARNS TO THE FRBNY AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $28.85 BILLION.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,2007, NET CASH OF $74.2 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY FOR: FUNDING PURCHASES IN THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS; NET ADDITIONS TO THE WHOLESALE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIOS IN IB, CB AND AM,

MAINLY AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS GROWTH; A NET INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN RFS IN HOME EQUITY LOANS AND NET ADDITIONS TO THE RFSS SUBPRIME

MORTGAGE LOANS PORTFOLIO (WHICH WAS AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS DECISION IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO

RETAIN (RATHER THAN SELL) NEW SUBPRIME MORTGAGES); GROWTH IN PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS

AND AM THAT WERE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED

ENTERPRISES; AND INCREASES IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER

LEVEL OF CASH THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE

FIRMS EFFORTS TO BUILD LIQUIDITY. THESE NET USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS

RECEIVED FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES AND FROM CREDIT CARD, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE,

STUDENT AND WHOLESALE LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECT CASH FLOWS RELATED TO RAISING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS,

AND ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) AS WELL AS PREFERRED

AND COMMON STOCK. IN 2009, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $152.2 BILLION; THIS REFLECTED

A DECLINE IN WHOLESALE DEPOSITS, PREDOMINANTLY IN TSS, DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED NORMALIZATION OF

WHOLESALE DEPOSIT LEVELS RESULTING FROM THE MITIGATION OF CREDIT CONCERNS, COMPARED WITH THE

HEIGHTENED MARKET VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS IN THE LATTER PART OF 2008; A DECLINE IN OTHER

BORROWINGS, DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE TERM AUCTION

FACILITY PROGRAM; NET REPAYMENTS OF ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS AND THE MATURITY OF THE

NONRECOURSE ADVANCES UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON AML FACILITY; THE JUNE 17, 2009,

REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE $25.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO THE

U.S. TREASURY; AND THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. CASH WAS ALSO USED

FOR THE NET

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, AS ISSUANCES

OF FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT AND NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT IN BOTH THE U.S. AND EUROPEAN MARKETS WERE

MORE THAN OFFSET BY REDEMPTIONS. CASH PROCEEDS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES LOANED OR

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE PRICING AND TO FINANCING THE

INCREASED SIZE OF THE FIRMS AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO; AND THE ISSUANCE OF $5.8 BILLION OF COMMON

STOCK. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES IN THE OPEN MARKET OF COMMON STOCK OR THE WARRANTS DURING 2009.

IN 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $247.8 BILLION DUE TO: GROWTH IN WHOLESALE

DEPOSITS, IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST- AND NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS IN TSS (DRIVEN BY BOTH NEW AND

EXISTING CLIENTS, AND DUE TO

THE DEPOSIT INFLOWS RELATED TO THE HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS AFFECTING THE GLOBAL

MARKETS THAT BEGAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008), AS WELL AS INCREASES IN AM AND CB (DUE TO ORGANIC

GROWTH); PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK AND THE WARRANT TO THE U.S.

TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM; ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED

STOCK USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES; AN INCREASE IN OTHER BORROWINGS DUE TO NONRECOURSE

SECURED ADVANCES UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON AML FACILITY TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS; INCREASES IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED

AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH HIGHER CLIENT DEMAND

FOR LIQUIDITY AND TO FINANCE GROWTH IN THE FIRMS AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO; AND A NET INCREASE IN

LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO A COMBINATION OF NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES ISSUED PRIOR TO DECEMBER 4, 2008, AND THE ISSUANCE OF $20.8 BILLION OF FDIC-GUARANTEED

LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE FOURTH-QUARTER FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT

ISSUANCE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MATURITIES OF NON-FDIC GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE SAME

PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES)

WAS USED

PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND TO BUILD

LIQUIDITY. CASH WAS ALSO USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. THE FIRM DID NOT

REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING 2008.

IN 2007, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $184.1 BILLION DUE TO A NET INCREASE IN

WHOLESALE DEPOSITS FROM GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES, IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AT

TSS, AM AND CB; NET ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES)

PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND BUILD LIQUIDITY,

AND BY IB FROM CLIENT-DRIVEN STRUCTURED NOTES TRANSACTIONS; AND GROWTH IN COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUANCES AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS DUE TO GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES IN SWEEP

ACCOUNTS IN TSS AND CB, AND TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS AND TO FURTHER BUILD LIQUIDITY. CASH WAS USED

TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE

RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST

OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND

ON DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES ON PAGES 7879 AND RATINGS

PROFILE OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MARKED TO MARKET (MTM),

AND NOTE 5 ON PAGE 103 AND PAGES 167175, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM,

STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES,

AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT BANKING

RATINGS ACTIONS AFFECTING THE FIRM

ON MARCH 4, 2009, MOODYS REVISED THE OUTLOOK ON THE FIRM TO NEGATIVE FROM STABLE. THIS ACTION WAS

THE RESULT OF MOODYS VIEW THAT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE CAPITAL WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY HIGHER CREDIT COSTS DUE TO THE GLOBAL RECESSION. THE RATING ACTION BY MOODYS IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, MOODYS OUTLOOK REMAINED NEGATIVE.

RATINGS FROM S&P AND FITCH ON JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES REMAINED UNCHANGED

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, S&PS OUTLOOK REMAINED

NEGATIVE, WHILE FITCHS OUTLOOK REMAINED STABLE.

FOLLOWING THE FIRMS EARNINGS RELEASE ON JANUARY 15, 2010, S&P AND MOODYS ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR

RATINGS ON THE FIRM REMAINED UNCHANGED.

IF THE FIRMS SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE ADDITIONAL NOTCH, THE FIRM

BELIEVES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF FUNDS OR LOSS OF FUNDING WOULD BE MANAGEABLE, WITHIN THE CONTEXT

OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RESOURCES. JPMORGAN CHASES UNSECURED DEBT

DOES NOT CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR

CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, PROVIDE ANY LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE BORROWINGS OR

REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, BASED ON UNFAVORABLE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL

RATIOS, EARNINGS, OR STOCK PRICE.

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2009, S&P LOWERED THE RATINGS ON THE TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND

OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES OF 45 U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRMS RATINGS ON TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT AND NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED SECURITIES

WERE LOWERED FROM A- TO BBB+. THIS ACTION WAS THE RESULT OF S&PS GENERAL VIEW THAT THERE IS AN

INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF ISSUERS SUSPENDING INTEREST AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT

ENVIRONMENT. THIS ACTION BY S&P DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF THE

FIRMS FUNDING.

ON DECEMBER 22, 2009, MOODYS LOWERED THE RATINGS ON CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS HYBRID SECURITIES. THE

DOWNGRADES WERE CONSISTENT WITH MOODYS REVISED GUIDELINES FOR RATING HYBRID SECURITIES AND

SUBORDINATED DEBT. THE RATINGS OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES WITH CUMULATIVE DEFERRAL

FEATURES WERE LOWERED TO A2 FROM A1, WHILE THOSE OF CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE DOWNGRADED

TO A3 FROM A2, AND RATINGS FOR NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE LOWERED TO BAA1 FROM A2.

ON JANUARY 29, 2010, FITCH DOWNGRADED 592 HYBRID CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY BANKS AND OTHER

NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE ISSUED BY THE FIRM. THIS ACTION WAS IN LINE WITH

FITCHS REVISED HYBRID RATINGS METHODOLOGY. THE FIRMS TRUST PREFERRED DEBT AND HYBRID PREFERRED

SECURITIES WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH TO A.

RATINGS ACTIONS AFFECTING FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

IN 2009, IN LIGHT OF INCREASING LEVELS OF LOSSES IN THE FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS DUE TO

THE THEN WORSENING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, S&P, MOODYS AND FITCH TOOK VARIOUS RATINGS ACTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, INCLUDING THE

CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST, CHASE CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUST, WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST AND SCORE

CREDIT CARD TRUST, INCLUDING PLACING THE RATINGS OF CERTAIN SECURITIES OF SUCH TRUSTS ON NEGATIVE

CREDIT WATCH OR REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE, AND, IN A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES, DOWNGRADING THE RATINGS

OF SOME OF THE SECURITIES.

ON MAY 12, 2009, THE FIRM TOOK CERTAIN ACTIONS TO INCREASE THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT UNDERLYING THE

CREDIT CARD ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES OF THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, THE

RATINGS OF ALL ASSET-BACKED CREDIT CARD SECURITIES OF THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST WERE AFFIRMED BY THE

CREDIT RATING AGENCIES, EXCEPT FOR A NEGATIVE RATING OUTLOOK BY FITCH WHICH REMAINS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, ON THE SUBORDINATED SECURITIES OF THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST.

ON MAY 19, 2009, THE FIRM REMOVED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST ALL REMAINING CREDIT

CARD RECEIVABLES THAT HAD BEEN ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL. AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION, THE

RATINGS OF ALL ASSET-BACKED CREDIT CARD SECURITIES OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST WERE

RAISED OR AFFIRMED BY THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE SENIOR SECURITIES OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST WERE DOWNGRADED BY S&P ON DECEMBER 23, 2009. S&PS ACTION

WAS THE RESULT OF THEIR CONSIDERATION OF A LINKAGE BETWEEN THE RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST AND THE FIRMS OWN RATINGS AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION

ONTO THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

MASTER NOTE TRUST FOLLOWING THE FIRMS ACTIONS ON MAY 19, 2009 (PLEASE REFER TO PAGE 200 UNDER NOTE

15 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT).

THE FIRM DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTIONS TO INCREASE THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT UNDERLYING SECURITIZATIONS

ISSUED BY THE CHASE CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUST AND THE SCORE CREDIT CARD TRUST DURING 2009. CERTAIN

MEZZANINE SECURITIES AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES OF THE CHASE CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUST WERE

DOWNGRADED BY S&P AND MOODYS ON AUGUST 6, 2009, AND JULY 10, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED SECURITIES OF THE SCORE CREDIT CARD TRUST WERE PLACED ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE

BY MOODYS ON JANUARY 20, 2010.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RATINGS ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO ACCESS THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION MARKET.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER NOTE TRUST AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE RATINGS ON

THE FIRMS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY INDEPENDENT OF THE FIRMS OWN RATINGS.

HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES WILL NOT IN THE FUTURE CONSIDER

THERE BEING A LINKAGE BETWEEN THE RATINGS OF THE FIRMS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES PROGRAMS AND THE

FIRMS OWN RATINGS AS A RESULT OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR QSPES AND VIES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2010. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE NEW FASB GUIDANCE, SEE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

DEVELOPMENTS AND NOTE 16 ON PAGES 132134 AND

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES

CREDIT (FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND DERIVATIVES) TO A

VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER.

FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIRMS

SYNDICATED LOAN ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKETPLACE WITH EXPOSURE HELD IN THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO

AVERAGING LESS THAN 10%. WHOLESALE LOANS GENERATED BY CB AND AM ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET. WITH REGARD TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO

THAT IS DIVERSIFIED FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES

ARE BEING EMPLOYED FOR ALL HOME LENDING PORTFOLIOS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE RATE REDUCTIONS,

FORBEARANCE AND OTHER ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND AVOID FORECLOSURE. IN THE

MORTGAGE BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE EITHER RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO OR SECURITIZED

AND SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF

BUSINESS. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO

SEGMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LINE APPROVAL



ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE



MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES AND DELINQUENT LOANS



CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURES

ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK

MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND CREDIT BUREAU

SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK-RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS

CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY

GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES

BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE LOSSES,

REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON

STATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF

CREDIT LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE

SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD BE

FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED

LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF

ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF LOSSES. RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A RISK-RATED BASIS; FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS ASSESSED

PRIMARILY ON A CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED (GENERALLY HELD IN IB, CB, TSS AND AM), PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS

GIVEN DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE EXPECTED DEFAULT CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS

GIVEN DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW. RISK RATINGS

ARE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO REFLECT THE BORROWERS CURRENT FINANCIAL

POSITION, RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL POSITIONS.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED ON A

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. PROBABLE LOSSES ARE

ESTIMATED USING SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO

PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, COMMON MEASURES OF CREDIT

QUALITY DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO PREDICT CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER RISK

CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION

SOURCES, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHARGE-OFF

POLICIES. THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE

DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE LOSSES. THESE FACTORS

AND ANALYSES ARE UPDATED AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS MARKET CONDITIONS

DICTATE.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT, AND TO ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE

ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH THE

TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES,

CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR

MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURE. WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN

AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF

MEANS INCLUDING LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS,

LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL

AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING RISK SECTIONS.

FOR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS ITEMS ARE TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL,

WHERE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO

GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND

INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT QUALITY

FORECASTS, CONCENTRATIONS LEVELS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND

DISCUSSED WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS MENTIONED ON PAGE 86 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2009 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

DURING 2009, THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCED FURTHER DETERIORATION COMPARED WITH 2008, RESULTING

IN INCREASED DEFAULTS, DOWNGRADES AND REDUCED LIQUIDITY. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR, THE PACE

OF DETERIORATION INCREASED, ADVERSELY AFFECTING MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND IMPACTING THE FUNCTIONING OF CREDIT MARKETS, WHICH REMAINED WEAK. THE PACE OF

DETERIORATION ALSO GAVE RISE TO A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ULTIMATE EXTENT OF

THE DOWNTURN. THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO WAS AFFECTED BY THESE MARKET CONDITIONS AND EXPERIENCED

CONTINUED DETERIORATING CREDIT QUALITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR, GENERALLY

CONSISTENT WITH THE MARKET.

FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, CRITICIZED ASSETS, NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND CHARGE-OFFS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 2008, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY IN COMMERCIAL

REAL ESTATE. IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR, THERE WERE SOME POSITIVE INDICATORS, FOR EXAMPLE, LOAN

ORIGINATION ACTIVITY AND MARKET LIQUIDITY IMPROVED AND CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTENED. THE WHOLESALE

BUSINESSES HAVE REMAINED FOCUSED ON ACTIVELY MANAGING THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH

REVIEWS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS. UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING HAVE REMAINED UNDER REVIEW AND STRENGTHENED WHERE APPROPRIATE,

CONSISTENT WITH EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IN LIGHT OF

THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO HAS BEEN

STRENGTHENED TO 3.57% FROM 2.64% AT THE END OF 2008.

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CREDIT PERFORMANCE CONTINUED TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT OF 2009. HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAKER OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOANS CHARGED OFF, WHILE CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES HAVE

DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF LOSS RECOGNIZED ON REAL ESTATE LOANS THAT

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES PAGES 103104 AND NOTE 5 ON PAGES 167175 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(C)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, NONPERFORMING LOANS AND ASSETS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS

INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $9.0 BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; (2) REAL

ESTATE OWNED INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $579 MILLION AND $364 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY; AND (3) STUDENT LOANS THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE

INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM OF $542

MILLION AND $437 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED, AS REIMBURSEMENT IS

PROCEEDING NORMALLY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS

FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER GUIDANCE

ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE

CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN

60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE

BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(D)

EXCLUDES PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS,

THE PAST DUE STATUS OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT

MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE

ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING.

(E)

NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS WERE CALCULATED USING: (1) AVERAGE RETAINED LOANS OF $672.3 BILLION AND

$567.0 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY; (2) AVERAGE

SECURITIZED LOANS OF $85.4 BILLION AND $79.6 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY; AND (3) AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS OF $757.7 BILLION AND $646.6 BILLION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

(F)

FIRMWIDE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS WERE CALCULATED INCLUDING AVERAGE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS OF $85.4 BILLION AND $22.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, THE TOTAL FIRMS MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 4.37% AND 2.15% RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) DECREASED BY $170.5

BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE $170.5 BILLION DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF

$82.4 BILLION OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, $57.9 BILLION OF LOANS AND $32.7 BILLION OF

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE DECREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO

TIGHTENING CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND RISING RATES ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS DECREASED ACROSS MOST WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS, AS LOWER

CUSTOMER DEMAND CONTINUED TO AFFECT THE LEVEL OF LENDING ACTIVITY.

EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIES THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT

CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE PRECEDING PAGE.



REAL ESTATE: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY DECREASED BY 15% OR $11.8 BILLION FROM 2008 AS LOANS

AND COMMITMENTS WERE MANAGED DOWN, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH REPAYMENTS AND LOANS SALES. THIS

SECTOR CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING AS PROPERTY VALUES IN THE U.S. REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE,

PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN REGIONS. THE RATIOS OF NONPERFORMING LOANS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS TO

LOANS HAVE INCREASED FROM 2008 DUE TO DETERIORATION IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO,

PARTICULARLY IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2009. THE MULTI-FAMILY PORTFOLIO, WHICH REPRESENTS ALMOST

HALF OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE, ACCOUNTS FOR THE

SMALLEST PROPORTION OF

NONPERFORMING LOANS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE COMMERCIAL LESSORS PORTFOLIO INVOLVES REAL ESTATE

LEASED TO RETAIL, INDUSTRIAL AND OFFICE SPACE TENANTS, WHILE THE COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES FINANCING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE AND

PROFESSIONAL BUILDINGS AND MALLS. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE IN CB IS PREDOMINANTLY SECURED;

CBS EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE. IB MANAGES

LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE TOTAL FIRMS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE; IBS EXPOSURE REPRESENTS

PRIMARILY UNSECURED LENDING TO REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REITS), LODGING, AND HOMEBUILDING

CLIENTS. THE INCREASE IN CRITICIZED REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES WITHIN

THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO REFLECTING THE CONTINUED WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY DECREASED BY 28% OR $21.5

BILLION FROM 2008, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL BANKS.



AUTOMOTIVE: CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. HAD IMPROVED BY THE END OF 2009, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF

THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED RESTRUCTURING OF GENERAL MOTORS AND CHRYSLER IN THE FIRST HALF OF

2009 AND THE RELATED EFFECTS ON AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS. EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY DECREASED BY

18% OR $2.1 BILLION AND CRITICIZED EXPOSURE DECREASED 30% OR $535 MILLION FROM 2008, LARGELY

DUE TO LOAN REPAYMENTS AND SALES. MOST OF THE FIRMS REMAINING CRITICIZED EXPOSURE IN THIS

SEGMENT REMAINS PERFORMING AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY SECURED.



LEISURE: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY DECREASED BY 16% OR $1.3 BILLION FROM 2008 DUE TO LOAN

REPAYMENTS AND SALES, PRIMARILY IN GAMING. WHILE EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY DECLINED, THE

CRITICIZED COMPONENT REMAINED ELEVATED

DUE TO THE CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE INDUSTRY,

PARTICULARLY IN GAMING. THE GAMING PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO BE MANAGED ACTIVELY.



ALL OTHER: ALL OTHER IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION TABLE ON PAGES 9899 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 (EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR

VALUE) INCLUDED $135.8 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SEVEN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED TO

SPES AND TO INDIVIDUALS, PRIVATE EDUCATION & CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS WERE 44% AND 47%,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING (GENERALLY BACKED BY

RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR BONDS) ORIGINATED BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF COMPANIES IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

NOT HIGHLY CORRELATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 206214 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND NONE

COMPRISE MORE THAN 1.0% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

TO NONPERFORMING RETAINED LOANS RESULTING IN ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIOS OF 31% AND 30%, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING LOANS REPRESENT 3.38% AND 0.91% OF TOTAL WHOLESALE LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

(B)

NONPERFORMING DERIVATIVES REPRESENT LESS THAN 1.0% OF THE TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES NET OF

CASH COLLATERAL AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS,

FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

RETAINED WHOLESALE LOANS WERE $200.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $248.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE $48.0 BILLION DECREASE, ACROSS MOST WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS, REFLECTED

LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND. LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE RELATE PRIMARILY TO SYNDICATED

LOANS AND LOANS TRANSFERRED FROM THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND LOANS CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE WERE $4.1 BILLION AND $14.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE

DECREASES IN BOTH HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE REFLECTED SALES, REDUCED CARRYING

VALUES AND LOWER VOLUMES IN THE SYNDICATION MARKET.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE THROUGH LOAN AND COMMITMENT SALES. DURING 2009

AND 2008, THE FIRM SOLD $3.9 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS IN EACH YEAR, RECOGNIZING LOSSES OF

$38 MILLION AND $41 MILLION IN EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS INCLUDE GAINS OR LOSSES ON

SALES OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, IF ANY, AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 102 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE

ACTIVITIES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR

LIQUIDITY AND BALANCE SHEETMANAGEMENT PURPOSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY,

SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 8892 AND 198205, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

NONPERFORMING WHOLESALE LOANS WERE $6.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN INCREASE OF $4.5 BILLION

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, REFLECTING CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, PREDOMINANTLY

RELATED TO LOANS IN THE REAL ESTATE, LEISURE AND BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES INDUSTRIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHOLESALE LOANS RESTRUCTURED AS PART OF A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF WHOLESALE LOANS AND

NONPERFORMING LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. THE

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS DETERMINED BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON THE

(A)

IN 2009, CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN INTEREST RATE

CONTRACTS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH

INDUSTRY PRACTICE. THE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE RESULTED IN A

RECLASSIFICATION OF $14.1 BILLION OF CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF $80.2

BILLION AND $162.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, ARE THE AMOUNT OF THE MTM

OR FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING

AGREEMENTS, CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AND CVA. THESE AMOUNTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK

SHOULD ALSO REFLECT ADDITIONAL LIQUID SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL BY THE FIRM OF $15.5 BILLION

AND $19.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN TOTAL EXPOSURE, NET OF

ALL COLLATERAL, OF $64.7 BILLION AND $142.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE OF $78.1 BILLION IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED COLLATERAL,

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TIGHTENING CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES AND RISING RATES ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS,

AS WELL AS COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY AND COLLATERAL THAT

THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THOUGH THIS

COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE BALANCES NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY

AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM HELD $16.9 BILLION AND $22.2

BILLION OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, RESPECTIVELY. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS,

SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE),

AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. DRE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED

TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED

LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY

AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF

POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE

TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE

CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CVA, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AVG EXPOSURE WAS $49.0 BILLION AND $83.7

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET

OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $64.7 BILLION AND $142.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE

COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE

PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES

IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO

CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE

COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT QUALITY WITHIN THE CREDIT APPROVAL PROCESS. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO

CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE ACCOMPANYING GRAPH  SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE

DRE AND AVG METRICS.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS

SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS  EXCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE SPOT TRADES, WHICH ARE NOT TYPICALLY

COVERED BY COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS DUE TO THEIR SHORT MATURITY  WAS 89% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009,

LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM 88% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE FIRM POSTED $56.7 BILLION AND $99.1 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY

AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THE RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS OF THEIR LEGAL

ENTITIES, TO POST COLLATERAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE IMPACT

OF A SINGLE-NOTCH AND SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES,

PRIMARILY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $1.2 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO

PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE TO A SPECIFIED RATING OF EITHER

THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL CONTRACTS THAT ISOLATE CREDIT RISK FROM AN

UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT (SUCH AS A LOAN OR SECURITY) AND TRANSFERS THAT RISK FROM ONE PARTY (THE BUYER

OF CREDIT PROTECTION) TO ANOTHER (THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION). THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER

AND SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION. AS A PURCHASER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE

COUNTERPARTY PROVIDING THE CREDIT PROTECTION

WILL DEFAULT. AS A SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE

FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT

EVENT. OF THE FIRMS $80.2 BILLION OF TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $18.8

BILLION, OR 23%, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE BENEFIT OF LIQUID SECURITIES

COLLATERAL.

ONE TYPE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH COUNTERPARTIES ARE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

(CDS). FOR FURTHER DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 5

ON PAGES 167175 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE LARGE MAJORITY OF CDS ARE SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

ARRANGEMENTS TO PROTECT THE FIRM FROM COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. IN 2009, THE FREQUENCY AND SIZE OF

DEFAULTS FOR BOTH TRADING COUNTERPARTIES AND THE UNDERLYING DEBT REFERENCED IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES

WERE WELL ABOVE HISTORICAL NORMS. THE USE OF COLLATERAL TO SETTLE AGAINST DEFAULTING COUNTERPARTIES

GENERALLY PERFORMED AS DESIGNED IN SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATING THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THESE

COUNTERPARTIES.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER

IN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS; AND SECOND, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE

FIRMS OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OVERALL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL

COMMERCIAL CREDIT LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS).

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS

WITHIN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS, THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY BUYING AND

SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, ACCORDING TO CLIENT DEMAND

FOR CREDIT RISK PROTECTION ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE INSTRUMENTS. PROTECTION MAY BE BOUGHT OR

SOLD BY THE FIRM ON SINGLE REFERENCE DEBT INSTRUMENTS (SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DERIVATIVES),

PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCED INSTRUMENTS (PORTFOLIO CREDIT DERIVATIVES) OR QUOTED INDICES (INDEXED

CREDIT DERIVATIVES). THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED AS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN

REFERENCE ENTITY UNDER A CONTRACT TO SELL PROTECTION TO A COUNTERPARTY MAY BE OFFSET PARTIALLY, OR

ENTIRELY, WITH A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE PROTECTION FROM ANOTHER COUNTERPARTY ON THE SAME UNDERLYING

INSTRUMENT. ANY RESIDUAL DEFAULT EXPOSURE AND SPREAD RISK IS ACTIVELY MANAGED BY THE FIRMS VARIOUS

TRADING DESKS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD DECREASED BY $2.4

TRILLION FROM YEAR-END 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INDUSTRY EFFORTS TO

REDUCE OFFSETTING TRADE ACTIVITY.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING

LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. THE FIRM ALSO MANAGES ITS

WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE BY PURCHASING PROTECTION THROUGH SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT

DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO OFFSET THE

UNREALIZED INCREASE OR DECREASE IN CREDIT RISK ON THE LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OR

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT REDUCE THE REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE

SHEET OR THE LEVEL OF REPORTED OFFBALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS, ALTHOUGH IT DOES PROVIDE THE FIRM

WITH CREDIT RISK PROTECTION. THE FIRM ALSO DIVERSIFIES ITS EXPOSURES BY SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION,

WHICH INCREASES EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIES OR CLIENTS WHERE THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CLIENT-RELATED

EXPOSURE; HOWEVER, THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES,

TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN ON THESE

COMMITMENTS OR THE FIRM FULFILLS ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, AND THE COUNTERPARTIES

SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS.

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE $347.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH

$379.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, REFLECTING LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF

THE FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR

ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT

AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER

CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED ON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

DRAWN UPON IN AN EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF THE FIRMS

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE $179.8 BILLION AND $204.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY.

EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNAL PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING EXPOSURES TO EMERGING

MARKETS COUNTRIES. THERE IS NO COMMON DEFINITION OF EMERGING MARKETS, BUT THE FIRM GENERALLY

INCLUDES IN ITS DEFINITION THOSE COUNTRIES WHOSE SOVEREIGN DEBT RATINGS ARE EQUIVALENT TO A+ OR

LOWER. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING COUNTRY EXPOSURES,

THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SOVEREIGN

CRISES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE, BY COUNTRY, TO THE TOP TEN EMERGING MARKETS. THE

SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRMS LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY AND NOT THE

FIRMS VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS. EXPOSURE IS REPORTED BASED ON

THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED. EXPOSURE

AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR COLLATERAL AND FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G., GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF

CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES; OUTSTANDINGS SUPPORTED BY A GUARANTOR LOCATED OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY OR BACKED BY COLLATERAL HELD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE

ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES AND OTHER SHORT CREDIT OR

EQUITY TRADING POSITIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE TABLE BELOW. TOTAL EXPOSURE INCLUDES EXPOSURE TO BOTH

GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME

EQUITY LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, AUTO LOANS, STUDENT LOANS AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, WITH A PRIMARY

FOCUS ON SERVING THE PRIME CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. THE PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES HOME EQUITY LOANS

AND LINES OF CREDIT SECURED BY JUNIOR LIENS, MORTGAGE LOANS WITH INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT OPTIONS TO

PREDOMINANTLY PRIME BORROWERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN PAYMENT-OPTION LOANS ACQUIRED FROM WASHINGTON

MUTUAL THAT MAY RESULT IN NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CONSUMER LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE

IDENTIFIED AS CREDIT-IMPAIRED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING PRODUCT

TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, FICO SCORES AND DELINQUENCY STATUS. THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS, AND THE POOLS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING. AT THE TIME

OF THE ACQUISITION, THESE LOANS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT

WERE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOAN POOLS. THEREFORE, NO

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE TRANSACTION DATE. IN 2009,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HIGHER EXPECTED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES FOR CERTAIN

POOLS OF THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS FOR THESE POOLS. AS A RESULT, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.6 BILLION WAS ESTABLISHED.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE PRODUCT SPECTRUM CONTINUES TO BE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAKER OVERALL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOANS CHARGED OFF, WHILE CONTINUED

WEAK HOUSING PRICES HAVE DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF LOSS RECOGNIZED ON REAL

ESTATE LOANS THAT DEFAULT. DELINQUENCIES AND NONPERFORMING LOANS CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN 2009. THE

INCREASES IN THESE CREDIT QUALITY METRICS WERE DUE, IN PART, TO FORECLOSURE MORATORIUM PROGRAMS,

WHICH ENDED IN EARLY 2009. THESE MORATORIUMS HALTED STAGES OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS WHILE THE

U.S. TREASURY DEVELOPED ITS HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (I.E., MHA) AND THE FIRM

ENHANCED ITS

FORECLOSURE-PREVENTION PROGRAMS. DUE TO A HIGH VOLUME OF FORECLOSURES AFTER THE MORATORIUMS,

PROCESSING TIMELINES FOR FORECLOSURES WERE ELONGATED BY APPROXIMATELY 100 DAYS. LOSSES RELATED TO

THESE LOANS CONTINUED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS NORMAL CHARGE-OFF PRACTICES,

BUT SOME DELINQUENT LOANS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN FORECLOSED UPON REMAIN IN THE MORTGAGE AND

HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIOS. ADDITIONAL DETERIORATION IN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT,

INCLUDING CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN THE LABOR AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS, COULD CAUSE

DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES TO INCREASE BEYOND THE FIRMS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS.

SINCE MID-2007, THE FIRM HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER LOANS BY TIGHTENING

BOTH UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS FOR BOTH REAL ESTATE AND NON-REAL ESTATE LENDING

PRODUCTS. FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING, TIGHTER INCOME VERIFICATION, MORE CONSERVATIVE

COLLATERAL VALUATION, REDUCED LOAN-TO-VALUE MAXIMUMS, AND HIGHER FICO AND CUSTOM RISK SCORE

REQUIREMENTS ARE JUST SOME OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO DATE TO MITIGATE RISK RELATED TO NEW

ORIGINATIONS. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THESE ACTIONS HAVE BETTER ALIGNED LOAN PRICING WITH THE

UNDERLYING CREDIT RISK OF THE LOANS. IN ADDITION, ORIGINATIONS OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, STATED

INCOME AND BROKER-ORIGINATED MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED ENTIRELY TO

FURTHER REDUCE ORIGINATIONS WITH HIGH-RISK CHARACTERISTICS. THE FIRM HAS NEVER ORIGINATED OPTION

ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES. THE TIGHTENING OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA FOR AUTO LOANS HAS RESULTED IN

THE REDUCTION OF BOTH EXTENDED-TERM AND HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE FINANCING.

AS A FURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS,

THE FIRM HAS REDUCED OR CANCELED CERTAIN LINES OF CREDIT AS PERMITTED BY LAW. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM

MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE

OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF

THE BORROWER. SIMILARLY, CERTAIN INACTIVE CREDIT CARD LINES HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND A NUMBER OF ACTIVE

CREDIT CARD LINES HAVE BEEN REDUCED.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ANTICIPATE,

THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT WOULD BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. FOR CREDIT CARD

COMMITMENTS AND HOME EQUITY COMMITMENTS (IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET), THE FIRM CAN REDUCE

OR CANCEL THESE LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES,

WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

(I)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, NONPERFORMING LOANS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $9.0 BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND (2) STUDENT LOANS

THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM, OF $542 MILLION AND $437 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED, AS REIMBURSEMENT IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRMS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF

THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING

NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(J)

EXCLUDES PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS,

THE PAST DUE STATUS OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT

MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE

ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING.

(K)

AVERAGE CONSUMER LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE WERE $2.2 BILLION AND $2.8

REAL ESTATE OWNED INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $579 MILLION AND $364 MILLION,

BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G.,

BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN PRODUCT AND LENDING-RELATED

CATEGORIES WITHIN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO. PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM

INDIVIDUAL LOAN PRODUCT DISCUSSIONS AND ADDRESSED SEPARATELY BELOW.

HOME EQUITY.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE $101.4 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $12.9

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2008. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER LOAN ORIGINATIONS, COUPLED WITH

LOAN PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS. THE 2009 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO

INCLUDED NET INCREASES OF $2.1 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

THE WEAK HOUSING PRICES AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT. SENIOR LIEN NONPERFORMING LOANS INCREASED FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WHILE JUNIOR LIEN NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE

RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. NET CHARGE-OFFS HAVE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES.

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH INCLUDE PRIME MORTGAGES, SUBPRIME MORTGAGES,

ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES (OPTION ARMS) ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND

MORTGAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE $88.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN $8.5 BILLION DECREASE FROM

YEAR-END 2008. THE DECREASE IS DUE TO LOWER PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS RETAINED IN THE PORTFOLIO AND

HIGHER LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, AS WELL AS THE RUN-OFF OF THE SUBPRIME AND OPTION ARM PORTFOLIOS. NET

CHARGE-OFFS HAVE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS OF THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO

BOTH HIGHER FREQUENCY AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES.

PRIME MORTGAGES OF $67.3 BILLION DECREASED $5.2 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE 2009

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDED A NET INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES IMPROVED

IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR, WHILE LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES HAVE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF PRIOR

FORECLOSURE MORATORIUMS AND ONGOING TRIAL MODIFICATION ACTIVITY, DRIVING AN INCREASE IN

NONPERFORMING LOANS.

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OF $12.5 BILLION DECREASED $2.8 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS A RESULT OF

PAYDOWNS, DISCONTINUATION OF NEW ORIGINATIONS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON DELINQUENT LOANS. THE 2009

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDED A NET INCREASE OF $625 MILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGH LOSS SEVERITIES DRIVEN BY DECLINING HOME PRICES.

OPTION ARMS OF $8.5 BILLION REPRESENT LESS THAN 5% OF NON-PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED REAL ESTATE

LOANS AND WERE $482 MILLION LOWER THAN DECEMBER 31, 2008, DUE TO RUN-OFF OF THE PORTFOLIO. THIS

PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF LOANS WITH LOW LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND HIGH BORROWER FICOS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CURRENTLY EXPECTS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER LOSSES ON THIS PORTFOLIO WHEN COMPARED

WITH THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED OPTION ARM PORTFOLIO. THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNPAID INTEREST

ADDED TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE DUE TO NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION OF OPTION ARMS WAS $78 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. NEW ORIGINATIONS OF OPTION ARMS WERE DISCONTINUED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL PRIOR TO THE DATE OF JPMORGAN CHASES

ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL. THE FIRM HAS NOT ORIGINATED, AND DOES NOT ORIGINATE, OPTION ARMS.

108

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AUTO LOANS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AUTO LOANS WERE $46.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $3.4 BILLION

FROM YEAR-END 2008, PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF NEW ORIGINATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S.

GOVERNMENTS CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM IN THE THIRD QUARTER. DELINQUENT LOANS WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER

THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOSS SEVERITIES ALSO DECREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER USED-CAR PRICES

NATIONWIDE. THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF PRIME QUALITY CREDITS.

CREDIT CARD.

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS

THROUGH SECURITIZATIONS. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES WERE $163.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009,

A DECREASE OF $26.9 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2008, REFLECTING LOWER CHARGE VOLUME AND A HIGHER LEVEL

OF CHARGE-OFFS.

THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE INCREASED TO 6.28% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, FROM 4.97% AT DECEMBER

31, 2008, AND THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE INCREASED TO 9.33% IN 2009, FROM 5.01% IN

2008. THESE INCREASES REFLECT THE CURRENT WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN METROPOLITAN

STATISTICAL AREAS (MSAS) EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST HOUSING PRICE DEPRECIATION AND HIGHEST

UNEMPLOYMENT AND TO THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS INCREASED BY $2.0 BILLION FOR 2009, REFLECTING A PROVISION FOR

LOAN LOSSES OF $2.4 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF $298 MILLION RELATED TO AN

ISSUANCE AND RETENTION OF SECURITIES FROM THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST. THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A WELL-SEASONED, LARGELY REWARDS-BASED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S.

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO, WERE $143.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $162.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE 30-DAY MANAGED

DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 5.52% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, UP FROM 4.36% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008; THE MANAGED

CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE, EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO INCREASED TO 8.45% IN

2009 FROM 4.92% IN 2008.

MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO WERE $19.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $28.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST, THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIOS 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE

WAS 12.72% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH 9.14% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND THE 2009 NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 18.79%.

ALL OTHER.

ALL OTHER LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE BUSINESS BANKING LOANS (WHICH ARE HIGHLY

COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN GUARANTEES), STUDENT LOANS, AND OTHER SECURED AND

UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OTHER LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE

$33.6 BILLION, DOWN $2.0 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2008, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER BUSINESS

BANKING LOANS. THE 2009 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED A NET INCREASE OF $580 MILLION TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $826 MILLION RELATED TO THE

BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIOS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WEAK ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS WERE $81.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009,

COMPARED WITH $88.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THIS PORTFOLIO REPRESENTS LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THESE LOANS INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OVER THE

REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS, AND THEREFORE NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE

LOANS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE.

THE FIRM REGULARLY UPDATES THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS TO BE

COLLECTED FOR THESE LOANS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS TRIGGER THE

RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS WOULD FIRST RESULT IN THE REVERSAL OF ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES. ANY REMAINING INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED

PROSPECTIVELY IN INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS.

DURING 2009, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HIGHER EXPECTED PRINCIPAL CREDIT LOSSES

FOR THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PRIME MORTGAGE AND OPTION ARM POOLS WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THESE POOLS. AS A RESULT, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.1 BILLION AND

$491 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THESE POOLS. THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER

POOLS HAS GENERALLY BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE ESTIMATE OF LOSSES AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

ACCORDINGLY, NO IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE OTHER POOLS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED.

EXCLUDING THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE LOANS WITH CURRENT ESTIMATED COMBINED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS (LTVS) IN EXCESS OF 100% AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2009 AND 2008, EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THE CURRENT

ESTIMATED COMBINED LTV RATIOS IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLE WERE DERIVED FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURED AT THE MSAS

LEVEL. BECAUSE HOME PRICE INDICES CAN HAVE WIDE VARIABILITY AND SUCH DERIVED REAL ESTATE VALUES DO

NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES, THE RESULTING RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY

IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE. THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF LOANS

IS IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH REPRESENTS 18% OF TOTAL ON-BALANCE SHEET CONSUMER LOANS AND 24% OF TOTAL

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT DECEMBER 2009, COMPARED TO 19% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER

2008. OF THE TOTAL ON-BALANCE SHEET CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO, $149.4 BILLION, OR 43%, ARE

CONCENTRATED IN CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, ARIZONA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN AT DECEMBER 2009 COMPARED TO

$171.1 BILLION, OR 43%, AT DECEMBER 2008.

DECLINING

HOME PRICES HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE UNDERLYING THE FIRMS

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN PORTFOLIO. IN GENERAL, THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS WITH HIGH

CURRENT ESTIMATED COMBINED

LTV

RATIOS IS GREATER THAN THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS IN WHICH THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE

COLLATERAL. WHILE A LARGE PORTION OF THE LOANS WITH CURRENT ESTIMATED

COMBINED LTV RATIOS GREATER

THAN 100%

CONTINUE TO PAY AND ARE CURRENT, THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF THESE BORROWERS TO PAY IS

CURRENTLY UNCERTAIN. NONPERFORMING LOANS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TOTALED $9.6

BILLION, OF WHICH 64% WAS GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. OF THE

NONPERFORMING LOANS THAT WERE GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY

36% OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THESE LOANS HAS BEEN CHARGED-DOWN TO ESTIMATED COLLATERAL

VALUE.

BALANCES WAS 11.24% AND 5.14% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSUMER 30+ DAY DELINQUENCIES HAVE INCREASED TO 6.23% OF THE CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, IN COMPARISON TO 4.44% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DRIVEN PREDOMINATELY BY AN INCREASE IN

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DELINQUENCIES WHICH INCREASED $3.4 BILLION. LATE STAGE DELINQUENCIES (150+

DAYS DELINQUENT) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACTS OF TRIAL LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND

FORECLOSURE MORATORIUM BACKLOGS. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS NORMAL CHARGE-OFF PRACTICES; AS SUCH, THESE LOANS ARE REFLECTED AT THEIR

ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE. EARLY STAGE DELINQUENCIES (30  89 DAYS DELINQUENT) IN THE RESIDENTIAL

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

PRESENTS THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COMBINED LTV RATIO, AS WELL AS THE RATIO OF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE, FOR PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

BECAUSE SUCH LOANS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE RATIO OF THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE

CURRENT ESTIMATED  COLLATERAL VALUE WILL BE LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATED

COMBINED LTV RATIO, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS WERE DERIVED FROM A

NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURED AT THE MSA LEVEL. BECAUSE HOME PRICE INDICES CAN

HAVE WIDE VARIABILITY, AND SUCH DERIVED REAL ESTATE VALUES DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED

LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES, THE RESULTING RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE

BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

AND 125%, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. LOAN CONCENTRATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA, AS

WELL AS THE CONTINUING DECLINE IN HOUSING PRICES IN THOSE STATES, HAVE CONTRIBUTED NEGATIVELY TO

BOTH THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COMBINED LTV RATIO AND THE RATIO OF CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT COLLATERAL VALUE

FOR LOANS IN THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO.

WHILE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS IS MARGINALLY BELOW THE CURRENT

COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE LOANS, THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

THE

BORROWERS BEHAVIOR AND ONGOING ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON HOMES

WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY AS WELL AS THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE HOUSING. THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

PORTFOLIO WAS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION WHICH INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE OF

LOSSES EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOAN POOLS. DURING 2009,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT HIGHER THAN EXPECTED FUTURE PRINCIPAL CREDIT LOSSES

WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS OF THE PRIME AND OPTION ARM POOLS.

AS A RESULT AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.6 BILLION WAS

ESTABLISHED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM REVIEWED ITS

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TO IDENTIFY HOMEOWNERS MOST IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE, OPENED NEW

REGIONAL COUNSELING CENTERS, HIRED ADDITIONAL LOAN COUNSELORS, INTRODUCED NEW FINANCING

ALTERNATIVES, PROACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO BORROWERS TO OFFER PRE-QUALIFIED MODIFICATIONS, AND

COMMENCED A NEW PROCESS TO INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW EACH LOAN BEFORE MOVING IT INTO THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS. IN ADDITION, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE U.S. TREASURY INTRODUCED THE MHA

PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSIST ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, ONE OF WHICH IS BY

MODIFYING THE TERMS OF THEIR MORTGAGES. THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE MHA PROGRAMS WHILE

CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO

NOT QUALIFY FOR THE MHA PROGRAMS. THE MHA PROGRAMS AND THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS

FOR FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BORROWERS GENERALLY REPRESENT VARIOUS CONCESSIONS SUCH AS TERM EXTENSIONS,

RATE REDUCTIONS AND DEFERRAL OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN REQUIRED UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT. WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT IN TROUBLED

DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE CANCELED AS PART

OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION. UNDER ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS, BORROWERS MUST MAKE AT LEAST THREE

PAYMENTS UNDER THE REVISED CONTRACTUAL TERMS DURING A TRIAL MODIFICATION PERIOD AND BE SUCCESSFULLY

RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE THEIR LOANS CAN BE PERMANENTLY MODIFIED. THE FIRMS

LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS TO THE FIRM, WHILE PROVIDING

ALTERNATIVES TO FORECLOSURE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON BORROWERS

ONGOING ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFIED TERMS AND COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL DETERIORATION IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OR SHIFTS IN BORROWER

BEHAVIOR. FOR BOTH THE FIRMS ON-BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND LOANS SERVICED FOR OTHERS, APPROXIMATELY

600,000 MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS HAD BEEN OFFERED TO BORROWERS IN 2009. OF THESE, 89,000 HAVE

ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LOANS CONTRACTUALLY MODIFIED TO DATE WERE

MODIFIED UNDER THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS MITIGATION PROGRAMS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS

INFORMATION RELATING TO RESTRUCTURED ON-BALANCE SHEET RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR WHICH

CONCESSIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009. MODIFICATIONS OF PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, AND THE IMPACT OF THE MODIFICATION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRMS

QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND/OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE PRINCIPAL

CASH FLOWS HAS OCCURRED. MODIFICATIONS OF LOANS OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED ARE GENERALLY

ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS.

AS PART OF THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, LOANS

ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE ASSET, LESS COSTS TO SELL. IN

THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM GAINS TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES AT

THE COMPLETION OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, THESE REO ASSETS ARE MANAGED FOR PROMPT SALE AND

DISPOSITION AT THE BEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC VALUE. ANY FURTHER GAINS OR LOSSES ON REO ASSETS ARE

RECORDED AS PART OF OTHER INCOME. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH

AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE

CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE. REO ASSETS DECLINED FROM YEAR-END 2008 AS A RESULT OF THE FORECLOSURE

MORATORIUM IN EARLY 2009 AND THE SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS

ANTICIPATED THAT REO ASSETS WILL INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS, AS LOANS MOVING THROUGH

THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PORTFOLIO TRANSFERS.

THE FIRM REGULARLY EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC RETURNS

AND MAKES AN INITIAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER NEW ORIGINATIONS WILL BE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT OR

SOLD WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE EXPECTED ECONOMIC

RETURNS OF PREVIOUSLY ORIGINATED LOANS UNDER PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

THEIR DESIGNATION AS HELD-FOR-SALE OR HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO BE APPROPRIATE. WHEN THE

FIRM DETERMINES THAT A CHANGE IN THIS DESIGNATION IS

APPROPRIATE, THE LOANS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE

APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION. SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, ALL NEW PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS THAT

CANNOT BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN

DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT. PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) AND CONSUMER

(PRIMARILY SCORED) LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES

INHERENT IN THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE

LOANS. DURING 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES

DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

WHOLESALE LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A

LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED; THIS DETERMINATION CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF

THE FIRMS CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN, AND

VALUATION OF THE BORROWERS EQUITY. CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, ARE

GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF

DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL POLICY. FOR

EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180

DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS OF RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY

OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO

AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, NO LATER THAN THE DATE

THE LOAN BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS, IF COLLATERALIZED, ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT ABOUT THE EFFECT

OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, HOUSING PRICES AND

OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS DETERMINATION OF LOAN

QUALITY. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THEN-PREVAILING FACTORS, MAY

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN

FUTURE PERIODS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK

POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009,

JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 127131 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 196198 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED BY $8.7 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR TO $32.5 BILLION.

EXCLUDING HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS,

LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, AND PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER

LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTED 5.51% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH

3.62% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED BY $7.8 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS

A RESULT OF AN INCREASED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD. THE

INCREASE INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $5.2 BILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS AS THE WEAK LABOR MARKET AND WEAK

OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED DELINQUENCIES, AND CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING

PRICES HAVE DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED

TO CREDIT CARD INCREASED $2.0 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE INCREASE REFLECTS AN ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR

LOAN LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF $298 MILLION RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE AND

RETENTION OF SECURITIES FROM THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST.

THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED BY $600 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008,

REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF A CONTINUED WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT AN ALLOWANCE FOR

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS HELD FOR THE FIRM, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES. THE

ALLOWANCE IS COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO,

MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGE 196198 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS FOR BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER, WHICH IS REPORTED IN

OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS $939 MILLION AND $659 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE REFLECTS DOWNGRADES WITHIN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO DUE TO THE CONTINUED WEAKENING

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT DURING 2009.

THE CREDIT RATIOS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE BASED ON RETAINED LOAN BALANCES, WHICH EXCLUDE LOANS

HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WHOLESALE

RETAINED LOANS WERE $200.1 BILLION AND $248.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND CONSUMER RETAINED LOANS

WERE $427.1 BILLION AND $480.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, AVERAGE WHOLESALE RETAINED LOANS WERE $223.0 BILLION AND $219.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND

AVERAGE CONSUMER RETAINED LOANS WERE $449.2 BILLION AND $347.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.6 BILLION WAS RECORDED FOR THE

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN EXCLUDED FROM APPLICABLE RATIOS. NO

ALLOWANCE WAS RECORDED FOR THE LOANS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER

TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. TO DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR ANY OF THESE

LOANS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDES A CREDIT RATIO EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: HOME LENDING

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION; AND CREDIT CARD

LOANS HELD BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST, WHICH WERE CONSOLIDATED ONTO THE FIRMS BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS WERE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, WHICH INCORPORATED MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE, AS

OF THAT DATE, OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

PORTFOLIO. ACCORDINGLY, NO ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF

ESTIMATED CREDIT DETERIORATION IN THIS PORTFOLIO RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES OF $1.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOME LENDING PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, SEE PAGES 109 AND 113 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $38.5 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, UP

BY $13.9 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIOR-YEAR INCLUDED A $1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM

WASHINGTON MUTUALS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH AFFECTED BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, THIS CHARGE IS EXCLUDED. THE

CONSUMER-MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $34.5 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009, COMPARED WITH $20.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES IN THE HOME LENDING AND CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIOS. INCLUDED IN THE 2009 ADDITION TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS A $1.6 BILLION INCREASE RELATED TO ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

WAS $4.0 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $2.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM

THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY WASHINGTON

MUTUAL (THE TRUST). AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT QUALITY CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK

RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE

OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION

EXPENSE WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS

RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON

MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, ALIGNED PRIMARILY WITH EACH OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. MARKET RISK WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY AND

MONITOR MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AS WELL AS TO DEFINE MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

MARKET RISK SEEKS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING

PERFORMANCE AND MAKE THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF BUSINESS SEGMENT MARKET RISK



DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS



PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF

MARKET RISKS WITHIN ITS UNITS. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF MARKET RISK ARE FOUND IN IB, CONSUMER

LENDING, AND THE FIRMS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE  IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT.

IB MAKES MARKETS AND TRADES ITS PRODUCTS ACROSS SEVERAL DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES. THESE ASSET

CLASSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FIXED INCOME RISK (BOTH INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK),

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES RISK. THESE TRADING RISKS MAY LEAD TO THE POTENTIAL

DECLINE IN NET INCOME DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IN ADDITION TO THESE TRADING RISKS,

THERE ARE RISKS IN IBS CREDIT PORTFOLIO FROM RETAINED LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVE CREDIT

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, HEDGES OF THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND MARK-TO-MARKET HEDGES OF THE

RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONAL RISK POSITIONS RESULT FROM THE DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

TAKEN ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS UNIT INCLUDES THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE

LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES. THESE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS

WELL AS OPTION AND BASIS RISK. OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN

MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY

CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE RATE INDICES

UNDERLYING MORTGAGE EXPOSURE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH MANAGING STRUCTURAL MARKET RISKS WHICH

ARISE OUT OF THE VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM. THESE INCLUDE STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE

RISK, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. MARKET RISK MEASURES AND MONITORS THE GROSS STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES

AS WELL AS THE NET EXPOSURES RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS

METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



VALUE-AT-RISK



LOSS ADVISORIES



DRAWDOWNS



ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING



EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT

VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, MARKET VALUES, POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER. THESE

MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY

LINE OF BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND

TACTICAL CONTROL.

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, VAR, ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE

MARKET MOVES IN A NORMAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF

RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES,

MONITORING LIMITS, AND AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. EACH BUSINESS DAY, AS PART OF

ITS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES

THE MAJORITY OF ITS MARKET RISKS. THESE VAR RESULTS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

118

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL SIMULATION, BASED ON A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND AN

EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY, WHICH MEASURES RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND PORTFOLIOS IN A

CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE WAY. THE SIMULATION IS BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THIS

APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES;

THIS ASSUMPTION MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ACCURATE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUCH AS LENDING FACILITIES AND SOME MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES

FOR WHICH PRICE-BASED TIME SERIES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, MARKET-BASED DATA ARE USED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH SENSITIVITY FACTORS TO ESTIMATE THE RISK. IT IS LIKELY THAT USING AN ACTUAL

PRICE-BASED TIME SERIES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD IMPACT THE VAR RESULTS PRESENTED.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN

RISK PARAMETERS, SUCH AS CORRELATION RISK AMONG CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT

FULLY CAPTURED IN VAR.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM REVISED ITS REPORTED IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR

MEASURE TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL RISK POSITIONS PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED FROM VAR, THUS CREATING A MORE

COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE FIRMS MARKET RISKS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MOVED TO CALCULATING VAR USING

A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL TO PROVIDE A MORE STABLE MEASURE OF THE VAR FOR DAY-TO-DAY RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE JPMORGAN CHASES VAR MEASURES UNDER BOTH THE LEGACY 99% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL AS WELL AS THE NEW 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE FIRM INTENDS TO PRESENT VAR SOLELY AT THE 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, AS INFORMATION FOR TWO COMPLETE

YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS WILL THEN BE AVAILABLE.

THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE RESULTS OF THE FIRMS VAR MEASURE USING THE LEGACY 99%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

119

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL TRADING VAR INCLUDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING ACTIVITIES IN IB. BEGINNING

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE PRODUCTS WERE

INCLUDED IN TRADING VAR. THIS CHANGE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AVERAGE FOURTH QUARTER VAR.

FOR CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN THE TRADING VAR, PARTICULAR RISK PARAMETERS ARE NOT FULLY

CAPTURED  FOR EXAMPLE, CORRELATION RISK. TRADING VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE: HELD-FOR-SALE FUNDED LOAN

AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS POSITIONS (HOWEVER, IT DOES INCLUDE HEDGES OF THOSE POSITIONS); THE DVA

TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM; THE MSR

PORTFOLIO; AND SECURITIES AND INSTRUMENTS HELD BY OTHER CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS PRIVATE

EQUITY. SEE THE DVA SENSITIVITY TABLE ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DETAILS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MSRS AND THE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148165, NOTE 17 ON PAGES

214217 AND CORPORATE/ PRIVATE EQUITY ON PAGES 7475 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2009 VAR RESULTS (99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR)

IBS AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR WAS $248 MILLION FOR 2009, COMPARED WITH $202

MILLION FOR 2008, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MARKET VOLATILITY. VOLATILITY BEGAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

ACROSS ALL ASSET CLASSES FROM LATE 2008 AND PERSISTED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. FROM THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 ONWARDS, VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS GRADUALLY DECLINED; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT

OF THE VOLATILE PERIODS WAS STILL REFLECTED IN THE 2009 VAR NUMBERS.

SPOT TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $146 MILLION, COMPARED

WITH $317 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE DECREASE IN THE SPOT VAR IN 2009 REFLECTS THE

REDUCTION IN OVERALL RISK LEVELS AS WELL AS THE AFOREMENTIONED DECLINE IN MARKET VOLATILITY BY THE

END OF 2009 WHEN COMPARED TO THE END OF 2008.

FOR 2009, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, AVERAGE TRADING VAR DIVERSIFICATION INCREASED TO $131

MILLION, OR 37% OF THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS, FROM $108 MILLION, OR 36% OF THE SUM OF THE

COMPONENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

CHANGE.

VAR BACKTESTING (99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR)

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST

DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE (EXCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS/(LOSSES)) PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED NET

INTEREST INCOME, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE. THE DAILY IB MARKET

RISK-RELATED REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES ON HELD-FOR-SALE FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED

COMMITMENTS AND FROM DVA. THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS

AND LOSSES FOR IB TRADING BUSINESSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2009. THE CHART SHOWS THAT IB POSTED MARKET

RISK-RELATED GAINS ON 219 OUT OF 261 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH 54 DAYS EXCEEDING $160 MILLION. THE

INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH IB EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH 99%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 42

DAYS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WITH NO LOSS EXCEEDING THE VAR MEASURE. THE FIRM

WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ONCE IN EVERY 100 TRADING

DAYS, OR ABOUT TWO TO THREE TIMES A YEAR.

VAR MEASUREMENT

THE FIRMS 95% VAR MEASURE ABOVE INCLUDES ALL THE RISK POSITIONS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE 99%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR MEASURE, AS WELL AS SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO

DISTRIBUTE. THE FIRM UTILIZES PROXIES TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE PRODUCTS SINCE DAILY TIME

SERIES ARE LARGELY NOT AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, THE 95% VAR MEASURE ALSO INCLUDES CERTAIN POSITIONS

UTILIZED AS PART OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WITHIN THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (CIO)

AND IN THE CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE A TOTAL IB AND OTHER VAR MEASURE. THE CIO VAR

INCLUDES POSITIONS, PRIMARILY IN DEBT SECURITIES AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, USED TO MANAGE STRUCTURAL

RISK AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND MORTGAGE RISKS ARISING FROM THE FIRMS

ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE CONSUMER LENDING VAR INCLUDES THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND

WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, INCLUDING THESE ITEMS IN VAR

PRODUCES A MORE COMPLETE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE.

THE 95% VAR MEASURE CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE THE DVA TAKEN ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND

DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM. IT ALSO EXCLUDES CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS

PRIVATE EQUITY, PRINCIPAL INVESTING (E.G., MEZZANINE FINANCING, TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS, ETC.) AND

BALANCE SHEET, CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY THE CIO. THESE

LONGER-TERM POSITIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE FIRMS EARNINGS-AT-RISK AND OTHER CASH

FLOW-MONITORING PROCESSES RATHER THAN BY USING A VAR MEASURE. PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND

PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS ARE MANAGED USING STRESS AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

2009 VAR RESULTS (95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR)

SPOT IB AND OTHER VAR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $123 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $286 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE DECREASE IN SPOT VAR IN 2009 IS A CONSEQUENCE OF REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL RISK

AS WELL AS DECLINING MARKET VOLATILITY. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

CHANGE.

VAR BACKTESTING (95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR)

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST THE

FIRMS MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR IB AND CIO (EXCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS/(LOSSES) AND REVENUE FROM

LONGER-TERM CIO INVESTMENTS); TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME FOR IB, RFS AND CIO (EXCLUDING

LONGER-TERM CIO INVESTMENTS); IB BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE; REVENUE

FROM SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE; AND MORTGAGE FEES AND

RELATED INCOME FOR THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES.

THE DAILY FIRMWIDE MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DVA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR IB

AND CONSUMER/CIO POSITIONS FOR 2009. THE CHART SHOWS THAT THE FIRM POSTED MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS

ON 227 OUT OF 261 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH 69 DAYS EXCEEDING $160 MILLION. THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS

AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH THE FIRM EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 34

DAYS DURING 2009 AND EXCEEDED THE VAR MEASURE ON ONE DAY DUE TO HIGH MARKET VOLATILITY IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009. UNDER THE 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR DAILY LOSSES

GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ABOUT TWELVE TIMES A YEAR.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROSS SENSITIVITY OF DVA TO A

ONE-BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREADS. THIS SENSITIVITY REPRESENTS THE IMPACT

FROM A ONE-BASIS-POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN JPMORGAN CHASES ENTIRE CREDIT CURVE. AS CREDIT CURVES DO

NOT TYPICALLY MOVE IN A PARALLEL FASHION, THE SENSITIVITY MULTIPLIED BY THE CHANGE IN SPREADS AT A

SINGLE MATURITY POINT MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

LOSS ADVISORIES AND DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE

CERTAIN LEVELS AND INITIATE DISCUSSION OF REMEDIES.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING

CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM

CONDUCTS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN

SIGNIFICANTLY, EQUITY PRICES DECLINE AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE MAJOR

CURRENCIES. OTHER SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS PREDOMINANT IN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

INCLUDE SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS.

SCENARIOS WERE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY IN 2009 AND, IN SOME CASES, REDEFINED TO REFLECT THE

SIGNIFICANT MARKET VOLATILITY WHICH BEGAN IN LATE 2008. ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS

IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AND STRESS LOSSES ARE MONITORED AGAINST LIMITS. STRESS

TESTING IS ALSO UTILIZED IN ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MEASUREMENT, AS WELL AS AN

INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION. STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS BASED ON CURRENT

MARKET RISK POSITIONS ARE REPORTED TO THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO

HELP THEM BETTER MEASURE AND MANAGE RISKS AND TO UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT. INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE

NONTRADING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/

LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON-AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS AND CAN OCCUR DUE

TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.



DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF LIABILITIES REPRICE QUICKER THAN ASSETS AND

FUNDING INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS THAT

ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE DEPOSIT LIABILITIES ARE REPRICING THAN

ASSETS WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE

(FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO

LEND AT LONG-TERM FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES). BASED ON

THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND

UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON ITS LIABILITIES (E.G., DEPOSITS) WITHOUT A

CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ITS ASSETS (E.G., LOANS). CONVERSELY,

HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ASSETS GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY

WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON LIABILITIES.



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE BORROWERS THAN FORECASTED PAY DOWN

HIGHER-RATE LOAN BALANCES WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS MAY DECREASE

INITIALLY.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED,

CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A

TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN

BE RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND

CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT

EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR REPRICING, AND ANY

INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE

DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES

UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN

THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME, AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE FIRMS PRETAX EARNINGS, OVER

THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. THESE TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS

THE RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY

AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE

FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES

AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE

SCENARIOS ARE ALSO REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE, NONPARALLEL RATE

SHIFTS AND SEVERE INTEREST RATE SHOCKS ON SELECTED KEY RATES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE INTENDED TO

PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS AT RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES.

JPMORGAN CHASES 12-MONTH PRETAX EARNINGS SENSITIVITY PROFILE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, IS

DOWN 100- AND 200-BASIS-POINT PARALLEL SHOCKS RESULT IN A FED FUNDS TARGET RATE OF ZERO, AND

NEGATIVE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH TREASURY RATES. THE EARNINGS-AT-RISK RESULTS OF SUCH A

LOW-PROBABILITY SCENARIO ARE NOT MEANINGFUL.

THE CHANGE IN EARNINGS AT RISK FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESULTS FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF AFS

SECURITIES AND AN UPDATED BASELINE SCENARIO THAT USES HIGHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. THE FIRMS

RISK TO RISING RATES IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF INCREASED FUNDING COSTS ON ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY WIDENING DEPOSIT MARGINS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY COMPRESSED DUE TO VERY LOW SHORT-TERM INTEREST

RATES.

ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, INVOLVING A STEEPER YIELD CURVE WITH LONG-TERM RATES

RISING 100 BASIS POINTS AND SHORT-TERM RATES STAYING AT CURRENT LEVELS, RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH

PRETAX EARNINGS BENEFIT OF $449 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS IS DUE TO REINVESTMENT OF

MATURING ASSETS AT THE HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES, WITH FUNDING COSTS REMAINING UNCHANGED.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL

TAX CHANGE, AND ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITIES OF LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH EVENTS. THIS INFORMATION

IS ENTERED INTO THE FIRMS RIFLE DATABASE. MANAGEMENT OF TRADING BUSINESSES CONTROL RIFLE ENTRIES,

THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY

STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK

APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE

FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRENDS

AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

FIRMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING

RISK LIMITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS

LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE-OF-BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED. LIMIT

BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS SEGMENT IS

REQUIRED TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS OR CONSULT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATE ACTION.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ALSO PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS AS NECESSARY OF BOTH BUSINESSES AND

PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL THEIR

MARKET RISK. STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED AND

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE

INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. THE MODEL RISK

GROUP, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF

THE BUSINESSES AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL

APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS

SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, INCLUDING WHETHER IT

ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE

SUITABILITY AND CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES,

CONSISTENCY OF THE TREATMENT WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED OF NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS

WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY

AND WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 127131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

NONSTATISTICAL EXPOSURES, VALUE-AT-RISK, LOSS ADVISORIES AND LIMIT EXCESSES ARE REPORTED DAILY TO

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TRENDS, VALUE-AT-RISK TRENDS, PROFIT-AND-LOSS CHANGES AND

PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS ARE REPORTED WEEKLY. STRESS-TEST RESULTS ARE REPORTED AT LEAST EVERY TWO

WEEKS TO THE BUSINESSES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAKES PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM HOLDING

PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK OF

POSITIONS HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS APPROACH TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING

EXPECTED LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE

PORTFOLIO. INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND INTENDED TO ENSURE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIO. ALL

INVESTMENTS ARE APPROVED BY AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT

INCLUDES EXECUTIVES WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO WAS $7.3 BILLION AND $6.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

WHICH $762 MILLION AND $483 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTED PUBLICLY-TRADED POSITIONS. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, SEE PAGE 75 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR

SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL

RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS

INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE

FIRM, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND

A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE

GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS

AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

ONE OF THE WAYS OPERATIONAL RISK IS MITIGATED IS THROUGH INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. THE

FIRM PURCHASES INSURANCE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS TO SERVE

OTHER NEEDS OF THE FIRM. INSURANCE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE FIRM DOES

BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE PURCHASED IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL

RISK SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF

OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND

ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER, THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS MONITORING

AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY

GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES. ALL BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE FIRMS STANDARD SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS

AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND

ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR

CONTROL ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE

ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS MEASURED FOR EACH BUSINESS ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE USING A

STATISTICALLY BASED LOSS-DISTRIBUTION APPROACH. THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIAL STRESS

SCENARIOS AND MEASURES OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT ARE THEN FACTORED INTO THE STATISTICAL MEASURE IN

DETERMINING THE FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL. THIS METHODOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

ADVANCED MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS

AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY

RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED ENABLES THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST

AGAINST SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE FIRM IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE OPERATIONAL RISKDATA EXCHANGE

ASSOCIATION, A NOT-FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING OPERATIONAL

LOSS DATA, SHARING DATA IN AN ANONYMOUS FORM AND BENCHMARKING RESULTS BACK TO MEMBERS. SUCH

INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTS THE FIRMS ONGOING OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION

ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL

RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE

CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

AND REPORTING. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS AND

ACCURACY OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND THE LOSS DATA-COLLECTION AND REPORTING

ACTIVITIES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET

AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE AMONG

MANY CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS

THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A REPUTATION

FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION ALWAYS HAS BEEN A KEY ASPECT

OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRMS REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE

AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH

THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, MAINTAINING ADHERENCE TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND

OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE LINE-OF-BUSINESSES

RISK COMMITTEES, A CONFLICTS OFFICE, WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO

CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM; AND A REPUTATION RISK OFFICE AND REGIONAL REPUTATION

RISK COMMITTEES, WHICH REVIEW CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT ADVERSELY THE

FIRMS REPUTATION. THESE REGIONAL COMMITTEES, WHOSE MEMBERS ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF

BUSINESSES AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS IN THE REGION, FOCUS AMONG OTHER THINGS ON COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND

STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS NOT BE USED TO

MISLEAD THE CLIENTS INVESTORS OR OTHERS.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS INCLUDE IN THEIR MANDATE OVERSIGHT OF

THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES THAT MAY

PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS

WITH THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES

PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO

CLIENTS PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT.

OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A

CLIENT, INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION; DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. IN

THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE

RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH

FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FIRMS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS

REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO

ASCERTAIN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND

CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART

OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD

TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR

CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR

DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE RETAINED WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN

PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS TO REFLECT

PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES

USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 196198 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION

OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN ESTABLISHING THE INPUTS USED TO

ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCES. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC

FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO, AND TO REFINE LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE

CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK-RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE

THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE

AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND

THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION

OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION.

EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE RISK RATING

ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES.

WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF LOSS,

INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO WHETHER THE LOSS ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER THE

ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE, AS WELL AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA

SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS

SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF

DIFFERENT INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE

BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET

REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND

DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS,

QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRMS WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, ASSUMING A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS FOR ITS

ENTIRE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WOULD

INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR ALL WHOLESALE LOANS WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME IS

REMOTE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT OF RISK RATINGS ON

THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR WHOLESALE LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION IN RISK RATINGS. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM

FOLLOWS IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RISK RATINGS

CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO WHOLESALE LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE.

CONSUMER LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, DELINQUENCY STATUS, FICO SCORES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, BORROWER BEHAVIOR

AND OTHER RISK FACTORS, AND IT IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF INCURRED

LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE

ENTIRE CONSUMER CREDIT PRODUCT SPECTRUM CONTINUES TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, AS THE WEAK LABOR MARKET AND OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED

DELINQUENCIES, WHILE CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES HAVE DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOSS

SEVERITY. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AS WELL AS ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON HOUSING PRICES AND THE LABOR MARKET. WHILE

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO BOTH HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, IN

THE CURRENT MARKET IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ONE OR BOTH OF THESE

FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE BOTH FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT

DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE LEVELS, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR OR THE OTHER MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE

SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY

OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE OTHER. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE

CONSISTENT ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO

WHICH CHANGES IN

BOTH OR EITHER OF THESE FACTORS WOULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF

LOSSES OR BOTH; AND OVERALL LOSS RATES ARE A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF

INDIVIDUAL LOAN LOSSES.

THE ALLOWANCE IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS

OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES IN THE

PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO

CATEGORY USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE CHARGE-OFFS.

MANAGEMENT USES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION

TRENDS TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATE. THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION  IS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND

CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND IS ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES

JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

THE  UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION

OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE

THAT ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

UNDER U.S. GAAP THERE IS A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. AN INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. THEREFORE, FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN

LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY, WHERE INPUTS ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA,

THERE IS LESS JUDGMENT APPLIED IN ARRIVING AT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT. THE FIRM REVIEWS AND UPDATES THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CLASSIFICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES FROM ONE QUARTER TO THE NEXT

RELATED TO THE OBSERVABILITY OF INPUTS TO A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT MAY RESULT IN A RECLASSIFICATION

BETWEEN HIERARCHY LEVELS.

GROSS OF ANY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH BALANCES, THE

VALUATION

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR

INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS. THE FIRMS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ALL

APPLICABLE INPUTS ARE APPROPRIATELY CALIBRATED TO MARKET DATA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD

CURVES, INTEREST RATES,

VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO

MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY. VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS,

CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS THAT ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.

FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE

MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3,

MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF

OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING

VALUATION INPUTS  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES,

EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION,

MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY. FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE

APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

QUALITY, THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, WHERE

RELEVANT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. THE

FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AN INDEPENDENT

MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC

PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS OF THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE VERIFICATION

GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS, ENSURES OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND

MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED FOR VALUATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL

PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE

ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING IS PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL

VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS; BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT; AND

DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER

TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE

INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP,

ARE BASED ON

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO CONFIRM THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND

PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES

TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. DURING 2009, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE FIRMS VALUATION

MODELS THAT HAD, OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS

RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE

APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD

RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148165

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IN ADDITION, FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND

ESTIMATES INVOLVED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FIRMS MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES, SEE

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 161162 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE  ACQUIRED CERTAIN LOANS

WITH EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION OF CREDIT QUALITY SINCE THE ORIGINATION AND FOR WHICH IT WAS

PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT THE FIRM WOULD BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED

PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE. THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS, AND

THE POOLS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING. AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION, THESE LOANS WERE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED OVER THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOAN POOLS. MANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE

ESTIMATION OF THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE AND THE ONGOING UPDATES TO MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE

CASH FLOWS ARE BOTH SIGNIFICANT AND SUBJECTIVE, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICE DECLINES, THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND THE LACK OF MARKET LIQUIDITY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE FACTORS THAT HAVE

INFLUENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO AFFECT, THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES.

DETERMINING WHICH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, CONSUMER LOANS WITH CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES (E.G.,

HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, BORROWERS WITH LOWER FICO SCORES, DELINQUENCIES) WERE DETERMINED TO BE

CREDIT-IMPAIRED, PROVIDED THAT THOSE ATTRIBUTES AROSE SUBSEQUENT TO THE LOANS ORIGINATION DATES. A

WHOLESALE LOAN WAS DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED IF IT WAS RISK-

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

129

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RATED SUCH THAT IT WOULD

OTHERWISE HAVE REQUIRED AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

LOANS DETERMINED TO BE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED WERE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH

INCLUDED ESTIMATED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES. IF SUCH LOANS HAD NOT BEEN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT THE

PRESENT VALUES OF AMOUNTS TO BE RECEIVED DETERMINED AT APPROPRIATE CURRENT INTEREST RATES, LESS AN

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (I.E., THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WOULD HAVE BEEN

CARRIED OVER AT THE ACQUISITION DATE).

THE FIRM ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE BY

DISCOUNTING THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AT A MARKET-OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN

AVAILABLE, ADJUSTED FOR FACTORS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE.

THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS TO BE COLLECTED WAS DERIVED FROM ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DEFAULT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES AND THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS.

THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THESE LOANS PROVIDES THAT THE EXCESS OF THE CASH FLOWS INITIALLY

EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOANS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE (I.E., THE

ACCRETABLE YIELD) SHOULD BE ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM

OF THE LOAN, PROVIDED THAT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE

INITIAL ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED MUST BE UPDATED EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING

PERIOD BASED ON UPDATED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND

TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. PROBABLE

DECREASES IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AFTER ACQUISITION TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF

IMPAIRMENT, THROUGH THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED BASED ON

THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL LOSS, PLUS ANY RELATED FOREGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS

DISCOUNTED AT THE POOLS EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS WOULD FIRST

REVERSE ANY RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; ANY REMAINING INCREASES MUST BE RECOGNIZED

PROSPECTIVELY AS INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS. THE IMPACTS OF (I)

PREPAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE INTEREST RATES AND (III) OTHER CHANGES IN TIMING OF EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME. AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE INITIAL

RECORDED AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS AND ON SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT

LOSSES AND/OR INTEREST INCOME. ESTIMATING THESE CASH FLOWS REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, A 1% DECREASE IN EXPECTED FUTURE PRINCIPAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR THE ENTIRE

PORTFOLIO OF PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES FOR THESE LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION.

FINALLY, THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE STATES THAT INVESTORS MAY AGGREGATE LOANS INTO POOLS THAT HAVE

COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS AND THEREBY USE A COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED FOR THE POOLS. THE FIRM HAS AGGREGATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS IDENTIFIED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION (I.E., THE RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE LOANS) INTO POOLS

WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. THE POOLS THEN BECOME THE UNIT OF

ACCOUNTING AND ARE CONSIDERED ONE LOAN FOR PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTING FOR THESE LOANS AT AND SUBSEQUENT

TO ACQUISITION. ONCE A POOL IS ASSEMBLED, THE INTEGRITY OF THE POOL MUST BE MAINTAINED. SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING WHETHER INDIVIDUAL LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS FOR

PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING POOLS OF LOANS.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER U.S. GAAP, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY. THE FIRMS PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY USED TO CONDUCT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING (A) THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS AND (B)

THE RELEVANT COST OF EQUITY OR TERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATES CAN AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS

EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES BY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS (FAIR VALUE AS A PERCENT OF CARRYING VALUE

RANGED FROM 140% TO 500%) AND THUS, DID NOT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND VALUATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES IN RFS AND CS HAVE

ELEVATED RISK DUE TO THEIR EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK. THE VALUATION OF THESE BUSINESSES

AND THEIR ASSETS ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT UPON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES

AND HOME PRICES) THAT AFFECT CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND BEHAVIOR, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE

AND REGULATORY CHANGES THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES. THE ASSUMPTIONS

USED IN THE VALUATION OF THESE BUSINESSES INCLUDE PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING BALANCES, NET INTEREST

MARGIN, OPERATING EXPENSE AND FORECASTED CREDIT LOSSES AND WERE MADE USING MANAGEMENTS BEST

PROJECTIONS. THE COST OF EQUITY USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL REFLECTED THE ESTIMATED RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THESE BUSINESSES AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON WITH RELEVANT MARKET PEERS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  CREDIT CARD LENDING BUSINESS WITHIN CS EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY

APPROXIMATELY 8%. THE FAIR VALUE OF A CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS WITHIN RFS DID NOT EXCEED ITS

CARRYING VALUE; HOWEVER, IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THIS CONSUMER LENDING

BUSINESS WITHIN RFS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE.

THE FIRM

DID NOT RECOGNIZE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, PROLONGED WEAKNESS OR

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS, OR ADDITIONAL REGULATORY

OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN PROJECTED BUSINESS

PERFORMANCE BEYOND MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS. THIS COULD CAUSE THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR

ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME

PORTION OF THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE

OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO

INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS, AS WELL AS

THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN ITEMS MAY AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX

JURISDICTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND EXAMINATION

BY THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FIRM OPERATES, AND DISPUTES MAY

OCCUR REGARDING ITS VIEW ON A TAX POSITION. THESE DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS

TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED BY AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OR ADJUDICATION BY THE COURT

SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS

WHETHER IT MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS,

AND THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS

ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS, LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS AND TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVISIONS IN THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES MAY MATERIALLY

AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

THE FIRMS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPOSED OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES. DEFERRED TAXES

ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING VERSUS

INCOME TAX RETURN PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, THEIR

REALIZABILITY IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THE FIRM PERFORMS REGULAR REVIEWS TO

ASCERTAIN THE REALIZABILITY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH ALSO INCORPORATES VARIOUS TAX

PLANNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING STRATEGIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSSES

BEFORE THEY EXPIRE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REVIEWS, IF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE

UNREALIZABLE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, MANAGEMENT HAS

DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF

THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD ARE

MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE. AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AT

THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED UPON

SETTLEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REASSESSMENT OCCURS.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION

IN JULY 2009, THE FASB IMPLEMENTED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (THE CODIFICATION)

AS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE

CODIFICATION SIMPLIFIES THE CLASSIFICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS INTO ONE ONLINE DATABASE UNDER A

COMMON REFERENCING SYSTEM, ORGANIZED INTO EIGHT AREAS, RANGING FROM INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC TO GENERAL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT MATTERS. USE OF THE CODIFICATION IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS

ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2009. THE FIRM BEGAN TO USE THE CODIFICATION ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE, AND

IT HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, THROUGHOUT THIS ANNUAL

REPORT, ALL REFERENCES TO PRIOR FASB, AICPA AND EITF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED,

AND ALL NON-SEC ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IS REFERRED TO IN TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE SUBJECT MATTER.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS/NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH AMENDED THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, AS WELL AS NONCONTROLLING (I.E., MINORITY) INTERESTS. FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, THE

GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT CLOSE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. THE

GUIDANCE FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, AS AMENDED, BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE FOR FISCAL

PERIODS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE, WHICH AMENDS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION.

THE AMENDED GUIDANCE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS GENERALLY ONLY IMPACTS THE ACCOUNTING FOR

TRANSACTIONS THAT CLOSED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND GENERALLY ONLY IMPACTS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

BUSINESS

COMBINATION ACCOUNTING, SUCH AS THE ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTION COSTS AND CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED

RESTRUCTURING RESERVES, AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNTING FOR PARTIAL ACQUISITIONS WHERE CONTROL IS

OBTAINED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. ONE EXCEPTION TO THE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE

BUSINESS-COMBINATION GUIDANCE RELATES TO ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS

THAT CLOSED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009. ONCE THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENT PERIOD CLOSES FOR

THESE ACQUISITIONS, ANY FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES RECORDED AS PART OF THESE BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS WILL IMPACT INCOME TAX EXPENSE. PREVIOUSLY, THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE PREDOMINANTLY

RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS TO GOODWILL.

THE GUIDANCE FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, AS AMENDED, REQUIRES THAT THEY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND

PRESENTED AS EQUITY IF MATERIAL, RATHER THAN AS A LIABILITY OR MEZZANINE EQUITY. THE PRESENTATION

AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE

ADOPTION OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND REPURCHASE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS

IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH REQUIRES AN INITIAL TRANSFER OF A FINANCIAL ASSET

AND A REPURCHASE FINANCING THAT WAS ENTERED INTO CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH, OR IN CONTEMPLATION OF,

THE INITIAL TRANSFER TO BE EVALUATED TOGETHER AS A LINKED TRANSACTION, UNLESS CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE

MET. THE FIRM ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2009, FOR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO AFTER THE DATE

OF ADOPTION. THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND THEIR

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, WHICH CLARIFIES THAT UNVESTED

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS CONTAINING NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENTS (COLLECTIVELY, DIVIDENDS), ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND THEREFORE

INCLUDED IN THE TWO-CLASS METHOD CALCULATION OF EPS. UNDER THIS METHOD, ALL EARNINGS (DISTRIBUTED

AND UNDISTRIBUTED) ARE ALLOCATED TO COMMON SHARES AND PARTICIPATING SECURITIES BASED ON THEIR

RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED

FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. THE

FIRM ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE RETROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, AND EPS DATA FOR ALL PRIOR

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY

1, 2009, DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH AMENDS THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR

DEBT SECURITIES. UNDER THE GUIDANCE, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY-IMPAIRMENT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IF AN

INVESTOR HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL BE

REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. IN ADDITION, THE

GUIDANCE CHANGES THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS WHEN AN

INVESTOR DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL, OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE

REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY, AS IN THESE CASES ONLY THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT ASSOCIATED

WITH CREDIT LOSSES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. THE GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

REGARDING THE CALCULATION OF CREDIT LOSSES, AS WELL AS FACTORS CONSIDERED IN REACHING A CONCLUSION

THAT AN INVESTMENT IS NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM

AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED FOR PERIODS

ENDING AFTER MARCH 15, 2009. THE FIRM ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE GUIDANCE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF QSPES AND PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE GUIDANCE ALSO

CHANGES THE APPROACH FOR DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE FROM A QUANTITATIVE RISK AND

REWARDS-BASED MODEL TO A QUALITATIVE MODEL, BASED ON CONTROL AND ECONOMICS. THE GUIDANCE BECAME

EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2009, INCLUDING ALL INTERIM

PERIODS WITHIN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD. THE FIRM ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE FOR VIES ON

JANUARY 1, 2010, WHICH REQUIRED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS,

BANK-ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS, AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. AT ADOPTION, THE FIRM ADDED APPROXIMATELY $88 BILLION OF U.S. GAAP ASSETS,

AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB FINALIZED AN AMENDMENT THAT DEFERS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW

CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT

FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS INCLUDED IN THE

DEFERRAL, THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY OTHER EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE

WHETHER SUCH FUNDS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED; AS SUCH, THESE FUNDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE

DISCLOSURE OF THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE NEW GUIDANCE FOR VIES.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS

PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND

EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE

FRAMEWORK IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE COSO CRITERIA.

BASED UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, JPMORGAN

CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA.

ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

AND ON THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING

AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS

FOR OUR OPINIONS.

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

141

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

 BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.), WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM

IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL

TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 34 ON PAGES 237239 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES

PRESCRIBED BY BANK REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IS OWNERSHIP

OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ENTITY. HOWEVER, A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ALSO MAY BE DEEMED TO EXIST WITH

RESPECT TO ENTITIES, SUCH AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT

INVOLVE CONTROLLING VOTING INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY BE

ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE

INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS

OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE)

FRAMEWORK AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK. THE APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON

THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY. THE QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE

WHEN AN ENTITY TRANSFERS (SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE MEETING CERTAIN DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE

CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED AT

THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT EXERCISE

CONTROL OVER THE ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. ENTITIES MEETING THESE

CRITERIA ARE NOT

CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL

ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE

OR TO CAUSE THE ENTITY TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA. THE FIRM PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE QSPE

MODEL FOR SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, AND CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE

AND STUDENT LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 198205 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN AN SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA, CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO THE VIE

FRAMEWORK. A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT: (1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO PERMIT

THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

PARTIES; (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE

ENTITYS OPERATIONS; AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE

ENTITYS LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE ENTITYS RETURNS.

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E., A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE

VIE IF THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF

THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, THE FIRM THOROUGHLY EVALUATES THE VIES DESIGN, CAPITAL

STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. WHEN THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS,

WHICH COMPUTES AND ALLOCATES EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS TO VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE

ALLOCATION OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES

OF EACH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE. THE FIRM RECONSIDERS WHETHER IT IS

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 206214 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ALL RETAINED INTERESTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND NONCONSOLIDATED

VIES ARE REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS ARE EITHER ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR AT FAIR VALUE IF ELECTED UNDER FAIR VALUE OPTION. THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

GENERALLY, FIRM-SPONSORED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ARE CONSIDERED VOTING ENTITIES AS THE FUNDS DO NOT

MEET THE CONDITIONS TO BE VIES. IN INSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING

MEMBER OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR

MEMBERS HAVE THE SUBSTANTIVE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER

WITHOUT CAUSE (I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS), BASED ON A SIMPLE UNAFFILIATED MAJORITY VOTE, OR HAVE

SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. IN

LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUTS OR

PARTICIPATING RIGHT, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE FUNDS.

142

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS,

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF

THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S.

REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. GAINS AND

LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

ACQUISITION OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

(WASHINGTON MUTUAL) FROM THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) FOR

$1.9 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION EXPANDED JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER BRANCH NETWORK INTO SEVERAL

STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, IDAHO, NEVADA AND OREGON AND CREATED THE

THIRD LARGEST BRANCH NETWORK IN THE U.S. THE ACQUISITION ALSO EXTENDS THE REACH OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS BANKING, COMMERCIAL BANKING, CREDIT CARD, CONSUMER LENDING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT

BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH

REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BE INITIALLY REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

IN 2008, THE $1.9 BILLION PURCHASE PRICE WAS PRELIMINARILY ALLOCATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, THAT WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THIS

ACQUISITION, NONCURRENT NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT WERE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE, SUCH AS THE PREMISES AND

EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE WRITTEN DOWN

AGAINST THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER WRITING DOWN THE

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE FINAL TOTAL EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS $2.0

BILLION.

MAY 30, 2008, THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS ACQUIRED FROM EACH

OTHER IN THE SHARE EXCHANGE TRANSACTION WERE CANCELLED. FROM APRIL 8, 2008, THROUGH MAY 30, 2008,

FROM THE FRBNY, AND A $1.15 BILLION SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE NOTE

IS SUBORDINATED TO THE FRBNY LOAN AND WILL BEAR THE FIRST $1.15 BILLION OF ANY LOSSES OF THE

PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF THE FRBNY LOAN, THE JPMORGAN

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

THE FIRM HAS PERFORMED AN EVALUATION OF EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2009,

AND THROUGH FEBRUARY 24, 2010 (THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). THERE HAVE BEEN NO

MATERIAL SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING SUCH PERIOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE IN THIS

ANNUAL REPORT, OR WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS

OF OR FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

NOTE 3

 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF

SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE THAT ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE, AS INPUTS, MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY

SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES,

EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION,

MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENT. VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY,

THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS. VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (CVA) ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS

NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. MARKET

PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO AN AA CREDIT RATING WHEREBY ALL COUNTERPARTIES

ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. THEREFORE, AN ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE ADJUSTMENT

ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

EACH COUNTERPARTY, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF OFFSET.



DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM

IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE

ADJUSTMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH CVA AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED

THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP MARKET.



LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A

RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE)

MARKETS OR TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS

(LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT TAKEN FOR POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY). THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION

BASED ON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT TRADES AND

MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM

MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE

THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL

QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

COSTS TO EXIT LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE SIZE

OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A

POSITION DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL.



UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS UNOBSERVABLE

PARAMETERS  THAT IS,

PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THESE

POSITIONS ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS WHERE

PARAMETERS SUCH AS CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE

148

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNOBSERVABLE. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO MITIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR AND REVISION IN THE

ESTIMATE OF THE MARKET PRICE PROVIDED BY THE MODEL.

THE FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAIR VALUATIONS ARE

APPROPRIATE. AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES

THEM FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS WITHIN THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW

PROCESS. A PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION, ENSURES OBSERVABLE

MARKET PRICES AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED FOR VALUATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE

PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN

INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING IS PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES

DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS,

AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES

THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT; AND DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED GAINS AND LOSSES,

WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE

INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, ARE BASED ON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE APPLIED

CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO

CONFIRM THAT THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE OR LESS

TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. DURING 2009, NO CHANGES WERE

MADE TO THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS THAT HAD, OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY

NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, WHILE

THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING

DATE.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER U.S. GAAP FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.



LEVEL 2  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY,

EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



LEVEL 3  ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT

TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL

OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM TO MEASURE INSTRUMENTS

AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

ASSETS

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES BORROWED

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS, CASH FLOWS

ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES OF THE RESALE AGREEMENT AND ARE

THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. AS THE INPUTS INTO

THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON READILY OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, SUCH RESALE AGREEMENTS

ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. THE FAIR VALUE OF

SUCH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF FAIR VALUE

OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP ON PAGES

163164 OF THIS NOTE. LOANS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING AND NONRECURRING BASIS ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPLICABLE TABLES

THAT FOLLOW.

WHOLESALE

THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR MOST LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN THE FIRMS

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE DIRECT SECONDARY MARKET INFORMATION,

INCLUDING PRICING OF ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, BROKER QUOTATIONS OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, IS AVAILABLE (PRINCIPALLY FOR LOANS IN THE FIRMS SECONDARY TRADING

PORTFOLIO), SUCH INFORMATION IS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE

PORTFOLIO, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) MODEL. IN ADDITION TO THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CUSTOMER RATE AND CONTRACTUAL FEES),

KEY INPUTS TO

THE MODEL INCLUDE INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, AND CREDIT SPREADS. THE CREDIT SPREAD INPUT IS

DERIVED FROM THE COST OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS) AND, AS A RESULT, ALSO INCORPORATES THE

EFFECTS OF SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY. AS MANY OF THE FIRMS CLIENTS DO NOT HAVE BONDS TRADED WITH

SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS TO HAVE OBSERVABLE CDS SPREADS, THE FIRM PRINCIPALLY

DEVELOPS BENCHMARK CREDIT CURVES BY INDUSTRY AND CREDIT RATING TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. ADDITIONAL

ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, ON WHICH THE COST OF

CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS AS WELL AS LOAN EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF

AN UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED ON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO

BECOME OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO AN OBLIGOR DEFAULT) ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE VALUATION PROCESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, SEE THE

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION

OF THIS NOTE ON PAGES 161162.

THE FIRMS LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

CONSUMER

THE ONLY PRODUCTS IN THE FIRMS CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO WITH A MEANINGFUL LEVEL OF SECONDARY MARKET

ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ARE CERTAIN CONFORMING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THESE

LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. THEY ARE PREDOMINANTLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY BASED ON THE

LEVEL OF MARKET LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION ON PAGES

161162 OF THIS NOTE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS OTHER CONSUMER LOANS (EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES) IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING THE LOAN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AT A

MARKET OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE. PORTFOLIO-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT A MARKET

PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE (E.G., EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES,

ESTIMATED PREPAYMENTS, SERVICING COSTS AND MARKET LIQUIDITY) ARE EITHER MODELED INTO THE CASH FLOW

PROJECTIONS OR INCORPORATED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE

OFFERED IN THE MARKET, DISCOUNT RATES ARE DERIVED FROM MARKET-OBSERVABLE PRIMARY ORIGINATION

SPREADS. WHERE PRIMARY ORIGINATION SPREADS ARE NOT AVAILABLE (I.E., SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, SUBPRIME

HOME EQUITY AND OPTION ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES (OPTION ARMS), THE VALUATION IS BASED ON THE

FIRMS ESTIMATE OF A MARKET PARTICIPANTS REQUIRED RETURN ON EQUITY FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS (I.E., A

HYPOTHETICAL ORIGINATION SPREAD). ESTIMATED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES CONSIDER EXPECTED AND CURRENT

DEFAULT RATES FOR EXISTING PORTFOLIOS, COLLATERAL PRICES (WHERE APPLICABLE) AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT (E.G., UNEMPLOYMENT RATES).

THE FAIR VALUE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGY. KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: PROJECTED INTEREST INCOME AND LATE FEE REVENUE,

FUNDING, SERVICING, CREDIT COSTS, AND LOAN PAYMENT RATES. THE PROJECTED LOAN PAYMENT RATES ARE USED

TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE CREDIT CARD LOAN RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED

USING A RISK-APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DERIVED FROM THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF A

MARKET PARTICIPANTS EXPECTED RETURN ON CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. AS THE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

HAVE A SHORT-TERM LIFE, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS CONSIDERED TO BE A

REASONABLE PROXY FOR THE CREDIT COST COMPONENT.

LOANS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE ARE NOT CLASSIFIED

WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

SECURITIES

WHERE QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHLY LIQUID

GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS SUCH AS

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE (COLLECTIVELY, U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES), PASS-THROUGH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS), AND EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITIES (E.G.,

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS).

IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THE FIRM MAY ESTIMATE THE

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G.,

INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO USE PRICING MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY;

HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACTIVITY OR LESS TRANSPARENCY AROUND INPUTS TO THE

VALUATION, SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) AND

HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE MAY REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES. FOR CASH COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

(CDOS), EXTERNAL PRICE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, CASH CDOS ARE VALUED USING

MARKET-STANDARD MODELS, SUCH AS INTEX, TO MODEL THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL COMPOSITION AND CASH FLOW

STRUCTURE OF EACH DEAL; KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE MARKET SPREAD DATA FOR EACH CREDIT RATING,

COLLATERAL TYPE AND OTHER RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL FEATURES. ABS ARE VALUED BASED ON EXTERNAL PRICES OR

MARKET SPREAD DATA, USING CURRENT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS ON PREPAYMENTS AND DEFAULTS. FOR THOSE ABS

WHERE THE EXTERNAL PRICE DATA IS NOT OBSERVABLE OR THE LIMITED AVAILABLE DATA IS OPAQUE, THE

COLLATERAL PERFORMANCE IS MONITORED AND THE VALUE OF THE SECURITY IS ASSESSED. TO BENCHMARK ITS

VALUATIONS, THE FIRM LOOKS TO TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS AND UTILIZES INDEPENDENT PRICES

PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND RELEVANT MARKET INDICES, SUCH AS THE ABX INDEX,

AS APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS

DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS ESTIMATES. THE MAJORITY OF

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES AND ABS ARE CURRENTLY

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF

MORTGAGE SECURITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE SECTION OF THIS NOTE ON PAGES 161162.

COMMODITIES

COMMODITIES INVENTORY ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITIES

INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICING AND DATA DERIVED FROM THE MARKETS ON WHICH THE

UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL

1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

150

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM ALSO HAS POSITIONS IN COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES THAT CAN BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. THE PRICING INPUTS TO THESE DERIVATIVES INCLUDE FORWARD

CURVES OF UNDERLYING COMMODITIES, BASIS CURVES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY OTHER

MODEL PARAMETERS. THE VALUATION OF THESE DERIVATIVES IS BASED ON CALIBRATING TO MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS TO INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION FROM SOURCES SUCH AS BROKERS AND DEALER

CONSENSUS PRICING SERVICES. WHERE INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THEY ARE BENCHMARKED TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA BASED ON HISTORIC AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS, THEN ADJUSTED FOR UNCERTAINTY WHERE

APPROPRIATE. THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

HOWEVER, FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE; THUS,

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT

IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES. DEPENDING ON THE TYPES AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF DERIVATIVES, FAIR VALUE

CAN BE MODELED USING A SERIES OF TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL,

SIMULATION MODELS OR A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS MODELS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. WHERE

DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR SOME TIME, THE FIRM USES MODELS THAT ARE WIDELY

ACCEPTED IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THESE MODELS REFLECT THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE

DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES,

VOLATILITY, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. FURTHER, MANY OF THESE MODELS DO NOT

CONTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVITY, AS THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN THE MODELS DO NOT REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, AND INPUTS TO THE MODELS ARE READILY OBSERVABLE FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED MARKETS,

AS IS THE CASE FOR PLAIN VANILLA INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTION CONTRACTS AND CDS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND

THAT ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY, HAVE TRADE ACTIVITY THAT IS ONE WAY, AND/OR ARE TRADED IN

LESS-DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 3

DERIVATIVES INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, CDS REFERENCED TO CERTAIN MBS, CERTAIN TYPES OF CDO TRANSACTIONS,

OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF SINGLE-NAME STOCKS, AND CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

OTHER COMPLEX PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYING

PARAMETERS, ALSO FALL WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. SUCH INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE COMPLEX

CREDIT DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ILLIQUID AND NON-STANDARD IN NATURE, INCLUDING CDOS AND

CDO-SQUARED. A CDO IS A DEBT INSTRUMENT COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

CDS, BONDS AND LOANS OF DIFFERENT MATURITIES AND CREDIT QUALITIES. THE REPACKAGING OF SUCH

SECURITIES AND LOANS WITHIN A CDO RESULTS IN THE CREATION OF TRANCHES, WHICH ARE INSTRUMENTS WITH

DIFFERENT RISK PROFILES. IN A CDO-SQUARED TRANSACTION, THE INSTRUMENT IS A CDO WHERE THE UNDERLYING

DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO

CDOS. FOR MOST CDO AND CDO-SQUARED TRANSACTIONS, WHILE INPUTS SUCH AS CDS

SPREADS AND RECOVERY RATES MAY BE OBSERVABLE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING DEBT

INSTRUMENTS IS UNOBSERVABLE. THE CORRELATION LEVELS ARE NOT ONLY MODELED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS BUT

ARE ALSO CALIBRATED AT A TRANSACTION LEVEL TO LIQUID BENCHMARK TRANCHES. FOR ALL COMPLEX CREDIT

DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS, ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WHERE AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO REGULARLY RECALIBRATE ALL

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS.

CORRELATION SENSITIVITY IS ALSO MATERIAL TO THE OVERALL VALUATION OF OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF

SINGLE-NAME STOCKS; THE VALUATION OF THESE BASKETS IS TYPICALLY NOT OBSERVABLE DUE TO THEIR

NON-STANDARDIZED STRUCTURING. CORRELATION FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS THESE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED BASED

ON AN OBSERVABLE BASKET OF STOCKS AND THEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

UNDERLYING EQUITIES.

FOR CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, WHILE MOST OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE VALUATION CAN BE

OBSERVED IN ACTIVE MARKETS (E.G. INTEREST RATES AND VOLATILITY), THE CALLABLE OPTION TRANSACTION

FLOW IS ESSENTIALLY ONE-WAY, AND AS SUCH, PRICE OBSERVABILITY IS LIMITED. AS PRICING INFORMATION IS

LIMITED, ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE UNDERLYING MARKETS (E.G., THE INTEREST RATE

MARKETS) INCLUDING THE RANGE AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE APPLICABLE INPUTS. IN ADDITION, THE

MODELS USED ARE CALIBRATED, AS RELEVANT, TO LIQUID BENCHMARKS, AND VALUATION IS TESTED AGAINST

MONTHLY INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO

NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING DCF MODELS.



FOR MSRS, THE FIRM USES AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION MODEL IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO PROJECT MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST

RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE MSRS. THE OAS MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING

FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, COSTS

TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE

UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET. DUE TO THE

NATURE OF THE VALUATION INPUTS, MSRS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.



FOR CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE FOR

THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS BY CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING

MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES,

SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE

RISKS INVOLVED. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS,

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND SUCH INTERESTS ARE THEREFORE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR

THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE VALUATION OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE HELD PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF BUSINESS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, THE INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND

THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. AS SUCH, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED INITIALLY BASED

ON COST. EACH QUARTER, VALUATIONS ARE REVIEWED UTILIZING AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT MARKET DATA TO

DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. SUCH MARKET DATA PRIMARILY

INCLUDE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRADING MULTIPLES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES CONSIDERED COMPARABLE TO THE

PRIVATE COMPANIES BEING VALUED AND THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO COMPANY,

INCLUDING ITS HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED NET INCOME AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA). VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUES, THE

LACK OF LIQUIDITY INHERENT IN A NONPUBLIC INVESTMENT AND THE FACT THAT COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES

ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO THE COMPANIES BEING VALUED. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS ARE

REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCING AND SALES TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD

PARTIES, FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR INVESTMENT, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 OF

THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLICLY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED

THROUGH THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATELY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS. PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS

IN LIQUID MARKETS ARE MARKED TO MARKET AT THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUE LESS ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGULATORY

OR CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS. DISCOUNTS FOR RESTRICTIONS ARE QUANTIFIED BY ANALYZING THE

LENGTH OF THE RESTRICTION PERIOD AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE EQUITY SECURITY. PUBLICLY HELD

INVESTMENTS ARE LARGELY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

OTHER FUND INVESTMENTS

THE FIRM HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL/COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS

AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS. WHERE THE FUNDS PRODUCE A DAILY NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) THAT IS VALIDATED BY

A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY (PURCHASES AND

SALES AT NAV), THE NAV IS USED TO VALUE

THE FUND INVESTMENT AND IT IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NAV ARE REQUIRED, FOR

EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO INTERESTS IN FUNDS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTION (SUCH AS LOCK-UP

PERIODS OR WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS) AND/OR OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY FOR THE FUND INVESTMENT IS LIMITED,

INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LIABILITIES

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS)

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING

THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS,

THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO, OR IN EXCESS OF,

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT, OR AN IMMATERIAL

ADJUSTMENT, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM (I.E., DVA) RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS. AS

THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FAIR VALUE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) IS

ESTIMATED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS HELD BY THE VIES. THE VALUATION OF

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM, AS

THE HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. WHERE THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICING INFORMATION, THE

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

INCLUDED WITHIN DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT ARE STRUCTURED NOTES ISSUED BY

THE FIRM THAT ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE

OF STRUCTURED NOTES, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES AND

ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITIES. IN ADDITION,

THE VALUATION OF STRUCTURED NOTES INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM

(I.E., THE DVA). WHERE THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES, THE STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THE STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

(A)

INCLUDES TOTAL U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS OF $195.8 BILLION

AND $182.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE PREDOMINANTLY

MORTGAGE-RELATED.

(B)

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MBS, SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURE

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION OF THIS NOTE ON PAGES 161162.

(C)

INCLUDED WITHIN TRADING LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, ARE $15.7 BILLION

AND $12.1 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES AND $2.7 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION OF

COMMERCIAL FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL LOANS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURE

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION OF THIS NOTE ON PAGES 161162.

(D)

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

(E)

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO NET DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND

DERIVATIVE PAYABLES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PAID WHEN A LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES

NOT REDUCE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BALANCES FOR THIS NETTING

ADJUSTMENT, EITHER WITHIN OR ACROSS THE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS SUCH NETTING IS

NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY. THEREFORE, THE BALANCES REPORTED IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TABLE ARE

GROSS OF ANY COUNTERPARTY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH BALANCES,

THE REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLE BALANCES WOULD BE

$16.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

(F)

PRIVATE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF

BUSINESS. THE COST BASIS OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS $8.8 BILLION AND $8.3

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

(G)

INCLUDES ASSETS WITHIN ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE AND OTHER ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008.

(H)

BALANCES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS VALUED AT NAV AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OF $16.8 BILLION, OF WHICH

$9.0 BILLION IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1, $3.2 BILLION IN LEVEL 2 AND $4.6 BILLION IN LEVEL 3.

(I)

INCLUDES ASSETS FOR WHICH THE FIRM SERVES AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN TWO PARTIES AND DOES NOT

BEAR MARKET RISK. THE ASSETS ARE PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTED WITHIN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A ROLLFORWARD OF THE ACTIVITY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY

THE FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND

2007 (INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE). LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN

ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT

ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN

THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO, THE FIRM RISK MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1

OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY; AS THESE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK

MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES DO NOT

REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO SUCH LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS.

LEVEL 3 ANALYSIS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS) WERE 6% OF TOTAL

FIRM ASSETS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. LEVEL 3 ASSETS WERE $130.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, REFLECTING A DECREASE OF $7.3 BILLION IN 2009, DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.



A NET DECREASE OF $6.3 BILLION IN GROSS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY THE

TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS. OFFSETTING A PORTION OF THE DECREASE WERE NET TRANSFERS INTO

LEVEL 3 DURING THE YEAR, MOST NOTABLY A TRANSFER INTO LEVEL 3 OF $41.3 BILLION OF STRUCTURED

CREDIT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, AND A TRANSFER OUT OF LEVEL 3 OF $17.7 BILLION OF SINGLE-NAME

CDS ON ABS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED INTO LEVEL 3 DURING THE YEAR WAS

$22.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED CREDIT DERIVATIVE PAYABLES

WITH A SIMILAR UNDERLYING RISK PROFILE TO THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED RECEIVABLES, THAT ARE ALSO

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3, WAS $12.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THESE DERIVATIVES PAYABLES

OFFSET THE RECEIVABLES, AS THEY ARE MODELED AND VALUED THE SAME WAY WITH THE SAME PARAMETERS

AND INPUTS AS THE ASSETS.



A NET DECREASE OF $3.5 BILLION IN LOANS, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY SALES OF LEVERAGED LOANS

AND TRANSFERS OF SIMILAR LOANS TO LEVEL 2, DUE TO INCREASED PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR SUCH

ASSETS. LEVERAGED LOANS ARE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDED IN THE NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE ASSETS.



A NET DECREASE OF $6.3 BILLION IN TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY

IN LOANS AND RESIDENTIAL- AND COMMERCIAL-MBS, PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY SALES AND MARKDOWNS, AND

BY SALES AND UNWINDS OF STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS WITH HEDGE FUNDS. THE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A TRANSFER FROM LEVEL 2 TO LEVEL 3 OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES REFLECTING LOWER

LIQUIDITY AND LESS PRICING OBSERVABILITY, AND ALSO INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER ABS.



A NET INCREASE OF $6.1 BILLION IN MSRS, DUE TO INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET,

RELATED PRIMARILY TO MARKET INTEREST RATE AND OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE PREPAYMENTS, AS WELL AS SALES IN RFS OF ORIGINATED LOANS FOR WHICH SERVICING RIGHTS

WERE RETAINED. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY SERVICING PORTFOLIO RUNOFF.



A NET INCREASE OF $1.9 BILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO

INCREASES IN SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS FROM THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES.

GAINS AND LOSSES

GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN THE TABLES FOR 2009 AND 2008 INCLUDED.

2009



$11.4 BILLION OF NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT

SPREADS.



NET LOSSES ON TRADINGDEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF $671 MILLION, CONSISTING OF $2.1

BILLION OF LOSSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL LOANS AND MBS, PRINCIPALLY

DRIVEN BY MARKDOWNS AND SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS OF $1.4 BILLION, REFLECTING INCREASES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER ABS. (FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES, INCLUSIVE OF RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED

EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE DISCUSSION BELOW.)



$5.8 BILLION OF GAINS ON MSRS.



$1.4 BILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO STRUCTURED NOTE LIABILITIES, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO

VOLATILITY IN THE EQUITY MARKETS.

2008



LOSSES ON TRADING-DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.8 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY

FROM MORTGAGE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES.



LOSSES OF $6.9 BILLION ON MSRS.



LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION ON LEVERAGED LOANS.



NET GAINS OF $4.6 BILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CHANGES IN CREDIT

SPREADS AND RATE CURVES.



GAINS OF $4.5 BILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED NOTES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

VOLATILITY IN THE FIXED INCOME, COMMODITIES AND EQUITY MARKETS.



PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES OF $638 MILLION.

EXCLUDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, ARE CERTAIN MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS

THAT ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED IN TRADING ASSETS, SUCH AS: (I) U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCY SECURITIES THAT ARE LIQUID AND OF HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF $41.7 BILLION AND $58.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; (II) CONFORMING MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE

INTENT TO SELL TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $11.1 BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND

(III) REVERSE MORTGAGES OF $4.5 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR WHICH

THE PRINCIPAL RISK IS MORTALITY RISK. ALSO EXCLUDED ARE MSRS, WHICH ARE REPORTED IN NOTE 17 ON

PAGES 214217 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(B)

EXCLUDED CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHICH ARE COLLATERALIZED BY

MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, OF $4.1 BILLION AND $5.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE, AS THEY ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS OF ACCOUNTING. FOR CERTAIN FINANCINGS DEEMED TO BE IMPAIRED,

IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. OF THESE

FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, $136 MILLION AND $1.2 BILLION WERE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

(C)

TOTAL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE EXPOSURES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, INCLUDE: (I) SECURITIES

OF $3.4 BILLION AND $4.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; (II) LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE OR THE LOWER

OF COST OR FAIR VALUE OF $5.0 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND (III) FORWARD

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS INCLUDED IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF $358 MILLION AND $1.2 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

(D)

AMOUNTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF THE GROSS

EXPOSURES ARISING FROM CASH-BASED INSTRUMENTS. THE AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED ON A BOND- OR

LOAN-EQUIVALENT (NOTIONAL) BASIS. DERIVATIVES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE GROSS EXPOSURE, AS THEY

ARE PRINCIPALLY USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

(E)

NET GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDE ALL REVENUE RELATED TO THE POSITIONS (I.E., INTEREST INCOME,

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT

POSITIONS, AND INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LIABILITIES FUNDING THOSE POSITIONS).

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES

CLASSIFICATION AND VALUATION

 RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND MBS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR

LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS

FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. LEVEL 3 ASSETS INCLUDE NONAGENCY RESIDENTIAL WHOLE LOANS AND SUBORDINATED

NONAGENCY RESIDENTIAL MBS. PRODUCTS THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE RELIABLE PRICE TRANSPARENCY AS EVIDENCED

BY CONSISTENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS SENIOR NONAGENCY SECURITIES, AS WELL AS AGENCY

SECURITIES, ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2.

FOR THOSE PRODUCTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G.,

INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES.

WHEN RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY IS NOT OCCURRING OR IS LIMITED, THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED AS

FOLLOWS.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

 FAIR VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS ESTIMATED BY PROJECTING

THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNTING THOSE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET

LIQUIDITY. TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS (INCLUSIVE OF ASSUMPTIONS OF PREPAYMENT, DEFAULT

RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY), SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC AND OTHER

MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE BORROWERS FICO SCORE; THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL

SUPPORTING THE LOAN; AN ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THE LOAN; THE

LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE LOAN; AND MARKET-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS FOR HOME PRICE APPRECIATION OR

DEPRECIATION IN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHY OF THE BORROWER.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

 FAIR VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL MBS IS ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE

VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF THE SECURITIES HELD BY THE FIRM. THE VALUE

OF THE COLLATERAL POOL SUPPORTING THE SECURITIES IS ANALYZED USING THE SAME TECHNIQUES AND FACTORS

DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, ALBEIT IN A MORE AGGREGATED MANNER ACROSS THE POOL.

FOR EXAMPLE, AVERAGE FICO SCORES, AVERAGE DELINQUENCY RATES, AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITIES AND PREPAYMENT

RATES, AMONG OTHER METRICS, MAY BE EVALUATED. IN ADDITION, AS EACH SECURITIZATION VEHICLE

DISTRIBUTES CASH IN A MANNER OR ORDER THAT IS PREDETERMINED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE, THE

PRIORITY IN WHICH EACH PARTICULAR MBS IS ALLOCATED CASH FLOWS, AND THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT

THAT IS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THOSE CASH FLOWS, ARE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN

161

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DERIVING THE VALUE OF

RESIDENTIAL MBS. FINALLY, THE RISK PREMIUM THAT INVESTORS DEMAND FOR SECURITIZED PRODUCTS IN THE

CURRENT MARKET IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION. TO BENCHMARK ITS VALUATIONS, THE FIRM LOOKS TO

TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS AND UTILIZES INDEPENDENT PRICING PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY

VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND RELEVANT MARKET INDICES, SUCH AS THE ABX INDEX, AS APPLICABLE. WHILE

NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS FOR

THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS ESTIMATES.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES ARE LOANS TO COMPANIES BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. COMMERCIAL MBS ARE

SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. TYPICALLY, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES HAVE

LOCK-OUT PERIODS WHERE THE BORROWER IS RESTRICTED FROM PREPAYING THE LOAN FOR A SPECIFIED

TIMEFRAME, OR PERIODS WHERE THERE ARE DISINCENTIVES FOR THE BORROWER TO PREPAY THE LOAN DUE TO

PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. THESE FEATURES REDUCE PREPAYMENT RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES RELATIVE TO

THAT OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES.

CLASSIFICATION AND VALUATION

WHILE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND COMMERCIAL MBS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS, THE MAJORITY

OF THESE MORTGAGES, INCLUDING BOTH LOANS AND LOWER-RATED SECURITIES, ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED IN

LEVEL 3. LEVEL 2 ASSETS INCLUDE FIXED-RATE COMMERCIAL MBS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

 FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS ESTIMATED BY PROJECTING THE

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNTING THOSE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET

LIQUIDITY. TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC

AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE BORROWERS DEBT-TO-SERVICE COVERAGE

RATIO; THE TYPE OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (E.G., RETAIL, OFFICE, LODGING, MULTI-FAMILY, ETC.); AN

ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO; AND MARKET-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS FOR PROPERTY PRICE

APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION IN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

 WHEN RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY IS NOT PRESENT OR IS LIMITED,

THE VALUE OF COMMERCIAL MBS IS ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE SPECIFIC

ATTRIBUTES OF THE SECURITIES HELD BY THE FIRM. THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL POOL SUPPORTING THE

SECURITIES IS ANALYZED

USING THE SAME TECHNIQUES AND FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE VALUATION OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS, ALBEIT IN A MORE AGGREGATED MANNER ACROSS THE POOL. FOR EXAMPLE, AVERAGE DELINQUENCIES, LOAN

OR GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, AND AVERAGE DEBT-SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS, AMONG OTHER METRICS, MAY BE

EVALUATED. IN ADDITION, AS EACH SECURITIZATION VEHICLE DISTRIBUTES CASH IN A MANNER OR ORDER THAT

IS PREDETERMINED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE, THE PRIORITY IN WHICH EACH PARTICULAR MBS

SECURITY IS ALLOCATED CASH FLOWS, AND THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT THAT IS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT

THOSE CASH FLOWS, ARE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DERIVING THE VALUE OF COMMERCIAL MBS. FINALLY, THE RISK

PREMIUM THAT INVESTORS DEMAND FOR SECURITIZED PRODUCTS IN THE CURRENT MARKET IS FACTORED INTO THE

VALUATION. TO BENCHMARK ITS VALUATIONS, THE FIRM UTILIZES INDEPENDENT PRICING PROVIDED BY

THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, AND BROKER QUOTES, AS APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY

INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

FIRMS ESTIMATES.

BILLION AND $140.1 BILLION OF MBS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY USED AS

PART OF THE FIRMS CENTRALIZED RISK MANAGEMENT OF STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK (THE SENSITIVITY OF

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES). CHANGES IN THE FIRMS

STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE POSITION, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE OVERALL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, ARE

CONTINUALLY MONITORED, RESULTING IN PERIODIC REPOSITIONING OF SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. GIVEN THAT THIS PORTFOLIO IS

PRIMARILY USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS STRUCTURAL

INTEREST RATE RISK, NEARLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE EITHER BACKED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR

ARE RATED AAA.

CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INSTRUMENT, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RECORD A VALUATION

ADJUSTMENT TO ARRIVE AT AN EXIT PRICE UNDER U.S. GAAP. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRMS OWN CREDITWORTHINESS. THE

MARKETS VIEW OF THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY IS REFLECTED IN CREDIT SPREADS OBSERVED IN THE CDS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT TRANSITION

IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL ADOPTION OF FASB GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, THE FIRM

RECORDED THE FOLLOWING ON JANUARY 1, 2007.



A CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $287 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

RELEASE OF PROFIT PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS FASB GUIDANCE FOR CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS;



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $166 MILLION ($103 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO THE

INCORPORATION OF THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE; AND



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $464 MILLION ($288 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO VALUATIONS

OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE)

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE

METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN

THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE; OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR

VALUE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE

AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD

RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE

TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY

NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE: CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS; DEPOSITS WITH BANKS,

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WITH

SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE; COMMERCIAL PAPER;

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED

MATURITIES; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS (EXCLUDING ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS); ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE; AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF DEPOSIT

LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE

EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE; RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS

NOT ALLOWED.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, WERE LIABILITIES OF $1.3 BILLION AND $7.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM DOES NOT ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUE OF CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR

CANCEL THESE COMMITMENTS BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE

AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TRADING ASSETS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES THAT JPMORGAN CHASE

OWNS (LONG POSITIONS), CERTAIN LOANS FOR WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS AND HAS

ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. TRADING LIABILITIES INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT THE FIRM

HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (SHORT POSITIONS). THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE

INSTRUMENTS AT A FUTURE DATE TO COVER THE SHORT POSITIONS. INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING

LIABILITIES ARE THE REPORTED RECEIVABLES (UNREALIZED GAINS) AND PAYABLES (UNREALIZED LOSSES)

RELATED TO DERIVATIVES. TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION AND A SUMMARY OF TRADING ASSETS AND

TRADING LIABILITIES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 165167 AND



ELIMINATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF APPLYING CERTAIN ACCOUNTING MODELS (E.G., HEDGE ACCOUNTING OR

BIFURCATION ACCOUNTING FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS); AND



BETTER REFLECT THOSE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

ELECTIONS INCLUDE.



SECURITIES FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE AND/OR A MATURITY OF GREATER

THAN ONE YEAR.



LOANS PURCHASED OR ORIGINATED AS PART OF SECURITIZATION WAREHOUSING ACTIVITY, SUBJECT TO

BIFURCATION ACCOUNTING, OR MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

RESPECTIVELY. THESE TOTALS INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR STRUCTURED NOTES CLASSIFIED WITHIN DEPOSITS

AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, AS WELL AS LONG-TERM DEBT.

(B)

STRUCTURED NOTES ARE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE TAILORED TO MEET A

CLIENTS NEED FOR DERIVATIVE RISK IN FUNDED FORM. THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE IS THE PRIMARY

DRIVER OF RISK. THE 2008 GAIN INCLUDED IN OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RESULTS FROM A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES WHERE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE IS

PRINCIPALLY LINKED TO EITHER EQUITY INDICES OR COMMODITY PRICES, BOTH OF WHICH DECLINED

SHARPLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. ALTHOUGH THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRUCTURED

NOTES IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, THE GAINS REPORTED IN THIS TABLE DO NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE

ELECTION WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.



LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN VALUE

ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION

OF THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE

INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY INFORMATION, WHERE

AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.



LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE

DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD.



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL

BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A

RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC

CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

(B)

WHERE THE FIRM ISSUES PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED ZERO-COUPON OR DISCOUNT NOTES, THE BALANCE REFLECTED

NOTE 5

 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO MODIFY OR MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET

RISKS. COUNTERPARTIES TO A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT SEEK TO OBTAIN RISKS AND REWARDS SIMILAR TO THOSE

THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM PURCHASING OR SELLING A RELATED CASH INSTRUMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO

EXCHANGE THE FULL PURCHASE OR SALES PRICE UPFRONT. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR

CUSTOMERS AND ALSO USES DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE RISKS OF MARKET EXPOSURES. THE MAJORITY OF

THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES.

TRADING DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM TRANSACTS IN A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVES IN ITS TRADING PORTFOLIOS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS (BOTH DEALERS AND CLIENTS) AND TO GENERATE REVENUE THROUGH THIS TRADING ACTIVITY. THE

FIRM MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS (COLLECTIVELY, CLIENT DERIVATIVES), SEEKING

TO MITIGATE OR MODIFY INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISKS. THE FIRM

ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS FROM ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO OTHER DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS OR BY PURCHASING OR SELLING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET

THE EXPOSURE FROM CLIENT DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM ALSO SEEKS TO EARN A SPREAD BETWEEN THE

CLIENT

DERIVATIVES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, AND FROM THE REMAINING OPEN RISK POSITIONS.

RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM MANAGES ITS MARKET EXPOSURES USING VARIOUS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE AS

INTEREST RATES CHANGE. SIMILARLY, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASE OR DECREASE AS A RESULT OF

VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESETTING TO CURRENT MARKET RATES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE

REPAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENT ORIGINATION OR ISSUANCE OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT CURRENT

MARKET RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. THE FIRM GENERALLY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

COMMODITIES BASED FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF CERTAIN

INVENTORY, INCLUDING GOLD AND BASE METALS, IN THE FIRMS COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO. GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THE FORWARDS AND FUTURES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION OF

THE RELATED INVENTORY. ALSO IN THE COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND

FORWARDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING AND

LOAD-SERVING CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN THE ENTITY REFERENCED

IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO PAY AN OBLIGATION

WHEN DUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVES SECTION ON PAGES 173175 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE HANDS; IT IS USED SIMPLY AS A REFERENCE TO CALCULATE PAYMENTS.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE

CONTRACT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS. THE TABULAR DISCLOSURES ON PAGES

169175 OF THIS NOTE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF, AND REPORTING FOR,

DERIVATIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN

STRUCTURED NOTES, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 ON PAGES 148165 AND 165167, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES 

TYPICALLY INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD AND BASE METAL DERIVATIVES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN THE

FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO

PURCHASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, BECAUSE OF

THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES. FOR THE SAME REASON, THE FIRM DOES NOT

APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, OR

TO COMMODITY DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF TOLLING AND LOAD-SERVING CONTRACTS.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ADDITION, FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A

HEDGE, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY MUST BE DOCUMENTED. HEDGE DOCUMENTATION MUST

IDENTIFY THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY AND TYPE OF RISK TO BE HEDGED,

AND HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DERIVATIVE IS ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO

ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS

NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR-VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A

DERIVATIVE HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM MUST BE

168

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST QUARTERLY. ANY

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EXACTLY OFFSET THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED

RISK) MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATIONS: FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET

INVESTMENT HEDGES. JPMORGAN CHASE USES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM

DEBT, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES AND GOLD AND BASE METAL INVENTORY. FOR QUALIFYING FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE, AND IN THE VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM,

FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED,

THEN THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF

THE

HEDGED ITEM AND FOR INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT.

DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE

HEDGED ITEM  PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM

FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. FOR

QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF

THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (OCI) AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS

AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION

OF THE HEDGED ITEM 

PRIMARILY INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, NONINTEREST REVENUE AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE

INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (AOCI) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED

AFFECT EARNINGS. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS

NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL HEDGE FORECAST, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE VALUES

RECORDED IN AOCI ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENTS IN

CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR

QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN THE

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN AOCI.

CREDIT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS INTRODUCED BY EACH DERIVATIVE CONTRACT TYPE, DERIVATIVES

EXPOSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO CREDIT RISK  THE RISK THAT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO MEET

THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND THE COLLATERAL, IF ANY, HELD BY THE

FIRM PROVES TO BE OF INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO COVER THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION. IT IS THE POLICY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE TO ENTER INTO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS TO ACTIVELY

PURSUE THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE AMOUNT

OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS

AT THEN-CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

WHILE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK, DERIVATIVE PAYABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO

LIQUIDITY RISK, AS THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO POST CASH OR SECURITIES

COLLATERAL WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS THE MARK-TO-MARKET (MTM) MOVES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES FAVOR, OR

UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THE FIRMS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-NOTCH AND SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE &

CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PRIMARILY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $1.2

BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM. CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF

EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE IMPACT OF SINGLE-NOTCH AND SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADES TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, PRIMARILY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH TERMINATION TRIGGERS

WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE FIRM TO SETTLE TRADES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $260 MILLION AND $4.7 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE PAYABLES THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT

COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES TRIGGERED UPON A DOWNGRADE WAS $22.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS POSTED COLLATERAL OF $22.3 BILLION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

ADDITION TO THE COLLATERAL AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED AND POSTED LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL

IN THE AMOUNT OF $15.5 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ALSO RECEIVES AND DELIVERS COLLATERAL AT THE INITIATION

OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD

ARISE SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS OR CLIENTS FAVOR, RESPECTIVELY.

FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM AND ITS COUNTERPARTIES HOLD COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A

NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY FOR COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED, AND COLLATERAL THAT THE FIRM OR A

COUNTERPARTY HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED $16.9 BILLION AND DELIVERED $5.8 BILLION OF SUCH ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT NETTED AGAINST THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES IN THE TABLE ABOVE,

BECAUSE, AT AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY LEVEL, THE COLLATERAL EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD-PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE

PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT

DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS

THE PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY

EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY, A FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION OR A

RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION BUT HAS

THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT

EVENT.

THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND USES

THESE DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES. FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER IN THE

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS, THE FIRM ACTIVELY RISK MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY

PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE

NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. AS A SELLER OF PROTECTION, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN REFERENCE ENTITY MAY

BE OFFSET PARTIALLY, OR ENTIRELY, WITH A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE PROTECTION FROM ANOTHER COUNTERPARTY

ON THE SAME OR SIMILAR REFERENCE ENTITY. SECOND, THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OVERALL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT

LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AS WELL AS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES. IN ACCOMPLISHING THE ABOVE, THE FIRM

USES

DIFFERENT TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (SINGLE-NAME) OR

A BROAD-BASED INDEX, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW. THE

FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION ON BOTH SINGLE- NAME AND INDEX-REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS.

SINGLE-NAME CDS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE BOTH OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED

TO MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY, WHILE CDS INDEX ARE USED TO MANAGE CREDIT

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND

OTHER MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX IS COMPRISED OF A PORTFOLIO OF CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE

ENTITIES. NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE ESTABLISHED APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX MONTHS WITH A NEW

UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF THE

REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT

DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX. CDS CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF

REFERENCE NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR

EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST $1 MILLION OF REALIZED CREDIT LOSSES IN A $10

MILLION PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, UNDER THE

TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE ENTITY. THE

PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE

VALUE OF THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLING

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER DOES NOT

NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AMOUNTS DUE

UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES

A CREDIT LINKED NOTE (CLN) IS A FUNDED CREDIT DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CLN PURCHASES

CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCED ENTITY FROM THE NOTE INVESTOR. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR

PAYS THE ISSUER PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN RETURN, THE

ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR, BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE REFERENCED ENTITY.

THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS THE REFERENCE

ENTITY EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT. IN THAT EVENT, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY

THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS THE INVESTOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR

VALUE OF THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF

SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY TO THE CLN HAS RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CLNS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 206214 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES THE FIRM SOLD AND PURCHASED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. UPON A CREDIT

EVENT, THE FIRM AS SELLER OF PROTECTION WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE FULL

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF NET PROTECTION SOLD, AS THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE CONTRACTS

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME

OF SETTLEMENT. THE

FIRM MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH

IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES. AS SUCH, OTHER PURCHASED PROTECTION REFERENCED

IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, REFERENCE

POSITIONS; THESE INCLUDE INDICES, AND PORTFOLIO COVERAGE. THE FIRM DOES NOT USE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS

THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BECAUSE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS DO NOT TAKE

INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE

OBLIGATION, OR RELATED CASH INSTRUMENTS AND ECONOMIC HEDGES.

 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB)

PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF

PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE

YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE

FIRM ANNOUNCED CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE PAY CREDIT SCHEDULE AND AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION

RECOGNIZED UNDER THE U.S. PLAN EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2010. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON

FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

176

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS. ON JANUARY 15, 2009, AND AUGUST 28, 2009, THE

FIRM MADE DISCRETIONARY DEDUCTIBLE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN OF

$1.3 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2010 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, IF ANY, IS NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME. THE EXPECTED

AMOUNT OF 2010 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IS $171 MILLION OF WHICH

$148 MILLION IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS

RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS ON COMPENSATION

AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN. THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT,

EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2009, PAY CREDITS WOULD NO LONGER BE PROVIDED ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE

MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

IN THE AMOUNT OF $267 MILLION AND $273 MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND IN CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K) SAVINGS

PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE

401(K)

SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO

MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE

COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A CERTAIN

PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND LEGAL LIMITS.

EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A ONE-YEAR-OF-SERVICE

REQUIREMENT AND ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED IN THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN MADE. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL

ANNUAL

CASH COMPENSATION OF $250,000 OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. THE

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING

COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT, EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2009, FOR EMPLOYEES EARNING $50,000 OR MORE PER YEAR,

MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN WILL BE MADE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE FIRMS

MANAGEMENT, DEPENDING ON THE FIRMS EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM AMENDED THE

MATCHING CONTRIBUTION FEATURE TO PROVIDE THAT: (I) MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY, WILL BE

CALCULATED AND CREDITED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOLLOWING THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR; AND (II)

MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS WILL VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER MAY

1, 2009. THE FIRM ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER 2009 THAT, FOR 2009, IT WILL CONTRIBUTE THE FULL MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES EARNING LESS THAN $250,000 BASED ON THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, BUT NOT

TO EXCEED 5% OF THEIR ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (E.G., BASE PAY).

EFFECTIVE AUGUST 10, 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BECAME THE SPONSOR OF THE WAMU SAVINGS PLAN.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF

SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS.

THE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO

ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI)

PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES,

COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE

THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE

U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

GAINS AND LOSSES

FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF

NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE

YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS 10% OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION OR THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS, AS WELL AS PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY NINE YEARS. FOR OPEB PLANS, ANY EXCESS NET GAINS AND

LOSSES ALSO ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIVE YEARS;

HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FOUR YEARS.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES

ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED ON

HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE

SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL

EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE

SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED

EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR

RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO MIX OF EACH PLAN; AS A

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RESULT, IN 2009 THE FIRM GENERALLY

MAINTAINED THE SAME EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH

ASSET CLASS. THE RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K.

GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE RETURN ON AA-RATED

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS HAS BEEN TAKEN AS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON SUCH BONDS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES

AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED

FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN

WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE

REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED

AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS

REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS

BOND INDEX.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM DECREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET INTEREST

RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $31

MILLION FOR 2010. THE 2010

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT

7.5% AND 7.0%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION DECLINED FROM 8.5%

IN 2009 TO 7.75% IN 2010, DECLINING TO A RATE OF 5% IN 2014. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE INTEREST

CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION AND THE ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT 5.25% AND 4.0%,

RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD

CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS

WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION IN 2010 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

PLAN EXPENSE. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN

AN INCREASE IN 2010 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION

AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT

DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE 2010

NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION. A 25-BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD

RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2010 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND

AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $67 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE FIRMS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN A

WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITIES (INCLUDING U.S. LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALIZATION AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES), FIXED INCOME (E.G., CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS, INCLUDING U.S.

TREASURY INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES), REAL ESTATE, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (E.G., HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS). NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE ALSO INVESTED IN

WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRMS COLI

POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND PARTIALLY THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH

AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT

INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY

STOCK-INDEX FUNDS. IN ADDITION, THE PLANS HOLD INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE SPONSORED

OR MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.6 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION FOR U.S.

PLANS AND $474 MILLION AND $354 MILLION FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO

OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE PLANS NEEDS AND GOALS USING A GLOBAL

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER.

PERIODICALLY THE FIRM PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE

ANALYSIS ON THE PLANS ASSET ALLOCATIONS,

INCORPORATING PROJECTED ASSET AND LIABILITY DATA, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SHORT-AND LONG-TERM IMPACT

OF THE PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION ON CUMULATIVE PENSION EXPENSE, ECONOMIC COST, PRESENT VALUE OF

CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDED STATUS. CURRENTLY, APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE: U.S. EQUITY 15 

35%, INTERNATIONAL EQUITY 15  25%, DEBT SECURITIES 10 

30%, HEDGE FUNDS 10  30%, REAL ESTATE 5 

20%, AND PRIVATE EQUITY 5  20%. THE PLAN DOES NOT MANAGE TO A SPECIFIC TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION,

BUT SEEKS TO SHIFT ASSET CLASS ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THESE STATED RANGES. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A

COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. ASSET ALLOCATION DECISIONS ALSO

INCORPORATE THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND ANTICIPATED IMPLICATIONS OF THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON

THE PLANS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND MANAGERS. MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY, WHICH

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS FOR CASH IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN THE ASSET

ALLOCATION PROCESS. THE FIRM REGULARLY REVIEWS THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ALL FACTORS THAT

CONTINUOUSLY IMPACT PORTFOLIO CHANGES TO ENSURE THE PLAN STAYS WITHIN THESE ASSET ALLOCATION

RANGES. THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

THE PLANS INVESTMENTS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH AS

INTEREST RATE, MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. THE PLANS EXPOSURE TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK IS

MITIGATED BY THE BROAD DIVERSIFICATION OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE INVESTMENTS IN EACH OF THE COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS AND REGISTERED

INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE FURTHER DIVERSIFIED INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS SUBJECT TO AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK RELATIVE TO THE PLANS LIABILITIES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY IN

RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PLANS LIABILITY PROFILES, THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS LARGEST

ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE TO DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROPRIATE DURATIONS. OTHER ASSETS ARE THEN INVESTED

FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, MAINLY EQUITY SECURITIES, TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT GROWTH. THE

PLANS ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE FAIR VALUES OF TOTAL PLAN

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE PLANS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

THE FOLLOWING DETAILS THE INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION

OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148-165 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDES CURRENCY ON HAND, DEMAND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, AND ANY SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH (I.E.,

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS). DUE TO THE HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE OF

THESE ASSETS THEY ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

EQUITY SECURITIES

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR STOCK EXCHANGE ON

WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND VEHICLES VALUED BASED ON THE QUOTED NAV, AND THEY ARE

GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE

FUNDS. HEDGE FUNDS ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED NAV AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR EACH

INVESTMENT. CERTAIN OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTION (SUCH AS INITIAL

LOCK-UP PERIODS, WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS AND ILLIQUID ASSETS) AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. THE VALUATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND REAL ESTATE

FUNDS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, THE

INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS AND THEREFORE, THEY ARE

GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES

A LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR

EXCHANGE ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED. WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN

ACTIVE MARKET, THE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED

MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING

PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF SECURITIES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

SUCH SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE BOTH U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND NONAGENCY SECURITIES. U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND ARE THEREFORE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. NONAGENCY SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY AAA RATED

RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BASED SECURITIES VALUED USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED

TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS

GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES AND THE RELATIONSHIPS OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO

THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. SUCH SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT DERIVATIVE, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE USED BY THE PLANS TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

CAUSED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT, INTEREST RATE, AND EQUITY

RISKS. THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY ALSO BE USED IN LIEU OF INVESTING IN CASH INSTRUMENTS. THESE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE PRIMARILY VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR

BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

OTHER

OTHER CONSISTS OF EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFS), MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS, AND PARTICIPATING AND

NON-PARTICIPATING ANNUITY CONTRACTS (THE ANNUITY CONTRACTS). ETFS AND MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE

VALUED USING NAV. THOSE FUND INVESTMENTS WITH A DAILY NAV THAT ARE VALIDATED BY A SUFFICIENT LEVEL

OF OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY (PURCHASES AND SALES AT NAV) ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY. WHERE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NAV ARE REQUIRED, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR FUND INVESTMENTS SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTION (SUCH AS LOCK-UP PERIODS OR WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS), AND/OR OBSERVABLE

ACTIVITY FOR THE FUND INVESTMENT IS LIMITED, FUND INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY. ANNUITY CONTRACTS ARE VALUED AT THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

ASSETS HELD IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT EXCEEDS THE ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED GUARANTEED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION COVERED UNDER THE ANNUITY CONTRACTS. ANNUITY CONTRACTS LACK MARKET MECHANISMS FOR

TRANSFERRING EACH INDIVIDUAL POLICY AND GENERALLY INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TIMING OF SURRENDER;

THEREFORE, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

 EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN 2009, 2008, AND 2007, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2005 PLAN). THE 2005 PLAN, PLUS PRIOR FIRM

PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE

PLANS (COLLECTIVELY,LTI PLAN). THE 2005 PLAN BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 17, 2005, AND WAS AMENDED IN

MAY 2008. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED 2005 PLAN, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, 199 MILLION SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH MAY 2013. THE AMENDED 2005 PLAN IS THE ONLY ACTIVE

PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT UPON THEIR GRANT. RSUS ARE

GENERALLY GRANTED ANNUALLY AND GENERALLY VEST AT A RATE OF 50% AFTER TWO YEARS AND 50% AFTER THREE

YEARS AND CONVERT INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION, RSUS TYPICALLY

INCLUDE FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON

VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS BASED ON AGE OR

SERVICE-RELATED REQUIREMENTS. ALL OF THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE.

AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING AND, AS SUCH, ARE CONSIDERED

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 25 ON PAGE 224 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UNDER THE LTI PLAN, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN

EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE. THE FIRM

TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR, AND IT ALSO PERIODICALLY GRANTS

DISCRETIONARY STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF BOTH

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS. THE 2009, 2008 AND 2007 GRANTS OF SARS TO KEY EMPLOYEES VEST

RATABLY OVER 5 YEARS (I.E., 20% PER YEAR) AND DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY

PROVISIONS. THESE AWARDS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A

SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. GENERALLY, FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED, COMPENSATION EXPENSE

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE

TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING

PERIOD. FOR AWARDS WITH FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, THE FIRM ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF

AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE AS OF THE GRANT DATE  WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF

POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL-CAREER

ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEES FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING

DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRMS POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS IS TO

ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, THE FIRM

SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO 2 MILLION SARS.

THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY

AWARDED BY THE FIRM. THE SARS, WHICH HAVE A 10-YEAR TERM, WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE NO EARLIER THAN

JANUARY 22, 2013, AND HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $39.83. THE NUMBER OF SARS THAT WILL BECOME

EXERCISABLE (RANGING FROM NONE TO THE FULL 2 MILLION) AND THEIR EXERCISE DATE OR DATES MAY BE

DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE

CEO AND JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM RECOGNIZES THIS AWARD RATABLY OVER AN ASSUMED FIVE-YEAR SERVICE

PERIOD, SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD THROUGH THE

GRANT DATE. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $9 MILLION AND $1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR THIS AWARD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, 46 MILLION BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS,

PRINCIPALLY RSUS, CAPITAL APPRECIATION PLAN UNITS AND STOCK OPTIONS, WERE EXCHANGED FOR EQUIVALENT

JPMORGAN CHASE AWARDS USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.21753. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE EMPLOYEE

STOCK AWARDS WAS INCLUDED IN THE BEAR STEARNS PURCHASE PRICE, SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE AWARDS

WERE FULLY VESTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MERGER DATE UNDER PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDED FOR ACCELERATED

VESTING UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF BEAR STEARNS. HOWEVER, BEAR STEARNS VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS HAD NO IMPACT ON THE PURCHASE PRICE; SINCE THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

OUT OF THE MONEY AT THE MERGER DATE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS WAS EQUAL TO ZERO UPON THEIR

CONVERSION INTO JPMORGAN CHASE OPTIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO EXCHANGED 6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR

27 MILLION SHARES OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK HELD IN AN IRREVOCABLE GRANTOR TRUST (THE RSU

TRUST), USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.21753. THE RSU TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TO HOLD COMMON

STOCK UNDERLYING AWARDS GRANTED TO SELECTED EMPLOYEES AND KEY EXECUTIVES UNDER CERTAIN BEAR STEARNS

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. THE RSU TRUST WAS CONSOLIDATED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, AND THE SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST WERE RECORDED IN SHARES HELD IN

RSU TRUST, WHICH REDUCED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, SIMILAR TO THE TREATMENT FOR TREASURY STOCK. A

RELATED OBLIGATION TO ISSUE STOCK UNDER THESE EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS IS REPORTED IN CAPITAL SURPLUS.

THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST TO EMPLOYEES HAS NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS TOTAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE. SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST WERE

DISTRIBUTED IN 2008 AND 2009, WITH A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES IN THE RSU TRUST DISTRIBUTED THROUGH

DECEMBER 2009. THERE WERE 2 MILLION SHARES IN THE RSU TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE REMAINING

SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DISTRIBUTED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

OF $845 MILLION, $409 MILLION AND $500 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION (PRETAX) OF COMPENSATION COST

RELATED TO UNVESTED AWARDS HAD NOT YET BEEN CHARGED TO NET INCOME. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE

AMORTIZED INTO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.2 YEARS. THE FIRM DOES NOT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE

11  SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS, HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING SECURITIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 148-165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED PRIMARILY AS

AFS WHEN USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS TO MAKE

STRATEGIC LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS. AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE

REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS). THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES,

WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE FIRM HAS NOT

CLASSIFIED NEW PURCHASES OF SECURITIES AS HTM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB AMENDED THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI) MODEL FOR DEBT

SECURITIES. THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR EQUITY SECURITIES WAS NOT AFFECTED. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE,

OTTI LOSSES MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IF AN INVESTOR HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY,

OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INVESTOR WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY

BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. HOWEVER, EVEN IF AN INVESTOR DOES NOT EXPECT TO SELL A

DEBT SECURITY, IT MUST EVALUATE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED AND DETERMINE IF A CREDIT LOSS

EXISTS. IN THE EVENT OF A CREDIT LOSS, ONLY THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT

LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. AMOUNTS RELATING TO FACTORS OTHER THAN CREDIT LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN

OCI. THE GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE CALCULATION OF CREDIT LOSSES,

AS WELL AS FACTORS CONSIDERED IN REACHING A CONCLUSION THAT AN INVESTMENT IS NOT

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. JPMORGAN CHASE EARLY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE FOR THE

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2009. THE FIRM DID NOT RECORD A TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT FOR SECURITIES HELD

AT MARCH 31, 2009, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AS THE FIRM

INTENDED TO SELL THE SECURITIES FOR WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS.

AFS SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF THE FIRMS ONGOING ASSESSMENT

OF OTTI. WHEN THE FIRM INTENDS TO SELL AFS SECURITIES, IT RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO

THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL AFS EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION,

POTENTIAL OTTI IS CONSIDERED USING A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO

WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; ADVERSE CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE

INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A

SECURITY; PAYMENT STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY; CHANGES TO THE RATING OF THE SECURITY BY A RATING

AGENCY; THE VOLATILITY OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY AFTER

THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LIVES

OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL TO ASSESS WHETHER CREDIT LOSSES EXIST AND, WHERE APPLICABLE FOR

PURCHASED OR RETAINED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED ASSETS, TO DETERMINE IF ANY ADVERSE

CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS HAVE OCCURRED. THE FIRMS CASH FLOW ESTIMATES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTATIONS

OF RELEVANT MARKET AND ECONOMIC DATA AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD  INCLUDING, FOR

EXAMPLE, FOR SECURITIES ISSUED IN A SECURITIZATION, UNDERLYING LOAN-LEVEL DATA, AND STRUCTURAL

FEATURES OF THE SECURITIZATION, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, EXCESS SPREAD, OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OR

OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. THE FIRM COMPARES THE LOSSES PROJECTED FOR THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL (POOL LOSSES) AGAINST THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE

TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE POOL LOSSES, OR WHETHER A CREDIT

LOSS ON THE AFS DEBT SECURITY EXISTS. THE FIRM ALSO PERFORMS OTHER ANALYSES TO SUPPORT ITS CASH

FLOW PROJECTIONS, SUCH AS FIRST-LOSS ANALYSES OR STRESS SCENARIOS. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM

CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN THE FIRM

DOES NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS AN OTTI TO HAVE

OCCURRED WHEN THERE IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS TO BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

THAT ARE RATED BELOW AA AT ACQUISITION, OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE SETTLED

IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRM WOULD NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED INVESTMENT. FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE ABOVE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS INTENT AND ABILITY

TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN

MARKET VALUE, AND WHETHER EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT A REALIZABLE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN

THE CARRYING VALUE. THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF AFS EQUITY SECURITIES TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT RECOVER ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF ITS AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.

UNREALIZED LOSSES HAVE DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2008, DUE PRIMARILY TO OVERALL MARKET SPREAD

AND MARKET LIQUIDITY IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED PRICING ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITIES WITH A LOSS POSITION IN AOCI,

AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY OF

THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS. EXCEPT FOR THE SECURITIES REPORTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR WHICH CREDIT

INCOME, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED LOSS IN AOCI ARE NOT

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS PRIMARY SECURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED

IN ITS ESTIMATE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS MOST LIKELY TO BE COLLECTED FROM THESE

INVESTMENTS.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES ON MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES RELATED TO U.S.

AGENCIES WERE $608 MILLION, OF WHICH $5 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES DO NOT HAVE

ANY CREDIT LOSSES, GIVEN THE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  PRIME AND ALT-A NONAGENCY

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO PRIME AND ALT-A RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY PRIVATE ISSUERS WERE $807 MILLION, OF WHICH $780 MILLION

RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS.

OVERALL LOSSES HAVE DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2008, DUE TO INCREASED MARKET STABILIZATION,

RESULTING FROM INCREASED DEMAND FOR HIGHER-YIELDING ASSET CLASSES AND NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.

APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THESE POSITIONS (BY AMORTIZED COST) ARE CURRENTLY RATED AAA. THE

REMAINING TWO-THIRDS HAVE EXPERIENCED DOWNGRADES SINCE PURCHASE, AND APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE

POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY RATED BELOW INVESTMENT-GRADE. IN ANALYZING PRIME AND ALT-A RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES FOR POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES, THE FIRM UTILIZES A METHODOLOGY THAT

FOCUSES ON LOAN-LEVEL DETAIL TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE THEN APPLIED TO THE VARIOUS

TRANCHES OF ISSUED SECURITIES BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS OF THE

SECURITIZATION TRUST. THE LOAN-LEVEL ANALYSIS CONSIDERS PREPAYMENT, HOME PRICE, DEFAULT RATE AND

LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS. GIVEN THIS LEVEL OF GRANULARITY, THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION SUCH FACTORS AS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BORROWER,

LOAN TO VALUE RATIO, LOAN TYPE AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE UNDERLYING DEFAULT RATE ON THE POSITIONS WAS 19% AND THE RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOSS

SEVERITY WAS 51%. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED $138 MILLION OF OTTI LOSSES IN

EARNINGS IN 2009, RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DELINQUENCY RATES

ASSOCIATED TO SPECIFIC COLLATERAL TYPES AND ORIGINATION DATES. THE UNREALIZED LOSS OF $807 MILLION

ON THE REMAINING SECURITIES IS CONSIDERED TEMPORARY, BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT LEVELS FOR THOSE SECURITIES REMAIN SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS INVESTMENT.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  COMMERCIAL

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

WERE $63 MILLION, OF WHICH $29 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS

POSITION FOR LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE RATED

AAA, AA, A AND BBB AND POSSESS, ON AVERAGE, 29% SUBORDINATION (A FORM OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT

FOR THE BENEFIT OF SENIOR SECURITIES, EXPRESSED HERE AS THE PERCENTAGE OF POOL LOSSES THAT CAN

OCCUR BEFORE A SENIOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITY WILL INCUR ITS FIRST DOLLAR OF PRINCIPAL LOSS). IN

CONSIDERING WHETHER POTENTIAL CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES EXIST, THE FIRM CONDUCTED A SCENARIO ANALYSIS,

USING HIGH LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES OVER THE NEAR TERM, FOLLOWED BY LOWER LEVELS OVER THE

LONGER TERM. SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDED: (I) DEFAULT OF ALL LOANS MORE THAN 60 DAYS DELINQUENT;

(II) ADDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES FOR THE REMAINING PORTFOLIO FORECASTED TO BE UP TO 8% IN THE NEAR

TERM AND 2% IN THE LONGER TERM; AND (III) LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS RANGING FROM 45% IN THE NEAR

TERM TO 40% IN LATER YEARS.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES  CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES WERE $26 MILLION, WHICH RELATE TO SECURITIES THAT WERE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

FOR LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. ONE OF THE KEY METRICS THE FIRM REVIEWS FOR CREDIT CARDRELATED

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IS EACH TRUSTS EXCESS SPREAD, WHICH IS THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT RESULTING

FROM CASH THAT REMAINS EACH MONTH AFTER PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO INVESTORS FOR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

AND TO SERVICERS FOR SERVICING FEES, AND AFTER CREDIT LOSSES ARE ALLOCATED. THE AVERAGE EXCESS

SPREAD FOR THE ISSUING TRUSTS IN WHICH THE FIRM HOLDS INTERESTS RANGES FROM 3.8% TO 13.8% WITH A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF 6.9%.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES  COLLATERALIZED DEBT AND LOAN OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO COLLATERALIZED DEBT AND LOAN

OBLIGATIONS WERE $436 MILLION, OF WHICH $435 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT WERE IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. OVERALL LOSSES HAVE DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER

31, 2008, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF, LOWER DEFAULT FORECASTS AND

SPREAD TIGHTENING ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED

AAA AND AA AND HAVE AN AVERAGE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF 29%. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN CLOS IS

PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION, WHICH IS THE EXCESS OF THE PAR AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL

OVER THE PAR AMOUNT OF SECURITIES. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS CONSIDERED IN ANALYZING POTENTIAL CREDIT

LOSSES WERE UNDERLYING LOAN AND DEBT SECURITY DEFAULTS AND LOSS SEVERITY. BASED ON CURRENT DEFAULT

TRENDS, THE FIRM ASSUMED COLLATERAL DEFAULT RATES OF 5% FOR 2009 AND THEREAFTER. FURTHER, LOSS

SEVERITIES WERE ASSUMED TO BE 50% FOR LOANS AND 80% FOR DEBT SECURITIES. LOSSES ON COLLATERAL WERE

ESTIMATED TO OCCUR APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS AFTER DEFAULT.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 12  SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY

POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS, ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS FINANCING NEEDS, AND

SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

RESALE AGREEMENTS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THE SECURITIES WILL

BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. ON JANUARY 1, 2007, PURSUANT TO THE

ADOPTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, THE FIRM ELECTED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR CERTAIN RESALE AND

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IN 2008, THE FIRM ELECTED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR CERTAIN NEWLY

TRANSACTED SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION, SEE NOTES 4 AND 20 ON PAGES 165167 AND 219, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. THE SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED ARE

REPORTED WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES BORROWED; AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. GENERALLY, FOR AGREEMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE

RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES

THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB GUIDANCE FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, ALL

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE

REPORTED ON A NET BASIS. JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM

ITS COUNTERPARTIES, AND REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN NECESSARY.

TRANSACTIONS SIMILAR TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER THAN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE/(SALE) OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A FORWARD

OBLIGATION TO SELL/(PURCHASE) THE SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE/(SALE) OBLIGATION IS A

DERIVATIVE THAT IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR

RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE

MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES

BORROWED AND LENT ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE PLEDGES CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IT OWNS TO COLLATERALIZE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SECURITIES FINANCINGS. PLEDGED SECURITIES THAT CAN BE SOLD OR REPLEDGED BY THE

SECURED PARTY ARE IDENTIFIED AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED (PLEDGED TO VARIOUS PARTIES) ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM RECEIVED SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL THAT COULD BE REPLEDGED, DELIVERED

OR OTHERWISE USED WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $614.4 BILLION. THIS COLLATERAL WAS GENERALLY

OBTAINED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS AND CUSTOMER MARGIN LOANS. OF

THESE SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY $392.9 BILLION WERE REPLEDGED, DELIVERED OR OTHERWISE USED,

GENERALLY AS COLLATERAL UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS OR TO COVER

SHORT SALES.

NOTE 13  LOANS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN MAY DIFFER BASED ON WHETHER IT IS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED AND WHETHER

THE LOAN IS USED IN AN INVESTING OR TRADING STRATEGY. FOR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, THE

ACCOUNTING ALSO DIFFERS DEPENDING ON WHETHER A LOAN IS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

PURCHASED LOANS WITH EVIDENCE OF CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE THE ORIGINATION DATE AND FOR WHICH IT

IS PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE WILL NOT BE

COLLECTED ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED. THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK FOR LOANS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED INCOME,

UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS, AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, FOR LOANS HELD

FOR INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS);



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE,

FOR LOANS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE;



AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE, FOR LOANS

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS; OR



PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE,

WHICH INCLUDES ESTIMATED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES. ACCORDINGLY, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

RELATED TO THESE LOANS IS NOT RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. SEE NOTE 3 AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 148165 AND 165167 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

FOR LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, INTEREST INCOME IS

RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A BASIS APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE

TERM OF THE LOAN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. LOANS (OTHER THAN

CREDIT CARD LOANS, CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CONSIDERED

NONPERFORMING WHEN FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS

REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS

SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED

IN CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL,

CASH RECEIPTS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH LOANS (I.E., THE COST RECOVERY

METHOD). INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS

CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL.

LOANS MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THERE HAS BEEN

DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE TERMS OF THE

RESTRUCTURED LOANS.

WHOLESALE AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS (WHICH ARE RISK-RATED) ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED. THIS DETERMINATION INCLUDES

MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRMS CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE

WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN AND VALUATION OF THE BORROWERS EQUITY.

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN BUSINESS BANKING AND PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT

CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE

OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE

BORROWER), WHICH EVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE NO LATER THAN 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS, IF COLLATERALIZED, ARE

GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE.

IN ADDITION, ANY IMPAIRED LOAN THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT IS CHARGED-OFF TO AN

AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL. LOANS ARE IDENTIFIED AS

COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT WHEN MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT COLLATERAL IS THE SOLE SOURCE OF REPAYMENT.

A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER

ASSETS, AT THE LOWER OF THE RECORDED INVESTMENT

IN THE LOAN OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL

LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL, ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE

COLLATERAL, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

LOANS WITHIN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO

THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO. TRANSFERS TO HELD-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR

VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES AND LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE.

LOANS WITHIN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY

ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

196198 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONSUMER LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING.

LOANS WITH INSIGNIFICANT DELAYS OR INSIGNIFICANT SHORT FALLS IN THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS EXPECTED TO

BE COLLECTED ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED.

ALL IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES

196198 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS ARE DEEMED IMPAIRED UPON BEING

CONTRACTUALLY MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING. TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS TYPICALLY

RESULT FROM THE FIRMS LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND OCCUR WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS A CONCESSION

TO A BORROWER WHO IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE FIRMS ECONOMIC

LOSS AND TO AVOID FORECLOSURE OR REPOSSESSION OF COLLATERAL. ONCE RESTRUCTURED IN A TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURING, A LOAN IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED IMPAIRED UNTIL ITS MATURITY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

THE BORROWER PERFORMS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. ALTHOUGH SUCH A LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL

STATUS IF THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICY ARE MET, THE LOAN WOULD CONTINUE

TO BE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE FIRM WOULD CONTINUE TO

REPORT THE LOAN IN THE IMPAIRED LOAN TABLE BELOW.

THE TABLES BELOW SET FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRMS IMPAIRED LOANS, EXCLUDING BOTH PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS AND MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS, WHICH ARE SEPARATELY DISCUSSED BELOW.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHOLESALE LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM REVIEWED ITS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TO IDENTIFY HOMEOWNERS MOST IN

NEED OF ASSISTANCE, OPENED NEW REGIONAL COUNSELING CENTERS, HIRED ADDITIONAL LOAN COUNSELORS,

INTRODUCED NEW FINANCING ALTERNATIVES, PROACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO BORROWERS TO OFFER PREQUALIFIED

MODIFICATIONS, AND COMMENCED A NEW PROCESS TO INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW EACH LOAN BEFORE MOVING IT INTO

THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS. IN ADDITION, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE U.S. TREASURY

INTRODUCED THE MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (MHA) PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ASSIST ELIGIBLE

HOMEOWNERS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, ONE OF WHICH IS BY MODIFYING THE TERMS OF THEIR MORTGAGES. THE FIRM

IS PARTICIPATING IN THE MHA PROGRAMS WHILE CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS OTHER LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS

FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE MHA PROGRAMS. THE MHA PROGRAMS AND

THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS FOR FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BORROWERS GENERALLY REPRESENT

VARIOUS CONCESSIONS, SUCH AS TERM EXTENSIONS, RATE REDUCTIONS AND DEFERRAL OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS,

THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT. WHEN THE FIRM

MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS

RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS

194

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION. UNDER ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS, BORROWERS MUST

MAKE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS UNDER THE REVISED CONTRACTUAL TERMS DURING A TRIAL PERIOD AND BE

SUCCESSFULLY RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE THEIR LOAN CAN BE PERMANENTLY

MODIFIED. UPON CONTRACTUAL MODIFICATION, RETAINED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, OTHER THAN

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS.

CONSUMER LOANS WITH BALANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY

MODIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE LOANS, $966 MILLION AND $853 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS NONPERFORMING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ALSO MODIFIED THE TERMS OF CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH BORROWERS WHO HAVE

EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. SUCH MODIFICATIONS MAY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE

CARD AND/OR PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS; IN ALL CASES, THE

FIRM CANCELS THE CUSTOMERS AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT ON THE CREDIT CARD. IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT

COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENT WILL REVERT BACK TO ITS

ORIGINAL PAYMENT TERMS, WITH THE AMOUNT OF ANY LOAN OUTSTANDING REFLECTED IN THE APPROPRIATE

DELINQUENCY BUCKET. THE LOAN AMOUNT MAY THEN BE CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS

STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. UNDER THESE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, $5.1 BILLION AND $2.4 BILLION OF

ON-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT CARD LOANS OUTSTANDINGS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING ITS CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES, THE FIRM HAD ALREADY RECOGNIZED A PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THESE CREDIT CARD

LOANS; ACCORDINGLY THE MODIFICATIONS TO THESE CREDIT CARD LOANS HAD NO INCREMENTAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN LOANS THAT IT

DEEMED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED. WHOLESALE LOANS WITH A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $135 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, DOWN FROM $224 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE

DATE OF ACQUISITION. THESE WHOLESALE LOANS ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR INDIVIDUALLY (NOT ON A POOLED

BASIS) AND ARE REPORTED AS NONPERFORMING LOANS SINCE CASH FLOWS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL LOAN ARE NOT

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. SUCH LOANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, WHICH

RELATES SOLELY TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS WERE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED BASED ON SPECIFIC

RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOAN, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, FICO SCORES, AND

PAST DUE STATUS. PURCHASERS ARE PERMITTED TO AGGREGATE CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE SAME

FISCAL QUARTER INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A

POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE

EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ALL OF THE CONSUMER

LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

THE TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS AT THE

CASH FLOWS FOR ITS PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT

OF THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THESE REFINEMENTS, WHICH

PRIMARILY AFFECTED THE AMOUNT OF THE UNDISCOUNTED INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED

OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOANS, RESULTED IN A $6.8 BILLION INCREASE IN THE FIRMS INITIAL

ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AND THE ACCRETABLE YIELD.

(D)

DATE OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE BY DISCOUNTING THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AT A MARKET OBSERVABLE

DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE, ADJUSTED FOR FACTORS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN

DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. IN DETERMINING THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, MANAGEMENT

INCORPORATED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES AND THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

PREPAYMENTS. CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE REPRESENT THE TOTAL UNDISCOUNTED AMOUNT OF

ALL UNCOLLECTED CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS, BOTH PAST DUE AND DUE IN THE FUTURE,

ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECT OF ESTIMATED PREPAYMENTS.

THE ACCRETABLE YIELD REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT REPORTED ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BUT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE

EXPECTED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF LOANS. FOR VARIABLE RATE LOANS, EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS WERE INITIALLY BASED ON THE RATE IN EFFECT AT ACQUISITION; EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE

RECALCULATED AS RATES CHANGE OVER THE LIVES OF THE LOANS.

OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS INCLUDE THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATED

PREPAYMENTS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS TO THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE FIRM UPDATES THE AMOUNT OF LOAN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, INCORPORATING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE

AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF

IMPAIRMENT, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL LOSS PLUS ANY

RELATED FOREGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT THE POOLS EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. IMPAIRMENTS

THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; ANY REMAINING INCREASES ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY

AS INTEREST INCOME. THE IMPACTS OF (I) PREPAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE INTEREST RATES, AND

(III) ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS

ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME. DISPOSALS OF LOANS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF LOANS, RECEIPT OF

PAYMENTS IN FULL BY THE BORROWER, OR FORECLOSURE, RESULT IN REMOVAL OF THE LOAN FROM THE PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO.

IF THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS WERE

DETERMINED NOT TO BE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO INTEREST WOULD BE ACCRETED AND THE LOANS WOULD BE

REPORTED AS NONPERFORMING LOANS; HOWEVER, SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR

THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, INTEREST IS BEING ACCRETED AND THE

LOANS ARE BEING REPORTED AS PERFORMING LOANS.

CHARGE-OFFS ARE NOT RECORDED ON PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS UNTIL ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED THE

ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT ACQUISITION DATE. TO

DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ARE REPORTED IN LOANS

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN 2009, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.6 BILLION

WAS RECORDED FOR THE PRIME MORTGAGE AND OPTION ARM POOLS OF LOANS. THE NET AGGREGATE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THE POOLS THAT HAVE AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS $47.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THIS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS IN

THE TABLE BELOW.

FIRMS QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND/OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS HAS OCCURRED, AND THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AND REPORTED AS PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES,

WHICH IS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE

REAL PROPERTY (E.G., LAND, BUILDINGS, AND FIXTURES) AND COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (E.G.,

AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS). ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS VALUED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL AT

ACQUISITION. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED, IF

NECESSARY. ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO FAIR VALUE IN THE FIRST 90 DAYS ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES AND THEREAFTER ADJUSTMENTS ARE CHARGED/CREDITED TO NONINTEREST REVENUEOTHER. OPERATING

EXPENSE, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE.

NOTE 14  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT

AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, WHICH INCLUDES ANY LOANS

THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING AS WELL AS RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE

LOANS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR, WHEN AVAILABLE, THE LOANS OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) IS LOWER THAN

THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE,

LARGER LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE SMALLER LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS POOLS USING

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. RISK-RATED LOANS (PRIMARILY

WHOLESALE LOANS) ARE POOLED BY RISK RATING, WHILE SCORED LOANS (I.E., CONSUMER LOANS) ARE POOLED BY

PRODUCT TYPE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MEASURES THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED

INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED

AT THE LOANS ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN MEASURED IMPAIRMENT DUE TO

THE IMPACT OF DISCOUNTING ARE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES, NOT AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST INCOME. AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR AN IMPAIRED LOAN WITH AN OBSERVABLE

MARKET PRICE IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE

LOANS FAIR VALUE.

CERTAIN IMPAIRED LOANS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT ARE CHARGED-OFF TO THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL. WHEN COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT COMMERCIAL REAL-ESTATE LOANS

ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, UPDATED APPRAISALS ARE TYPICALLY OBTAINED AND UPDATED EVERY SIX TO

TWELVE MONTHS. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS BOTH BORROWER- AND MARKET-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHICH

196

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY RESULT IN OBTAINING APPRAISAL UPDATES AT MORE FREQUENT INTERVALS OR BROKER-PRICE OPINIONS IN

THE INTERIM.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND COVERS PERFORMING RISK-RATED

LOANS AND CONSUMER LOANS, EXCEPT FOR LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS. SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 195196 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

FOR RISK-RATED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT (PD) AND AN ESTIMATED LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (LGD). THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY

RISK RATING AND EXPECTED MATURITY. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE

FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE

OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES,

MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS

ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT

AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD

IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE

EXTERNAL THROUGH-THE-CYCLE DATA, USING CREDIT-RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE

BASED ON A STUDY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE.

FOR SCORED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS PERFORMED ON POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK

CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., PRODUCT TYPE) AND GENERALLY COMPUTED AS THE PRODUCT OF ACTUAL OUTSTANDINGS,

AN EXPECTED-LOSS FACTOR AND AN ESTIMATED-LOSS COVERAGE PERIOD. EXPECTED-LOSS FACTORS ARE

STATISTICALLY DERIVED AND CONSIDER HISTORICAL FACTORS SUCH AS LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY. IN

DEVELOPING LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS, THE FIRM CONSIDERS KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HOUSING PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND

OTHER RISK INDICATORS. A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURE IS USED TO DEVELOP LOSS

SEVERITY ESTIMATES ON DEFAULTED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS

(MSA) LEVEL. THESE LOSS SEVERITY ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY VALIDATED BY ACTUAL LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON

DEFAULTED LOANS, MARKET-SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS AND PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY. REAL ESTATE

APPRAISALS ARE UPDATED WHEN THE LOAN IS CHARGED-OFF, ANNUALLY THEREAFTER, AND AT THE TIME OF THE

FINAL FORECLOSURE SALE. FORECASTING METHODS ARE USED TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED-LOSS FACTORS, INCLUDING

CREDIT LOSS FORECASTING MODELS AND VINTAGE-BASED LOSS FORECASTING.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IS NOT

INCLUDED IN THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THE LEVEL AND RESULTS OF SUCH MODIFICATIONS. AS DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 13 ON PAGES 192-196 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, MODIFIED

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED

DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS UPON CONTRACTUAL MODIFICATION AND ARE EVALUATED

FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO MODIFICATION.

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LOANS EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES ARE

INCORPORATED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK TO ADJUST THE RESULTS OF APPLYING THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, ANY ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE

QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS; RELEVANT INTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

CURRENT PORTFOLIO; AND EXTERNAL FACTORS, SUCH AS CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS

THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. FACTORS RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT,

HOUSING PRICES,

AND BOTH CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE

CALCULATION, WHERE RELEVANT. FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR

PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT

ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

NOTE 15  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT

CARD, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE). JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES ARE

STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 142 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT REFLECTED

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW). THE

PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES IS TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS AND TO GENERATE

LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM THROUGH THE SALE OF LOANS TO THE QSPES. THESE QSPES ARE FINANCED THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF FIXED- OR FLOATING-RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 213-214 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, WHICH ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT

OF QSPES AND REVISES THE CRITERIA FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES.

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET.

THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS; (2)

THE ENTITY CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS, OR IF THE ENTITY IS A QSPE, ITS INVESTORS

CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THEIR INTERESTS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL TO

REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY, OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE

THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING SALES CRITERIA, THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED

DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD EXCEPT FOR SERVICING ASSETS WHICH ARE

INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. AT THE TIME OF SALE, ANY RETAINED SERVICING ASSET IS INITIALLY

RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. THE REMAINING CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE

LOANS SOLD AND THE OTHER INTERESTS RETAINED, BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF

SALE. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE RETAINED

INTERESTS BY CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING MODELING TECHNIQUES.

SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT

LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED.

THE FIRM MAY RETAIN INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS IN THE FORM OF UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST,

SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, DEBT AND EQUITY TRANCHES, ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND

SERVICING RIGHTS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE TYPE OF INTEREST, WHETHER OR NOT THE RETAINED INTEREST IS REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY

CERTIFICATE AND WHEN IT WAS RETAINED. INTERESTS RETAINED BY IB ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

SEE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS AND MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS SECTIONS OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THEIR RELATED RETAINED INTERESTS. RETAINED INTERESTS

CLASSIFIED AS AFS THAT ARE RATED BELOW AA BY AN EXTERNAL RATING AGENCY ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT

EVALUATIONS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 ON PAGE 189 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE TOTAL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD IN JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, FOR WHICH SALE ACCOUNTING WAS ACHIEVED AND TO WHICH THE

FIRM HAS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES

SERVICING THE LOANS, HOLDING SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS ACQUIRED AT THE TIME OF

SECURITIZATION, RECOURSE OR GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, THE FIRMS ONLY CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IS SERVICING THE LOANS. IN THE TABLE BELOW, THE

AMOUNT OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE TOTAL RETAINED INTERESTS HELD BY

JPMORGAN CHASE WILL NOT EQUAL THE ASSETS HELD IN QSPES BECAUSE THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY

THIRD PARTY ARE REFLECTED AT THEIR CURRENT OUTSTANDING PAR AMOUNTS AND A PORTION OF THE FIRMS

RETAINED INTERESTS (TRADING ASSETS, AFS SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS) ARE REFLECTED AT THEIR FAIR

VALUE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY BY MAJOR PRODUCT TYPE

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES BY MAJOR

PRODUCT TYPE.

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD SERVICES (CS) BUSINESS SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS, PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE TRUST). IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, THE FIRM ACQUIRED THE SELLERS INTEREST IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST (THE

WMM TRUST) AND ALSO BECAME ITS SPONSOR. THE FIRMS PRIMARY CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST IN THE

RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ESCROW

ACCOUNTS. CS MAINTAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS THAT IT

SPONSORS. AS SERVICER AND TRANSFEROR, THE FIRM RECEIVES CONTRACTUAL SERVICING FEES BASED ON THE

SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE PLUS EXCESS SERVICING FEES, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN CREDIT CARD INCOME AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 ON PAGE 176 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009

DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2009, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS DECLINED, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CREDIT LOSSES INCURRED ON THE

UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES.

CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST: THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE FIRMS PRIMARY ISSUANCE TRUST), WHICH HOLDS

PRIME QUALITY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, MAINTAINED POSITIVE EXCESS SPREAD, A KEY METRIC FOR

EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF A CARD TRUST, THROUGH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2009. IN SPITE OF THIS

POSITIVE EXCESS SPREAD, THE FIRM TOOK CERTAIN ACTIONS, AS PERMITTED BY THE TRUST AGREEMENTS, IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST DUE TO CONTINUING MARKET UNCERTAINTY

CONCERNING PROJECTED CREDIT COSTS IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY, AND TO MITIGATE ANY FURTHER

DETERIORATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST. ON MAY 12, 2009, THE FIRM INCREASED THE REQUIRED

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT LEVEL FOR EACH TRANCHE OF OUTSTANDING NOTES ISSUED BY THE TRUST, BY INCREASING

THE MINIMUM REQUIRED AMOUNT OF SUBORDINATED NOTES AND THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TRUSTS CASH

ESCROW ACCOUNTS. ON JUNE 1, 2009, THE FIRM BEGAN DESIGNATING AS DISCOUNT RECEIVABLES A PERCENTAGE

OF NEW CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES FOR INCLUSION IN THE TRUST, THEREBY REQUIRING COLLECTIONS OF SUCH

DISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES TO BE APPLIED AS FINANCE CHARGE COLLECTIONS IN THE TRUST, WHICH INCREASED

THE EXCESS SPREAD FOR THE TRUST. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO DISCONTINUE DESIGNATING A PERCENTAGE OF NEW

RECEIVABLES AS DISCOUNT RECEIVABLES ON JULY 1, 2010. ALSO, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, THE

FIRM EXCHANGED $3.5 BILLION OF ITS UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST IN THE TRUST FOR $3.5 BILLION PAR

VALUE OF ZERO-COUPON SUBORDINATED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST AND RETAINED BY THE FIRM. THE

ISSUANCE OF THE ZERO-COUPON SECURITIES BY THE TRUST ALSO INCREASED THE EXCESS SPREAD FOR THE TRUST.

THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS FOR

REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH DECREASED THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO BY APPROXIMATELY 40

BASIS POINTS, BUT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WMM TRUST: AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKING OPERATIONS, THE ASSETS

OF THE WMM TRUST WERE COMPRISED OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL SUBPRIME CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. THE QUALITY

OF THE ASSETS IN THE WMM TRUST WAS MUCH LOWER THAN THE QUALITY OF THE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS HISTORICALLY SECURITIZED IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

IN ORDER TO MORE CLOSELY CONFORM THE WMM TRUST TO THE OVERALL QUALITY TYPICAL OF A JPMORGAN

CHASESPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION MASTER TRUST, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 THE FIRM

RANDOMLY REMOVED $6.2 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS HELD BY THE WMM TRUST AND REPLACED THEM WITH

$5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER-QUALITY RECEIVABLES FROM THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO.

HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED DETERIORATION DURING 2009 IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE REMAINING

WASHINGTON MUTUALORIGINATED ASSETS IN THE WMM TRUST, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO INDICATED

THAT AN EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT WAS LIKELY TO OCCUR UNLESS ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WERE TAKEN. ON MAY

15, 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE, AS SELLER AND SERVICER, AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, AS TRUSTEE,

AMENDED THE POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT TO PERMIT NON-RANDOM REMOVALS OF CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.

ON MAY 19, 2009, THE FIRM REMOVED ALL REMAINING CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON

MUTUAL. FOLLOWING THIS REMOVAL, THE WMM TRUST COLLATERAL WAS ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF RECEIVABLES

ORIGINATED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM, THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THE WMM TRUST WERE CONSOLIDATED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF JPMORGAN CHASE;

AS A RESULT, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM RECORDED ADDITIONAL ASSETS WITH AN INITIAL FAIR VALUE

OF $6.0 BILLION, LIABILITIES WITH AN INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF $6.1 BILLION, AND A PRETAX LOSS OF

APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION.

RETAINED INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS THAT

WERE NOT CONSOLIDATED AT THE DATES PRESENTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN THE WMM

TRUST ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, BUT NO LONGER INCLUDED AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, DUE TO THE SECOND QUARTER ACTIONS NOTED ABOVE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE WMM

TRUST ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 206214 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS (WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM 4% TO 12%). THESE UNDIVIDED INTERESTS

IN THE TRUSTS REPRESENT THE FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST

THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SECURITIZED; THESE UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY SECURITY

CERTIFICATES, ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST, AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LOANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, THE FIRM HAD $16.7 BILLION AND $33.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ITS UNDIVIDED

INTERESTS IN THE TRUSTS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES

IN THE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 16% AND 22% FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

200

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM RETAINED A SUBORDINATED INTEREST IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES ON THE SECURITIZED

RECEIVABLES TOTALING $3.2 BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY,

WHICH IS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN OTHER ASSETS.

THE FIRM RETAINED SUBORDINATED SECURITIES IN ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS WITH AGGREGATE

FAIR VALUES OF $6.6 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND

SENIOR SECURITIES WITH AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES OF $7.2 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE SECURITIES RETAINED, $13.8 BILLION AND $5.4 BILLION WERE CLASSIFIED

AS AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE SENIOR AFS SECURITIES WERE USED

BY THE FIRM AS COLLATERAL FOR A SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTION. THE RETAINED SUBORDINATED INTERESTS

THAT WERE ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS HAD A

CARRYING VALUE OF $389 MILLION ON DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE RETAINED SUBORDINATED INTERESTS WERE

SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID OR VALUED AT ZERO BEFORE THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED THE WMM TRUST IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2009, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO PREDETERMINED LIMITS FOR SOME CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS TO COVER DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS OWED TO INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN

SUCH ESCROW ACCOUNTS RELATED TO CREDIT CARDS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMOUNTED TO $1.0

BILLION AND $74 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE BALANCE

OF THESE ESCROW ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE TRUST ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT THE FIRM TOOK

ON MAY 12, 2009. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ALSO RECORDED $854 MILLION REPRESENTING RECEIVABLES THAT HAVE

BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST AND DESIGNATED AS DISCOUNT RECEIVABLES. ALL OF THESE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN OTHER ASSETS.

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND ORIGINATED COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGES.

RFS SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT IT ORIGINATES AND PURCHASES AND IT GENERALLY

RETAINS SERVICING FOR ALL OF ITS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND CERTAIN

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. ADDITIONALLY, RFS MAY RETAIN SERVICING FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS

PURCHASED BY IB. AS SERVICER, THE FIRM RECEIVES SERVICING FEES BASED ON THE SECURITIZED LOAN

BALANCE PLUS ANCILLARY FEES. IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF SECURITIZATIONS, RFS MAY RETAIN AN INTEREST IN

ADDITION TO SERVICING RIGHTS. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RETAINED RELATED TO THESE SECURITIZATIONS

TOTALED $537 MILLION AND $939 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RETAINED

INTERESTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS TRADING OR AFS SECURITIES (IF REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY CERTIFICATE)

OR OTHER ASSETS (IF NOT REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY CERTIFICATE).

IB SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS (INCLUDING THOSE THAT IT PURCHASED AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE

LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS), AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT IT ORIGINATED. RESIDENTIAL LOANS

SECURITIZED BY IB ARE OFTEN SERVICED BY RFS. UPON SECURITIZATION, IB MAY ENGAGE IN UNDERWRITING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUST. IB MAY RETAIN UNSOLD

SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS) IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION. THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS

RETAINED WAS $24 MILLION AND $155 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

ADDITIONALLY, IB RETAINED $2.3 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION OF SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY TABLES BELOW, THE FIRM SOLD

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $147.9 BILLION, $122.0 BILLION AND $81.8 BILLION DURING THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE LOAN SALES WERE

FOR SECURITIZATION BY GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (GNMA), FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE

ASSOCIATION (FANNIE MAE) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC). THE FIRM

RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THESE LOANS AND THEY ARE SERVICED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGENCYS

SERVICING GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS. THESE SALES RESULTED IN PRETAX GAINS OF $92 MILLION, $32

MILLION AND $47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN SALES, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO SHARE UP TO 100% OF THE CREDIT RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLD LOANS WITH THE PURCHASER. SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGE 233 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION RELATED

INDEMNIFICATIONS.

OTHER SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM ALSO SECURITIZES AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS AND PURCHASED CONSUMER

LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS). THE FIRM RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL

ORIGINATED AND CERTAIN PURCHASED STUDENT AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS. IT MAY ALSO HOLD A RETAINED INTEREST

IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS; SUCH RESIDUAL INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM HELD $9 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZED AUTOMOBILE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND $49 MILLION AND $52 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED STUDENT LOANS.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON

A 10% OR 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED EASILY, BECAUSE THE

RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO,

IN THE TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT COUNTERACT OR MAGNIFY THE SENSITIVITIES. THE ABOVE SENSITIVITIES

ALSO DO NOT REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT MAY BE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE SUCH

RISKS.

SECURITIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDES: $145.0 BILLION AND $152.4

BILLION OF SECURITIZED LOANS, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS NO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT; $16.7 BILLION

AND $33.3 BILLION OF SELLERS INTERESTS IN CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUSTS; AND $8.3 BILLION AND

SECURITIZED.

(G)

INCLUDES SECURITIZED LOANS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS

TRADING ASSETS.

(H)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, NONPERFORMING LOANS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $9.0 BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY; (2) STUDENT LOANS

THAT WERE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM, OF $542 MILLION AND $437 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED, AS REIMBURSEMENT IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRMS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF

THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING

NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(I)

EXCLUDES PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS,

THE PAST DUE STATUS OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS,

THEY ARE ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING.

(J)

INCLUDES NONPERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE OF $345 MILLION AND $32

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 16  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE 142 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES

POLICIES REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES OCCURS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANK: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A

COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. IB IS INVOLVED WITH VIES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND FOR INVESTOR

INTERMEDIATION PURPOSES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. IB ALSO SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH QSPES, TO

CREATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES 198-205 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM): THE LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURES FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS SPONSORED

AND MANAGED BY ASSET MANAGEMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES WITHIN THE STRUCTURE WHICH ARE DEEMED

VIES. AS ASSET MANAGER OF THE FUNDS, AM EARNS A FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES

WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THOSE LIMITED NUMBER OF

FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AMS RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH FUNDS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT

VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER U.S. GAAP.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES. THE

RELATIONSHIPS RESULTING FROM TSS SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE

INTERESTS.



COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB): UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS

IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO

THOSE OFFERED IN IB. CB MAY ASSIST IN THE STRUCTURING AND/OR ONGOING ADMINISTRATION OF THESE

VIES AND MAY PROVIDE LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF

THE VIE. THE RELATIONSHIPS RESULTING FROM CBS SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT

VARIABLE INTERESTS.



CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY: CORPORATE UTILIZES VIES TO ISSUE GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. SEE NOTE 22 ON PAGES 220-221 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS,

WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT COULD BE DEEMED VIES.

PRIVATE EQUITY ENTITIES ARE TYPICALLY INVESTMENT COMPANIES AS DEFINED IN THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND, AS SUCH, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO UTILIZE THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. HAD THE GUIDANCE FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VIES BEEN APPLIED TO

THESE ENTITIES, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL TO THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

AS NOTED ABOVE, IB IS PREDOMINANTLY INVOLVED WITH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND VIES ASSOCIATED WITH

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES. THESE NONCONSOLIDATED VIES THAT ARE SPONSORED BY JPMORGAN CHASE

ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FIRM CONSIDERS A SPONSORED VIE TO INCLUDE ANY ENTITY WHERE: (1) JPMORGAN

CHASE IS THE PRINCIPAL

BENEFICIARY OF THE STRUCTURE; (2) THE VIE IS USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO

SECURITIZE FIRM ASSETS; (3) THE VIE ISSUES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JPMORGAN CHASE

BRAND NAME; OR (4) THE ENTITY IS A JPMORGAN CHASE-ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER

(ABCP) CONDUIT.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, AND IT HELPS CUSTOMERS

MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN

AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITIES

THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND

LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY

SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST

INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE

CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) TO THE CONDUITS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS

ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS,

AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE

ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS,

LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES.

THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH

THE CONDUITS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES FEES FOR STRUCTURING MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND COMPENSATION

FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND

PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

TO ENSURE TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A

MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND GENERALLY

STRUCTURED SO THE LIQUIDITY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE FIRM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WILL BE

AFFECTED BY THE FIRM PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL OF NONDEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS. IN

LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO PERFORM UNDER ITS ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CONDUIT AT ANY TIME. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER,

INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE CONDUIT AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS THEN

CURRENT FAIR VALUE  IN EFFECT, PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET

AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT VEHICLES WITH PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IN

THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED SHORT-TERM REVOLVING FACILITIES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS TO

HANDLE FUNDING INCREMENTS TOO SMALL TO BE FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND IN THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS ONLY IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM

DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET.

BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES WILL ONLY FUND NONDEFAULTED ASSETS,

PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS

REQUIRED TO ABSORB LOSSES ON DEFAULTED RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF

LOSSES ABSORBED BY ANY DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT MAY BE

PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OR BY THIRD-PARTY SURETY BOND

PROVIDERS. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED VARIES BY CONDUIT AND RANGES

BETWEEN 5% AND 10% OF THE APPLICABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT IS OUTSTANDING.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. ON MAY 31, 2009,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ONE OF THESE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF THE EXPECTED LOSS

(A)

THE RATINGS SCALE IS PRESENTED ON AN S&P EQUIVALENT BASIS.

(B)

WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE FOR EACH ASSET TYPE IS BASED ON THE REMAINING TERM OF EACH

CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS COMMITTED LIQUIDITY PLUS EITHER THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF

THE ASSETS SHOULD THE COMMITTED LIQUIDITY EXPIRE WITHOUT RENEWAL OR THE EXPECTED TIME TO SELL

THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

THE ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT IF THEY WERE RATED,

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD RECEIVE AN A RATING OR BETTER BY EXTERNAL RATING

AGENCIES. HOWEVER, IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THE ASSETS HELD BY THE CONDUITS TO BE EXPLICITLY RATED BY AN

EXTERNAL RATING AGENCY. INSTEAD, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK GROUP ASSIGNS EACH ASSET PURCHASE LIQUIDITY

FACILITY AN INTERNAL RISK RATING BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT FOR THE

TRANSACTION. THE RATINGS PROVIDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE REFLECT THE S&P-EQUIVALENT RATINGS OF THE

INTERNAL RATING GRADES ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM.

THE RISK RATINGS ARE PERIODICALLY REASSESSED AS INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008, 95% AND 90%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE ASSETS IN THE NONCONSOLIDATED CONDUITS WERE

RISK-RATED A OR BETTER.

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY NONCONSOLIDATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WAS 19 DAYS AND 27 DAYS, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS 0.2% AND 0.6%, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE

TRADES AND INVESTS IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, INCLUDING PAPER ISSUED BY THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS.

THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PURCHASED BY THE FIRM FROM ALL FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS DURING

2009, RANGED FROM LESS THAN 1% TO APPROXIMATELY 5.8% ON ANY GIVEN DAY. THE LARGEST DAILY AMOUNT OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING HELD BY THE FIRM IN ANY ONE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT DURING 2009 WAS

APPROXIMATELY $852 MILLION, OR 11.6%, OF THE CONDUITS COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. THE FIRM IS

NOT OBLIGATED UNDER ANY AGREEMENT (CONTRACTUAL OR NONCONTRACTUAL) TO PURCHASE THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUED BY

NONCONSOLIDATED JPMORGAN CHASE-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS.

208

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

EACH NONCONSOLIDATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ADMINISTERED BY THE FIRM AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008,

HAD ISSUED ELNS, THE HOLDERS OF WHICH ARE COMMITTED TO ABSORBING THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSS

OF EACH RESPECTIVE CONDUIT. THE TOTAL AMOUNTS OF ELNS OUTSTANDING FOR NONCONSOLIDATED CONDUITS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WERE $96 MILLION AND $136 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM COULD FUND PURCHASES OF ASSETS FROM NONCONSOLIDATED, FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY.

IMPLIED SUPPORT

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY ELN HOLDERS FROM

POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE CONDUITS HOLDINGS AND HAS NO PLANS TO REMOVE ANY ASSETS FROM ANY

CONDUIT UNLESS REQUIRED TO DO SO IN ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATOR. SHOULD SUCH A TRANSFER OCCUR, THE

FIRM WOULD ALLOCATE LOSSES ON SUCH ASSETS BETWEEN ITSELF AND THE ELN HOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ELN.

EXPECTED LOSS MODELING

IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS THE FIRM USES A MONTE CARLOBASED MODEL

TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF EACH OF THE CONDUITS AND CONSIDERS THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND

OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE FIRMS EXPECTED LOSS MODELING TREATS

ALL VARIABLE INTERESTS, OTHER THAN THE ELNS, AS ITS OWN TO DETERMINE CONSOLIDATION. THE

VARIABILITY TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MODELING OF EXPECTED LOSSES IS BASED ON THE DESIGN OF THE

ENTITY. THE FIRMS TRADITIONAL MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE DESIGNED TO PASS CREDIT RISK, NOT

LIQUIDITY RISK, TO ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, AS THE ASSETS ARE INTENDED TO BE HELD IN THE

CONDUIT FOR THE LONGER TERM.

THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO RUN THE MONTE CARLO-BASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH TIME A

RECONSIDERATION EVENT OCCURS. IN APPLYING THIS GUIDANCE TO THE CONDUITS, THE FOLLOWING EVENTS

ARE CONSIDERED TO BE RECONSIDERATION EVENTS, AS THEY COULD AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS.



NEW DEALS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL VARIABLE INTERESTS (CREDIT SUPPORT,

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC.);



CHANGES IN USAGE, INCLUDING THE CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING VARIABLE INTERESTS

(CREDIT SUPPORT, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC.);



MODIFICATIONS OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND



SALES OF INTERESTS HELD BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT RUN ITS MONTE CARLOBASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL

EVERY TIME THERE IS A RECONSIDERATION EVENT DUE TO THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR OCCURRENCE. INSTEAD, THE

FIRM RUNS ITS EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH QUARTER AND INCLUDES A GROWTH ASSUMPTION FOR EACH CONDUIT TO

ENSURE THAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF ELNS EXISTS FOR EACH CONDUIT AT ANY POINT DURING THE QUARTER.

AS PART OF ITS NORMAL QUARTERLY MODELING, THE FIRM UPDATES, WHEN APPLICABLE, THE INPUTS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE EXPECTED LOSS MODEL. SPECIFICALLY, RISK RATINGS AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT

ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USED WERE

REFLECTIVE OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED THE PROBABILITY OF

CHANGES TO RISK RATINGS AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULTS.

QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT MEANS FOR CLIENTS TO

ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE CONDUITS EFFECTIVELY DISPERSE RISK AMONG

ALL PARTIES AND THAT THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE ECONOMIC RISK IN THE FIRMS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IS

NOT HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN THESE STRUCTURING

ACTIVITIES ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES, ASSET SWAP VEHICLES AND

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM HAS CREATED A SERIES OF SECONDARY MARKET TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH

QUALIFYING TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE

THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES

FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF

SECURITIES: (1) PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

(RESIDUAL INTERESTS). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING

MUNICIPAL BONDS IS LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY PUT, OR TENDER,

THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. UPON TERMINATION OF THE

VEHICLE, IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO

REPAY THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY, THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE EITHER TO EXCESS

COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

THE THIRD-PARTY HOLDERS OF THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN THESE VEHICLES COULD EXPERIENCE LOSSES IF THE

FACE AMOUNT OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES EXCEEDS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL

BONDS UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE. CERTAIN VEHICLES REQUIRE A SMALLER INITIAL INVESTMENT BY THE

RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND THUS DO NOT RESULT IN EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION. FOR THESE VEHICLES

THERE EXISTS A REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION WHICH REQUIRES THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS TO POST,

DURING THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO THE VEHICLE ON A DAILY BASIS AS THE MARKET

VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

209

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER AND REMARKETING AGENT OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS

LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS; WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL

BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AND THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO

BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. A DOWNGRADE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S SHORT-TERM RATING DOES NOT

AFFECT THE FIRMS OBLIGATION UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN

THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS SUPPORTED BY THOSE

LIQUIDITY FACILITY COMMITMENTS MIGHT CHOOSE TO SELL THEIR INSTRUMENTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS COULD BE DRAWN. IN VEHICLES IN WHICH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, IN ADDITION TO THE TERMINATION EVENTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE AS

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS,

THE EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE, OR THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST HOLDERS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, A DRAWDOWN OCCURRED ON ONE LIQUIDITY FACILITY AS A

RESULT OF A FAILURE TO REMARKET PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO

PURCHASE $19 MILLION OF PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLE WAS TERMINATED AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS, TOGETHER WITH THE

COLLATERAL POSTED BY THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER, WERE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. IN 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT EXPERIENCE A DRAWDOWN ON THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, THE FIRM HELD $72 MILLION AND $293 MILLION

OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM AT

ANY TIME DURING 2009 WAS $1.0 BILLION, OR 6.7%, OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES OUTSTANDING PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT

ANY RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND HOLDINGS.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND TO THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND. A DOWNGRADE OF A BOND INSURER WOULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE OF THE INSURED

MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE RATING OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THIS

COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR, AS PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS TYPICALLY REQUIRE AN AA- BOND RATING. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, 98% AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS HELD BY VEHICLES TO WHICH THE FIRM SERVED

AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WERE RATED AA- OR BETTER, BASED ON EITHER THE RATING OF THE UNDERLYING

MUNICIPAL BOND ITSELF, OR THE RATING INCLUDING ANY CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND

2008, $2.3 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE BONDS WERE INSURED BY MONOLINE BOND

INSURERS.

THE FIRM SOMETIMES INVESTS IN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS OF MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. FOR VIES IN WHICH

THE FIRM OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE VIES.

THE LIKELIHOOD IS REMOTE THAT THE FIRM WOULD HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE VIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT

OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS AND THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFF-BALANCE SHEET.

EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED MUNICIPAL BOND VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, INCLUDING THE

THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT HOLD. THE VIE

THEN ISSUES CLNS WITH MATURITIES PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER

THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE VIES INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER USING

A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN SUCH

NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE CLN VEHICLES IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE VIE,

AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM HAS NOT HISTORICALLY PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CLN VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLN VEHICLES. AS

A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE

COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE

COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES IS LARGELY INVESTMENT-GRADE, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT BEING

RATED AAA. THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURES BROADLY INTO TWO TYPES: STATIC AND

MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT EITHER

REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATION), OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED PORTFOLIO

OF CREDITS. THE FIRM GENERALLY BUYS PROTECTION FROM THE VIE UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE. IN A

MANAGED CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE GENERALLY REFERENCE

ALL OR PART OF AN ACTIVELY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. AN AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN A PORTFOLIO

MANAGER AND THE VIE THAT GIVES THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE EACH REFERENCED

CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CREDIT. BY PARTICIPATING IN A STRUCTURE WHERE A

PORTFOLIO MANAGER HAS THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE CREDITS WITHIN PRE-AGREED TERMS, THE INVESTORS WHO

OWN THE CLNS SEEK TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT ANY SINGLE CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL DEFAULT. THE FIRM

DOES NOT ACT AS PORTFOLIO MANAGER; ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO BEING A

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, IN BOTH STATIC AND MANAGED

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURES, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A

PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE OF THE CREDITS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO

DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF REFERENCE CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS.

ARE STRUCTURED AT INCEPTION SO THAT THE PAR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

SUFFICIENT TO PAY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

THE FIRM ALSO STRUCTURES AND EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET SWAP VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS.

IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THE VIE PURCHASES A SPECIFIC ASSET OR ASSETS AND THEN ENTERS INTO A

DERIVATIVE WITH THE FIRM IN ORDER TO TAILOR THE INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY RISK, OR BOTH, OF THE

ASSETS ACCORDING TO INVESTORS REQUIREMENTS. GENERALLY, THE ASSETS ARE HELD BY THE VIE TO MATURITY,

AND THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVES WOULD MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE ASSETS. INVESTORS TYPICALLY INVEST

IN THE NOTES ISSUED BY SUCH VIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE SPECIFIC

ASSETS, AS WELL AS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR

SPECIFIC NEEDS. THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE VIE MAY INCLUDE CURRENCY SWAPS

TO HEDGE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY INTO THE INVESTORS HOME OR

INVESTMENT CURRENCY OR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE INTEREST RATE

RISK OF ASSETS HELD BY THE

VIE; TO ADD ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE INTO THE VIE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RETURN ON THE

ISSUED NOTES; OR TO CONVERT AN INTEREST-BEARING ASSET INTO A ZERO-COUPON BOND.

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE INTEREST RATE AND/OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE

ANY CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HISTORICALLY HAS NOT PROVIDED

ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES. AS A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES

ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES ARE

INVESTMENT-GRADE.

VEHICLES ARE STRUCTURED AT INCEPTION SO THAT THE PAR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

SUFFICIENT TO PAY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS VEHICLES

A CDO TYPICALLY REFERS TO A SECURITY THAT IS COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF BONDS, LOANS, EQUITY,

DERIVATIVES OR OTHER ASSETS. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CDO VEHICLE MAY TAKE ONE OR

MORE OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS: ARRANGER, WAREHOUSE FUNDING PROVIDER, PLACEMENT AGENT OR UNDERWRITER,

SECONDARY MARKET-MAKER FOR SECURITIES ISSUED, OR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM HAD FUNDED NONINVESTMENT-GRADE LOANS OF $156 MILLION AND

$405 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO NONCONSOLIDATED CDO WAREHOUSE VIES. THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO

LOSS RELATED TO THE NONCONSOLIDATED CDO WAREHOUSE VIES WAS $156 MILLION AND $1.1 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

ONCE THE CDO VEHICLE CLOSES AND ISSUES SECURITIES, THE FIRM HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FURTHER

SUPPORT TO THE VEHICLE. AT THE TIME OF CLOSING, THE FIRM MAY HOLD UNSOLD SECURITIES THAT IT WAS NOT

ABLE TO PLACE WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ON OCCASION HOLD SOME OF THE

CDO VEHICLES SECURITIES AS A SECONDARY MARKET-MAKER OR AS A PRINCIPAL INVESTOR, OR IT MAY BE A

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO THE VEHICLES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT.

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

INVESTMENT IN A THIRD-PARTY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST

THE FIRM HOLDS A NOTE IN A THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED VIE, WHICH IS A CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST

THAT OWNS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ISSUED BY A NATIONAL RETAILER. THE NOTE IS STRUCTURED SO THAT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT CAN FLOAT UP TO 47% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE RECEIVABLES HELD BY THE TRUST,

NOT TO EXCEED $4.2 BILLION.

THE FIRM IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE TRUST AND ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE

WITHIN AFS INVESTMENT SECURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE NOTE WAS

$3.5 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS

$3.5 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON AFS SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 11 ON PAGES 187-191 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

VIE USED IN FRBNY TRANSACTION

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, IN JUNE 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

(FRBNY) TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH AN LLC FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF A PORTFOLIO OF $30.0 BILLION IN

ASSETS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE LLC WERE FUNDED

BY A $28.85 BILLION TERM LOAN FROM THE FRBNY AND A $1.15 BILLION SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN IS SUBORDINATED TO THE FRBNY LOAN AND WILL BEAR THE FIRST $1.15

BILLION OF ANY LOSSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF

THE FRBNY LOAN, REPAYMENT OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LLC WILL BE FOR THE

ACCOUNT OF THE FRBNY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FRBNY AND JPMORGAN CHASE LOANS WILL BE REPAID WILL

DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSET PORTFOLIO AND THE LIQUIDATION STRATEGY DIRECTED BY THE FRBNY.

OTHER VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE INCLUDE, FOR

EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT

AGENT, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL

CREDIT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO ABSORB A

MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES, OR TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS, THE FIRM RECORDS

AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, SIMILARLY TO THE WAY IT WOULD

RECORD AND REPORT POSITIONS FROM ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT

CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT.

DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN CHASE. INCLUDED IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(INCLUDING SECURITIZATION ENTITIES)

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF QSPES AND PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE GUIDANCE ALSO

CHANGES THE APPROACH FOR DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE FROM A QUANTITATIVE RISK AND

REWARD MODEL TO A QUALITATIVE MODEL, BASED ON CONTROL AND ECONOMICS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE FOR VIES ON JANUARY 1, 2010, WHICH REQUIRED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE

FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, BANK-ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS,

AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE VIES

ADDED APPROXIMATELY $88 BILLION AND $92 BILLION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE

NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRIOR

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE NET IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WAS A REDUCTION IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION AND IN TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO BY APPROXIMATELY 30

BASIS POINTS, DRIVEN PREDOMINANTLY

BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF

APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION (PRE-TAX) RELATED TO THE RECEIVABLES HELD IN THE CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED AT THE ADOPTION DATE.

THE U.S. GAAP CONSOLIDATION OF THESE ENTITIES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS ON THE ADOPTION DATE; THIS WAS DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION, FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES, OF

THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE FIRMS PRIMARY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST) IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2009, WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 198-205 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES RELATING TO

THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE FOR VIES THAT PERMITTED AN OPTIONAL TWO-QUARTER IMPLEMENTATION DELAY,

WHICH DEFERS THE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM ELECTED THIS REGULATORY IMPLEMENTATION DELAY, AS PERMITTED UNDER THESE NEW REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES, FOR ITS

BANK-ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED

IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB FINALIZED AN AMENDMENT THAT DEFERS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSOLIDATION

GUIDANCE FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, AND HEDGE

FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS INCLUDED IN THE DEFERRAL, THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE CONSOLIDATION

UNDER OTHER EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE; THESE FUNDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE IMPACT NOTED

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED UPON COMPLETION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

PURCHASE PRICE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECORDED

AT THEIR FAIR VALUE UPON COMPLETION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS, AND

GENERALLY REPRESENT THE VALUE OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR ARRANGEMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL DURING 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FINAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

RELATED TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, AND THE ACQUISITION OF A COMMODITIES BUSINESS, EACH PRIMARILY

ALLOCATED TO IB, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE FIRMS CANADIAN CREDIT

CARD OPERATIONS, WHICH WERE ALLOCATED TO CARD SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL DURING 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE

(ALLOCATED TO CARD SERVICES), THE MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS, THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL EQUITY

INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE AND TAX-RELATED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANK ONE

MERGER (WHICH WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO IB).

THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE RELATED REPORTING UNITS,

WHICH ARE DETERMINED BASED ON HOW THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED AND HOW THEY ARE REVIEWED BY

THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS GOODWILL ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION, GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS

CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT. GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OR 2008,

NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DUE TO IMPAIRMENT DURING 2009, 2008 OR 2007.

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE

OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE

IS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL IS

CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING

GOODWILL), THEN A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT (AS

DETERMINED IN STEP ONE) TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS

OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE BEING ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE

RESULTING IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR

VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IS

LESS THAN ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

THE PRIMARY METHOD THE FIRM USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS THE INCOME

APPROACH. THE MODELS PROJECT LEVERED CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND USE THE PERPETUITY

GROWTH METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUES. THESE CASH FLOWS AND TERMINAL VALUES ARE THEN

DISCOUNTED USING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. PROJECTIONS OF CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE REPORTING

UNITS FORECASTS AND REVIEWED WITH THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM. THE FIRMS COST OF EQUITY

IS DETERMINED USING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL, WHICH

214

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IS CONSISTENT WITH METHODOLOGIES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THE FIRM USES WHEN ADVISING CLIENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT

REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT AND IS DETERMINED

BASED ON THE FIRMS OVERALL COST OF EQUITY, AS ADJUSTED FOR THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO

EACH REPORTING UNIT, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK OR UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

BUSINESS OR MANAGEMENTS FORECASTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE DISCOUNT

RATES USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, MANAGEMENT COMPARES THE DISCOUNT RATE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF

EQUITY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS. IN

ADDITION, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF EQUITY (AGGREGATING THE VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS) IS COMPARED

WITH THE FIRMS OVERALL COST OF EQUITY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS.

THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH MARKET-BASED

TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES FOR RELEVANT COMPETITORS. PRECISE CONCLUSIONS GENERALLY CAN NOT

BE DRAWN FROM THESE COMPARISONS DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES THAT NATURALLY EXIST BETWEEN THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED AS

GENERAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE GENERAL REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. MANAGEMENT

ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS REPORTING

UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASES MARKET CAPITALIZATION. IN EVALUATING THIS COMPARISON, MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING (A) A CONTROL PREMIUM THAT WOULD EXIST IN A MARKET

TRANSACTION, (B) FACTORS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION RISK THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE FIRM-WIDE

LEVEL THAT DO NOT EXIST AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AND (C) SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS.

WHILE NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS RECOGNIZED DURING 2009, THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES

IN RFS AND CARD SERVICES HAVE ELEVATED RISK OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THEIR EXPOSURE

TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK. THE VALUATION OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT UPON

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, AND HOME PRICES) AND POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE AND

REGULATORY CHANGES THAT AFFECT CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THEIR BUSINESS MODELS. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED

IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS FOR THESE BUSINESSES, AND THE VALUES OF THE ASSOCIATED NET

ASSETS, WERE DETERMINED USING MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES, AND THE COST OF EQUITY REFLECTED THE

RISK AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THESE BUSINESSES AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON TO RELEVANT MARKET PEERS.

DETERIORATION IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO

DECLINE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO

SOME PORTION OF THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SPECIFIED

MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES (PREDOMINANTLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE) FOR OTHERS. MSRS

ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS;

MAKING TAX AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE

INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE FIRM HAS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE MADE THIS DETERMINATION BASED ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS USED TO MEASURE ITS MSR ASSET AT FAIR VALUE AND ITS TREATMENT OF MSRS

AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM ELECTED TO

ACCOUNT FOR THIS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF

MSRS USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL (OAS), WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE

INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PREPAYMENT MODEL AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE

CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY

SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY

REVENUE AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND PERIODICALLY

ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET. DURING 2009 AND

2008, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL BASED ON A NUMBER OF

MARKET-RELATED FACTORS, INCLUDING A DOWNWARD TREND IN HOME PRICES, GENERAL TIGHTENING OF CREDIT

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON REFINANCING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES OR HAS USED COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES TO

MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. MSRS DECREASE IN

VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES),

PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

IMPAIRMENT

THE FIRMS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR

MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE

FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. CORE DEPOSITS AND CREDIT

CARD RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, ARE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN A

MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF

THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET COMPARES THE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS

CARRYING VALUE. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN NO

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET

EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. JPMORGAN CHASE COMPUTES DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD COMPUTED OVER THE LESSER OF THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASED FACILITY OR THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE LEASED ASSET. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED IMMATERIAL ASSET RETIREMENT

ESTIMATE THE OBLIGATIONS FAIR VALUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF

ON OCTOBER 3, 2008, THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 (THE 2008 ACT) WAS SIGNED

INTO LAW. THE 2008 ACT TEMPORARILY INCREASED THE STANDARD MAXIMUM FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FROM

$100,000 TO $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR PER INSTITUTION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. ON MAY 20, 2009, THE

HELPING FAMILIES SAVE THEIR HOMES ACT OF 2009 (THE 2009 ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE 2009 ACT

EXTENDS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FDICS TEMPORARY STANDARD MAXIMUM DEPOSIT INSURANCE AMOUNT

OF $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR. ON JANUARY 1, 2014, THE STANDARD MAXIMUM DEPOSIT INSURANCE AMOUNT WILL

RETURN TO $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR FOR ALL DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS EXCEPT INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS

(IRAS) AND CERTAIN OTHER RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, WHICH WILL REMAIN AT $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR.

IN ADDITION, ON NOVEMBER 21, 2008, THE FDIC RELEASED A FINAL RULE ON THE FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY

GUARANTEE PROGRAM (THE TLG PROGRAM). UNDER ONE COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM, THE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT

GUARANTEE PROGRAM (THE TAG PROGRAM) PROVIDES UNLIMITED DEPOSIT INSURANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2009, ON CERTAIN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AT FDIC-INSURED PARTICIPATING

INSTITUTIONS. ON DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE FIRM ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TLG PROGRAM AND, AS A

RESULT, WAS REQUIRED TO PAY ADDITIONAL INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO THE FDIC IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AN

ANNUALIZED 10 BASIS POINTS ON BALANCES IN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS THAT EXCEEDED

THE $250,000 FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE LIMITS, AS DETERMINED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THE EXPIRATION DATE

OF THE PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED BY SIX MONTHS, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, TO JUNE 30, 2010, TO PROVIDE

CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PHASE OUT

THE PROGRAM IN AN ORDERLY MANNER. ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE FIRM NOTIFIED THE FDIC THAT, AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2010, IT WOULD NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE TAG PROGRAM. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS

DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THE PROGRAM, AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2009, FUNDS HELD IN NONINTEREST-BEARING

TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS WILL NO LONGER BE GUARANTEED IN FULL, BUT WILL BE INSURED UP TO $250,000 UNDER

THE FDICS GENERAL DEPOSIT RULES.

ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ESTABLISHED A SPECIAL LENDING FACILITY, THE

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY FACILITY (AML FACILITY), TO

PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO ELIGIBLE U.S. MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS. UNDER THE AML FACILITY, BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS MUST USE THE LOAN PROCEEDS TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES OF ELIGIBLE HIGH-QUALITY

ABCP INVESTMENTS FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, WHICH ARE PLEDGED TO SECURE NONRECOURSE

ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON (FRBB). PARTICIPATING BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

DO NOT BEAR ANY CREDIT OR MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE ABCP INVESTMENTS THEY HOLD UNDER THIS

FACILITY; THEREFORE, THE ABCP INVESTMENTS HELD ARE NOT ASSESSED ANY REGULATORY CAPITAL. THE

AML FACILITY ENDED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2010. THE NONRECOURSE ADVANCES FROM THE FRBB WERE ELECTED

UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AND RECORDED IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; THE CORRESPONDING ABCP

INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO ELECTED UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. THE

FAIR VALUE OF ABCP INVESTMENTS PURCHASED UNDER THE AML FACILITY FOR U.S. MONEY MARKET MUTUAL

FUNDS IS DETERMINED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AND IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE

TO BORROW UNDER THE PRIMARY CREDIT PROGRAM. THE TAF ALLOWS ALL ELIGIBLE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO PLACE A BID FOR AN ADVANCE FROM ITS LOCAL FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AT AN INTEREST

RATE SET BY AN AUCTION. ALL ADVANCES ARE REQUIRED TO BE FULLY COLLATERALIZED. THE TAF IS

DESIGNED TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR SOUND INSTITUTIONS TO BORROW WHEN THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WERE 3.52% AND 4.25% AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE

AND CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF ITS DEBT ISSUES. THE USE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT. THE MODIFIED

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WERE 1.86% AND 3.70% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 23  PREFERRED STOCK

JPMORGAN CHASE IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE 200 MILLION SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK, IN ONE OR MORE

SERIES, WITH A PAR VALUE OF $1 PER SHARE.

ON APRIL 23, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED 600,000 SHARES OF FIXED TO FLOATING RATE NONCUMULATIVE PREFERRED

STOCK, SERIES I (SERIES I), FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $6.0 BILLION.

ON JULY 15, 2008, EACH SERIES OF BEAR STEARNS PREFERRED STOCK THEN ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING WAS

EXCHANGED INTO A SERIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE PREFERRED STOCK (CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E,

SERIES F AND SERIES G) HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TERMS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXCHANGE, THESE

PREFERRED SHARES RANK EQUALLY WITH THE OTHER SERIES OF THE FIRMS PREFERRED STOCK.

ON AUGUST 21, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED 180,000 SHARES OF 8.625% NONCUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES

J (SERIES J), FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $1.8 BILLION.

ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, PURSUANT TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS (THE U.S. TREASURY)

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM (THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM), THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY,

FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION, (I) 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF THE FIRMS FIXED RATE CUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES K, PAR VALUE $1 PER SHARE AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE $10,000 PER

SHARE (THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK); AND (II) A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES OF

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE (THE WARRANT), SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN ANTI-DILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. THE $25.0 BILLION PROCEEDS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE

SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK AND THE WARRANT BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INITIAL CARRYING VALUE OF $23.7 BILLION ALLOCATED TO THE SERIES K PREFERRED

STOCK AND ITS REDEMPTION VALUE OF $25.0 BILLION WAS BEING AMORTIZED TO RETAINED EARNINGS (WITH A

CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK) OVER THE FIRST FIVE

YEARS OF THE CONTRACT AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DIVIDEND YIELD, USING THE EFFECTIVE-YIELD METHOD. THE

SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK WAS NONVOTING, QUALIFIED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL AND RANKED EQUALLY WITH THE

FIRMS OTHER SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK. ON JUNE 17, 2009, THE FIRM REDEEMED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK AND REPAID THE FULL $25.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TOGETHER WITH

ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS.

IN THE EVENT OF A LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION OF THE FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASES PREFERRED STOCK THEN

OUTSTANDING TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND THE

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS.

GENERALLY, DIVIDENDS ON SHARES OF OUTSTANDING SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY.

DIVIDENDS ON THE SHARES OF SERIES I PREFERRED STOCK ARE PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY AT A FIXED ANNUAL

DIVIDEND RATE OF 7.90% THROUGH APRIL 2018, AND THEN BECOME PAYABLE QUARTERLY AT AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND

RATE OF THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 3.47%. THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK BORE CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS,

PAYABLE QUARTERLY, AT A RATE OF 5% PER YEAR FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND 9% PER YEAR THEREAFTER.

DIVIDENDS COULD ONLY BE PAID IF, AS AND WHEN DECLARED BY THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE

EFFECTIVE DIVIDEND YIELD ON THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK WAS 6.16%. THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK

RANKED EQUALLY WITH THE FIRMS EXISTING 6.15% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E; 5.72%

CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES F; 5.49% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES G; FIXED-TO-FLOATING

RATE NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES I; AND 8.63% NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK, SERIES J, IN TERMS OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE FIRM.

MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE ITS

EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE,

DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE

10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT

AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 582 MILLION UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE, COMPENSATION, OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS,

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PLANS, AND THE WARRANTS ISSUED UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE.

NOTE 25  EARNINGS PER SHARE

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED NEW FASB GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPATING SECURITIES,

WHICH CLARIFIES THAT UNVESTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS CONTAINING NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO

DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS (COLLECTIVELY, DIVIDENDS) ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND

SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) CALCULATION USING THE TWO-CLASS METHOD.

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ENTITLE THE RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE NONFORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS DURING THE

VESTING PERIOD ON A BASIS EQUIVALENT TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK; THESE

UNVESTED AWARDS MEET THE DEFINITION OF PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD, ALL

EARNINGS (DISTRIBUTED AND UNDISTRIBUTED) ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH

CLASS OF COMMON STOCK AND PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE

DIVIDENDS. EPS DATA FOR THE PRIOR PERIODS WERE REVISED AS REQUIRED BY THE FASBS GUIDANCE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CALCULATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 27  INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL

TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME

TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR

LIABILITY FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS

TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES

EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE

MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY REPORTED.

THE COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE/(BENEFIT) INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

WERE AS FOLLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007.

TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES $280 MILLION, $55 MILLION AND $74 MILLION OF TAX BENEFITS

RECORDED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF TAX AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD

DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TABLE ALSO DOES NOT REFLECT THE CUMULATIVE TAX EFFECTS OF

INITIALLY IMPLEMENTING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN 2007. THE TAX EFFECT OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED

DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY RESULTED IN A DECREASE OF $3.7 BILLION IN 2009 AND AN INCREASE IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $3.0 BILLION AND $159 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD

OF TIME. DURING 2008, AS PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND

STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, FOR WHICH U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAD BEEN PROVIDED,

WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND THE CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES. AS

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS

U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THIS

DETERMINATION RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF AN INCOME

TAX BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. FOR 2009, PRETAX EARNINGS

OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION WERE GENERATED THAT WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE

SUBSIDIARIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS IN THESE

SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $15.7 BILLION. IF THE FIRM WERE TO RECORD A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT WOULD BE $3.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009.

THE TAX EXPENSE APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $427

MILLION, $608 MILLION, AND $60 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY U.S. INCOME TAX RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $912 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN

CONNECTION WITH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$4.4 BILLION AND THE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WAS $768 MILLION.

IF NOT

UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL EXPIRE IN 2027 AND THE STATE

AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WILL EXPIRE IN YEARS 2026, 2027 AND 2028. THE NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD HAS AN UNLIMITED CARRYFORWARD PERIOD.

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND

CERTAIN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS, AND CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL TAX BENEFITS. THE INCREASE IN THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE FROM 2008 WAS PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, JPMORGAN CHASES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES, WERE $6.6 BILLION, $5.9 BILLION AND $4.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

WHICH $3.5 BILLION, $2.9 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE THE

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS JPMORGAN CHASE IS PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAX

AUTHORITIES, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT JPMORGAN CHASES QUARTERLY AND

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATES.

PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, IN ADDITION TO THE

FIRMS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WAS $2.4 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

FOR INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF WHICH THE PENALTY COMPONENT WAS INSIGNIFICANT.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES OF THE VARIOUS

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AND NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS. THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE PRESENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION

BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FOR THE YEARS 2003, 2004 AND 2005. THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS OF BEAR STEARNS FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2003, 2004 AND 2005, ARE ALSO

UNDER EXAMINATION. BOTH EXAMINATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE IN 2010.

THE IRS AUDITS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS OF JPMORGAN CHASE FOR THE YEARS 2006,

NOTE 28  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.) IS

SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE

BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, AND ITS DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE

BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS

APPROXIMATELY $821 MILLION AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED

LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS

TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH

LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND

INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY

ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE

BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE

IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2010 AND 2009, JPMORGAN CHASES BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$3.6 BILLION AND $17.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY

DIVIDENDS IN 2010 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $24.0 BILLION AND $34.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $10.2 BILLION AND $23.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED

IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 29  CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA,

N.A.

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL

INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER

1, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY

CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF

TIER 1 AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ADJUSTED ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE

TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION. BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE

WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

ON JANUARY 1, 2010 THE FIRM ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, WHICH REQUIRED THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, BANK-ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATION VIES. AT

ADOPTION, THE FIRM ADDED APPROXIMATELY $88 BILLION OF U.S. GAAP ASSETS AND DECREASED THE TIER

1 CAPITAL RATIO BY APPROXIMATELY 30 BASIS POINTS. THE IMPACT TO THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO

PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $7

BILLION (PRETAX) RELATED TO THE RECEIVABLES HELD IN THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT

WERE CONSOLIDATED AT THE ADOPTION DATE. THE IMPACT TO THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO DOES NOT

INCLUDE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS THAT CHANGED THE REGULATORY TREATMENT FOR

CONSOLIDATED ABCP CONDUITS, SINCE THE FIRM ELECTED THE OPTIONAL TWO-QUARTER IMPLEMENTATION

DELAY, WHICH MAY BE FOLLOWED BY A TWO-QUARTER PARTIAL (50%) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EFFECT ON

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTITIES WHERE THE FIRM HAS NOT

PROVIDED IMPLICIT OR VOLUNTARY SUPPORT. AS A RESULT OF THE ELECTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

DELAY AS WELL AS CERTAIN ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 THAT

RESULTED IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE FIRMS

PRIMARY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST) WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION OF

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, THE U.S. GAAP CONSOLIDATION OF THESE ENTITIES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AT THE ADOPTION DATE.

(E)

THE FEDERAL RESERVE GRANTED THE FIRM, FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER, RELIEF UP TO A CERTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNT, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS FROM THE

FEDERAL RESERVES RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, WITH RESPECT TO BEAR STEARNS

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OTHER EXPOSURES ACQUIRED. THE OCC GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

SIMILAR RELIEF FROM ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. THE RELIEF WOULD HAVE

ENDED, BY ITS TERMS, ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2009. COMMENCING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM NO LONGER

ADJUSTED ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RELIEF IN THE CALCULATION OF

ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF JUNE 30, 2009.

LIABILITIES, WHICH HAVE RESULTED FROM BOTH NONTAXABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND FROM

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 30  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WERE OBLIGATED UNDER A NUMBER OF

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT USED PRIMARILY FOR BANKING PURPOSES, AND

FOR ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING SERVICE AGREEMENTS. CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS OR ESCALATION

CLAUSES PROVIDING FOR INCREASED RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON MAINTENANCE, UTILITY AND TAX INCREASES, OR

THEY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PERFORM RESTORATION WORK ON LEASED PREMISES. NO LEASE AGREEMENT IMPOSES

RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ENGAGE IN DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS OR ENTER INTO FURTHER LEASE AGREEMENTS.

IN 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED WITH THE IRS ISSUES RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING AND

WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN ACCOUNTS TRANSFERRED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON

CORPORATION (BNYM) IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS SALE TO BNYM OF ITS CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS.

THE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

LITIGATION RESERVE

THE FIRM MAINTAINS LITIGATION RESERVES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OUTSTANDING LITIGATION. JPMORGAN CHASE

ACCRUES FOR A LITIGATION-RELATED LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH A LIABILITY HAS BEEN

INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WHEN THE FIRM IS NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN A LITIGATION AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, AND A JUDGMENT-SHARING

AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS NET OF AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE

PAID BY OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE JUDGMENT-SHARING AGREEMENT.

WHILE THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, IN LIGHT OF ALL

INFORMATION KNOWN TO IT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRMS LITIGATION RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE AT SUCH

DATE. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS LITIGATION RESERVES AT LEAST QUARTERLY, AND THE RESERVES MAY BE INCREASED

OR DECREASED IN THE FUTURE TO REFLECT FURTHER RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LITIGATION AND,

WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LITIGATION, INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY, LITIGATING OR

SETTLING CASES ACCORDING TO MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE STOCKHOLDERS.

NOTE 31  OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER

COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN THE

COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTIES

SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED

TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN WHOLESALE-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 196198 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME

EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE

FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE

PRODUCTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL THESE LINES OF CREDIT BY

PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

TO NEW INVESTORS. THE AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS RELATED TO VARIABLE-RATE DEMAND BONDS AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER OF U.S. DOMESTIC STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES, HOSPITALS AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES WAS $23.3

BILLION AND $23.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SIMILAR COMMITMENTS EXIST TO

EXTEND CREDIT IN THE FORM OF LIQUIDITY FACILITY AGREEMENTS WITH NONCONSOLIDATED MUNICIPAL BOND

VIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 206-214 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE COMMITMENTS TO INVESTMENT- AND

NONINVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH LEVERAGED ACQUISITIONS. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THE ACQUISITION BY THE BORROWER IS SUCCESSFUL, TEND TO BE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE

AND, IN MOST CASES, ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS BASED ON THE BORROWERS FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS OF COMMITMENTS RELATED TO LEVERAGED ACQUISITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008, WERE $2.9 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 3 AND

NOTE 4 ON PAGES 148-165 AND 165-167 RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. THE CARRYING VALUES OF STANDBY AND OTHER LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE $920

MILLION AND $673 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS CLASSIFIED IN

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT

MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT

OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON EXERCISE BY THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED

PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT OPTION CONTRACTS IN

ORDER TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY

FIVE YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTS SUCH AS STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES

THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK

VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN

BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES, COMMONLY REFERRED

TO AS STABLE VALUE WRAPS, ARE TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO REALIZE INVESTMENT

RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO AND ARE TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM OR MAY

HAVE NO STATED MATURITY, BUT ALLOW THE FIRM TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING

ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO

BE GUARANTEES

WAS $87.2 BILLION AND $83.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE

NOTIONAL VALUE GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS

GUARANTEES, ALTHOUGH EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS REFLECTS THE

PROBABILITY OF WHETHER THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FAIR VALUE

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WERE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF $219 MILLION AND $184 MILLION AND

DERIVATIVE PAYABLES OF $981 MILLION AND $5.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS, OR BY

ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES.

IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE, THE FIRM IS BOTH

A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGES 167-175 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

THROUGH THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND

NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO

232

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM PROVIDES AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING

AGREEMENTS WHICH PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE THIRD-PARTY BORROWER TO RETURN THE

LENT SECURITIES IN THE EVENT THE FIRM DID NOT OBTAIN SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL. TO MINIMIZE ITS

LIABILITY UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID

COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE

BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE.

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL MAY BE

RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS, THE FIRM

WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE

LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF.

ALSO, AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM INVESTS CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED GUIDELINES.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A

CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY

INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE

IN LIEU OF MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO

INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (SOFTWARE

LICENSEES) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS),

PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY

OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY

INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD

REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE

FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE

RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

INDEMNIFICATIONS FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, AS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13 AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 192196 AND 198205, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT,

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAKES

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN ITS LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS THAT THE LOANS SOLD

MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM (INCLUDING IN ITS ROLES AS A

SERVICER) TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO

ANY BREACHES OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES UNDER THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SUCH LOANS HELD BY PURCHASERS, INCLUDING

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES, THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFECTS PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM HAD RECORDED REPURCHASE

LIABILITIES OF $1.7 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

REPURCHASE LIABILITIES ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT JPMORGAN CHASE WILL HAVE TO

PERFORM UNDER THESE  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND IS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE

AT THE REPORTING DATE. THE ESTIMATE INCORPORATES BOTH PRESENTED

DEMANDS AND PROBABLE FUTURE DEMANDS AND IS THE PRODUCT OF AN

ESTIMATED CURE RATE, AN ESTIMATED LOSS SEVERITY AND AN ESTIMATED

RECOVERY RATE FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHERE APPLICABLE. THE LIABILITIES

HAVE BEEN REPORTED NET OF PROBABLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD-PARTIES AND

PREDOMINATELY AS A REDUCTION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM SETTLED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS FOR

CERTAIN LOANS ORIGINATED AND SOLD BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK.

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A

RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS

THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE

SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS

FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON RECOURSE SERVICING

PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE

LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE LOAN AND THE

COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE FIRMS SECURITIZATIONS ARE

PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE

PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE

UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE TOTALED $13.5 BILLION AND $15.0 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM HAS RECORDED, WHICH IS

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD IT WILL HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER THIS GUARANTEE,

WAS $271 MILLION AND $241 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1, 2008, THE FIRM WAS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT VENTURE OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC

(THE JOINT VENTURE). THE JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 2005, AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT BY

THE FIRM AND FIRST DATA CORPORATION, ITS JOINT VENTURE PARTNER, TO INTEGRATE THE COMPANIES JOINTLY

OWNED CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND PAYMENTECH MERCHANT BUSINESSES. THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDED

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE

WAS COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2008, AND JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE BUSINESS

UNDER THE CHASE PAYMENTECH NAME.

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS

LIABLE PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT

OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS

FAVOR, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBERS ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO

THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF CHASE PAYMENTECH IS UNABLE

TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT

CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. CHASE PAYMENTECH MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE

SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE

UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES

OR A REFUND; (2) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND (3) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

233

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TRANSACTION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT

LOSSES OF $11 MILLION ON $409.7 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IT

HELD $213 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED

AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $13 MILLION ON $713.9 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, IT HELD $222 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY CHASE PAYMENTECH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS CHARGE

BACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAYMENT OR PERFORMANCE RISK TO THE FIRM

IS IMMATERIAL.

CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATION, EXCHANGE AND CLEARINGHOUSE GUARANTEES

THE FIRM HOLDS AN EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC. DURING OCTOBER 2007, CERTAIN VISA-RELATED ENTITIES

COMPLETED A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS TO COMBINE THEIR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING VISA USA,

UNDER ONE HOLDING COMPANY, VISA INC. UPON THE RESTRUCTURING, THE FIRMS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN VISA

USA WAS CONVERTED INTO AN EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC. VISA INC. SOLD SHARES VIA AN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING AND USED A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING TO REDEEM A PORTION OF THE FIRMS

EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC. PRIOR TO THE RESTRUCTURING, VISA USAS BY-LAWS OBLIGATED THE FIRM UPON

DEMAND BY VISA USA TO INDEMNIFY VISA USA FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION OBLIGATIONS OF VISA

USA. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT GUARANTEE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION AT FAIR VALUE. UPON

THE RESTRUCTURING EVENT, THE FIRMS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY VISA INC. WAS LIMITED TO CERTAIN

IDENTIFIED LITIGATIONS. SUCH A LIMITATION IS DEEMED A MODIFICATION OF THE INDEMNITY BY-LAW AND,

ACCORDINGLY, BECAME SUBJECT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION AT FAIR VALUE. THE VALUE OF THE LITIGATION

GUARANTEE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON ITS THEN FAIR VALUE; THE

NET AMOUNT RECORDED (WITHIN OTHER LIABILITIES) DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO VISA, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF OTHER ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING

SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF

THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH

OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO

DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS

CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTEE FUND, OR, IN A FEW CASES, THE OBLIGATION MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS

WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET

OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE

REMOTE.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE FIRM SUCCEEDED TO AN OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENT

FOR THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 383 MADISON AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY (THE SYNTHETIC LEASE). UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE SYNTHETIC LEASE, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PERIODIC PAYMENTS BASED ON THE LESSORS

UNDERLYING INTEREST COSTS. THE SYNTHETIC LEASE EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 1, 2010. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SYNTHETIC LEASE, THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE

BUILDING FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE THEN

OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS OF THE LESSOR, OR TO ARRANGE FOR THE SALE OF THE BUILDING, WITH THE

PROCEEDS OF THE SALE TO BE USED TO SATISFY THE LESSORS DEBT OBLIGATION. IF THE SALE DOES NOT

GENERATE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS TO SATISFY THE LESSORS DEBT OBLIGATION, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO FUND

THE SHORTFALL, UP TO A MAXIMUM RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS NO

EXPECTED SHORTFALL AND THE MAXIMUM RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WAS APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION.

NOTE 32  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES

THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS

SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS

NEEDED TO REFLECT MANAGEMENTS RISK TOLERANCE.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND

GEOGRAPHIC REGION, AND MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN

SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATION, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO,

CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A KEY FOCUS

ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL RISK CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE

REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY PARTICULAR LOAN PRODUCT (E.G., OPTION ARMS),

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT (E.G., COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE) OR ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN

PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND

ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ON-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS BY MAJOR PRODUCT AND

GEOGRAPHY, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 192-196 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

CONCENTRATIONS OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY MAJOR PRODUCT, SEE

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL

FROM THE FDIC FOR $1.9 BILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED EXCEEDED THE

PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE, SUCH AS PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST

THAT NEGATIVE GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER WRITING DOWN NONFINANCIAL

ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN.

(E)

INCLUDED A $1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM WASHINGTON MUTUALS LOAN LOSS RESERVE TO JPMORGAN

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD LOANS

FROM THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY WASHINGTON

MUTUAL (THE TRUST). AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT QUALITY CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK

RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE

OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO

THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 200 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(G)

MANAGED RESULTS FOR CREDIT CARD EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON TOTAL

NET REVENUE, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AVERAGE ASSETS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD

RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN EVALUATING THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF

THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO AS OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED, AND DECISIONS ARE MADE

ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED ON MANAGED INFORMATION. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE ELIMINATED IN RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP

RESULTS. THE RELATED SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS

(FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. BASED ON RULES FROM THE

FFIEC, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE ALLOCATED TO A COUNTRY BASED ON THE

DOMICILE OF THE COUNTERPARTY. ADDITIONALLY, LOCAL FOREIGN OFFICE COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN

COMMITMENTS; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE EXCLUDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN

EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

SEC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC METHODOLOGIES ARE: THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES; NET LOCAL COUNTRY ASSETS ARE REDUCED

BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION); AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTERPARTY, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY

COLLATERAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES EMERGING MARKETS CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE, SEE EMERGING MARKETS

CONDITIONS IN 2007 THROUGH 2009, PRIMARILY WITHIN CONSUMER LENDING, RESULTED IN INCREASING

LOSSES AND CORRESPONDINGLY HIGHER LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS. FOR A MORE DETAILED
