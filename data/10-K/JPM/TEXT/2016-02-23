the firm) a financial holding company incorporated under delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the united states of america (u.s.), with operations worldwide; the firm had $2.4 trillion in assets and $247.6 billion in stockholders equity as of december31, 2015. the firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. under the j.p. morgan and chase brands, the firm serves millions of customers in the u.s. and many of the worlds most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients.jpmorgan chases principal bank subsidiaries are jpmorgan chase bank, national association (jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.), a national banking association with u.s. branches in 23 states, and chase bank usa, national association (chase bank usa, n.a.), a national banking association that is the firms credit card-issuing bank. jpmorgan chases principal nonbank subsidiary is j.p. morgan securities llc (jpmorgan securities), the firms u.s. investment banking firm. the bank and nonbank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. one of the firms principal operating subsidiaries in the united kingdom (u.k.) is j.p. morgan securities plc, a subsidiary of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.the firms website is www.jpmorganchase.com. jpmorgan chase makes available free of charge, through its website, annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the sec). the firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a code of conduct for all employees of the firm and a code of ethics for its chairman and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer and all other professionals of the firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, tax or investor relations role.business segmentsjpmorgan chases activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a corporate segment. the firms consumer business is the consumer & community banking (ccb) segment. the firms wholesale business segments are corporate & investment bank (cib), commercial banking (cb), and asset management (am).a description of the firms business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the business segment results section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a), beginning on page 68 and in note 33.competitionjpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly competitive environment. competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. the firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. with respect to some of its geographies and products, jpmorgan chase competes globally; with respect to others, the firm competes on a national or regional basis. the firms ability to compete also depends on its ability to attract and retain professional and other personnel, and on its reputation.it is likely that competition in the financial services industry will become even more intense as the firms businesses continue to compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the firm, or with companies that provide new or innovative products or services that the firm is unable to provide.supervision and regulationthe firm is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the u.s., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the u.s. in which the firm does business.as a result of regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in the u.s. and abroad, the firm has been experiencing a period of significant change in regulation which has had and could continue to have significant consequences for how the firm conducts business. the firm continues to work diligently in assessing the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to comply with all the new regulations, while, at the same time, endeavoring to best meet the needs and expectations of its customers, clients and shareholders. these efforts include the implementation of new policies, procedures and controls, and appropriate adjustments to the firms business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity 1part imanagement. the combined effect of numerous rule-makings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to the firms business and operations. given the current status of the regulatory developments, the firm cannot currently quantify all of the possible effects on its business and operations of the significant changes that are underway. for more information, see risk factors on pages 818.financial holding company:consolidated supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the federal reserve). as a bank holding company (bhc) and a financial holding company, jpmorgan chase is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the federal reserve. the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator and certain of jpmorgan chases subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries. for example, jpmorgan chases national bank subsidiaries, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., and chase bank usa, n.a., are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) and, with respect to certain matters, by the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation (the fdic). certain non-bank subsidiaries, such as the firms u.s. broker-dealers, are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec, and subsidiaries of the firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the commodity futures trading commission (cftc). see securities and broker-dealer regulation, investment management regulation and derivatives regulation below. in addition, the firms consumer activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) and to regulation under various state statutes which are enforced by the respective states attorney general.scope of permissible business activities. the bank holding company act generally restricts bhcs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. financial holding companies generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for bhcs, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. the federal reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding companys ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible if the financial holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements (including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its u.s. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as well-capitalized and well-managed). the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. federal regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act, the federal reserve must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies. in addition, a financial holding company must obtain federal reserve approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the u.s. and internationally, as further described under regulation of acquisitions below.activities restrictions under the volcker rule. section 619 of the wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) (the volcker rule) prohibits banking entities, including the firm, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. in addition, the volcker rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined by the volcker rule) and imposes limits on certain transactions between the firm and its sponsored funds (see jpmorgan chases subsidiary banks  restrictions on transactions with affiliates below). the volcker rule, which became effective in july 2015, requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the volcker rule, including, in order to distinguish permissible from impermissible risk-taking activities, the measurement, monitoring and reporting of certain key metrics. given the uncertainty and complexity of the volcker rules framework, the full impact of the volcker rule will ultimately depend on its ongoing interpretation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight. capital and liquidity requirements. the federal reserve establishes capital and leverage requirements for the firm and evaluates its compliance with such requirements. the occ establishes similar capital and leverage requirements for the firms national banking subsidiaries. for more information about the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital and leverage in the u.s. under the most recent capital framework established by the basel committee on banking supervision (the basel committee)(basel iii), see capital management on pages 149158 and note 28. under basel iii, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and the net stable funding ratio (nsfr). the u.s. banking regulators have approved the final lcr rule (u.s. lcr), which became effective on january 1, 2015. a proposed u.s. rule for nsfr is expected. for additional information on these ratios, see liquidity risk management on pages 159164. it is likely that the banking supervisors will continue to refine and enhance the basel iii capital framework for financial institutions. the basel committee recently finalized revisions to market risk capital for trading books; other proposals being contemplated by the basel committee include revisions to, among others, standardized credit and operational risk capital frameworks and revisions 2to the securitization framework. after a proposal is finalized by the basel committee, u.s. banking regulators would then need to propose requirements applicable to u.s. financial institutions.stress tests. the federal reserve has adopted supervisory stress tests for large bank holding companies, including jpmorgan chase, which form part of the federal reserves annual comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) framework. under the framework, the firm must conduct semi-annual company-run stress tests and, in addition, must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the firm and the federal reserve. in reviewing the firms capital plan, the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. qualitative assessments include (among other things) the comprehensiveness of the plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the firm has satisfied certain supervisory matters related to the firms processes and analyses, including the design and operational effectiveness of the controls governing such processes. moreover, the firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the federal reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. the occ requires jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. to perform separate, similar annual stress tests. the firm publishes each year the results of its mid-cycle stress tests under the firms internally-developed severely adverse scenario and the results of its (and its two primary subsidiary banks) annual stress tests under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal reserve and the occ. commencing with the 2016 ccar, the annual ccar submission will be due on april 5. results will be published by the federal reserve by june 30, with disclosures of results by bhcs, including the firm, to follow within 15 days. also commencing in 2016, the mid-cycle capital stress test submissions will be due on october 5 and bhcs, including the firm, will publish results by november 4. the federal reserve has indicated that it is currently evaluating the inclusion of all or partof the global systemically important bank (gsib) surcharge into the 2017 ccar test and the firm is currently awaiting further guidance. for additional information on the firms ccar, see capital management on pages 149158.enhanced prudential standards. the financial stability oversight council (fsoc), among other things, recommends prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements to the federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions, such as jpmorgan chase. the federal reserve has adopted several rules to implement the heightened prudential standards, including final rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject bhcs. bhcs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and their board of directors is required to conduct appropriate oversight of their risk management activities. for information on liquidity measures, see liquidity risk management on pages 159164. several additional proposed rules are still being considered, including rules relating to single-counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses.risk reporting. in january 2013, the basel committee issued new regulations relating to risk aggregation and reporting. under these regulations, the banking institutions risk governance framework must encompass risk-data aggregation and reporting, and data aggregation must be highly automated and allow for minimal manual intervention. the regulations also impose higher standards for the accuracy, comprehensiveness, granularity and timely distribution of data reporting, and call for regular supervisory review of the banking institutions risk aggregation and reporting. these new standards became effective for gsibs, including the firm, on january 1, 2016.orderly liquidation authority and resolution and recovery. as a bhc with assets of $50 billion or more, the firm is required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan for resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). the fdic also requires each insured depositary institution with $50 billion or more in assets, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a., to provide a resolution plan. for more information about the firms resolution plan, see risk factors on pages 818. in addition, certain financial companies, including jpmorgan chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. the u.s. treasury secretary, in consultation with the president of the united states, must first make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations, and action must be recommended by the fdic and the federal reserve. absent such actions, the firm, as a bhc, would remain subject to resolution under the bankruptcy code. in december 2013, the fdic issued a draft policy statement describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of systemically important financial institutions under the orderly liquidation authority. this strategy seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of the bhc open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. the firm has a comprehensive recovery plan detailing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. jpmorgan chase has provided the federal reserve with comprehensive confidential supervisory information and analyses about the firms businesses, legal entities and corporate governance and about its crisis management governance, capabilities and available alternatives to raise liquidity and capital in severe market circumstances. the 3part iocc has published for comment proposed guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, including jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a.regulators in the u.s. and abroad continue to be focused on developing measures designed to address the possibility or perception that large financial institutions, including the firm, may be too big to fail, and to provide safeguards so that, if a large financial institution does fail, it can be resolved without the use of public funds. higher capital surcharges on gsibs, requirements for certain large bank holding companies to maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt to facilitate orderly resolution of those firms, and the international swaps and derivatives association (isda) protocol relating to the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution, are examples of initiatives to address too big to fail. for further information on the potential impact of the gsib framework and total loss absorbing capacity (tlac), see capital management on pages 149158 and risk factors on pages 818, and on the isda close-out protocol, see derivatives regulation below.holding company as source of strength for bank subsidiaries. jpmorgan chase & co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries. this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when the firm might otherwise determine not to provide it.regulation of acquisitions. acquisitions by bank holding companies and their banks are subject to multiple requirements by the federal reserve and the occ. for example, financial holding companies and bank holding companies are required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. in addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. in contrast, because the liabilities of non-u.s. financial companies are calculated differently under this rule, a non-u.s. financial company could hold significantly more than 10% of the u.s. market without exceeding the concentration limit. in addition, for certain acquisitions, the firm must provide written notice to the federal reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature.jpmorgan chases subsidiary banks:the firms two primary subsidiary banks, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a., are fdic-insured national banks regulated by the occ. as national banks, the activities of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a. are limited to those specifically authorized under the national bank act and related interpretations by the occ. fdic deposit insurance. the fdic deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which is funded through assessments on banks, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a. changes in the methodology used to calculate such assessments, resulting from the enactment of the dodd-frank act, significantly increased the assessments that the firms bank subsidiaries pay annually to the fdic. in october 2015, the fdic proposed a new assessment surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion in order to raise the reserve ratio for the fdic deposit insurance fund. future fdic rule-making could further increase such assessments. fdic powers upon a bank insolvency. upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., the fdic may be appointed as the conservator or receiver under the federal deposit insurance act (fdia). in addition, where a systemically important financial institution, such as jpmorgan chase & co., is in default or in danger of default, the fdic may be appointed as receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation. in both cases, the fdic has broad powers to transfer any assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors. cross-guarantee. an fdic-insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic if another fdic-insured institution that is under common control with such institution is in default or is deemed to be in danger of default (commonly referred to as cross-guarantee liability). an fdic cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution. prompt corrective action and early remediation. the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. while these regulations apply only to banks, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a., the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent bhc, such as jpmorgan chase & co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. in certain instances, the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. occ heightened standards. the occ has issued final regulations and guidelines establishing heightened standards for large banks. the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. while the bank may use certain components of the parent companys risk governance framework, the framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from the parent for risk management purposes. the banks board or risk committee is responsible for approving the 4banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. restrictions on transactions with affiliates. the bank subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase (including subsidiaries of those banks) are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, jpmorgan chase & co. and certain other affiliates. these restrictions prevent jpmorgan chase & co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. for more information, see note 27. in addition, the volcker rule imposes a prohibition on such transactions between any jpmorgan chase entity and covered funds for which a jpmorgan chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as, subject to a limited exception, any covered fund controlled by such funds. dividend restrictions. federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a. see note 27 for the amount of dividends that the firms principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at january 1, 2016, to their respective bank holding companies without the approval of their banking regulators. in addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the occ and the federal reserve have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of the bank subsidiaries they supervise, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. depositor preference. under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of u.s. deposit liabilities (including the fdic) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders and depositors in non-u.s. offices. as a result, such persons could receive substantially less than the depositors in u.s. offices of the depository institution. the u.k. prudential regulation authority (the pra), a subsidiary of the bank of england which has responsibility for prudential regulation of banks and other systemically important institutions, has issued a proposal that may require the firm to either obtain equal treatment for u.k. depositors or subsidiarize in the u.k. in september 2013, the fdic issued a final rule which clarifies that foreign deposits are considered deposits under the fdia if they are payable in the u.s. as well as in the foreign branch.cfpb regulation and supervision, and other consumer regulations. jpmorgan chase and its national bank subsidiaries, including jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chase bank usa, n.a., are subject to supervision and regulation by the cfpb with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. these laws include the truth-in-lending, equal credit opportunity (ecoa), fair credit reporting, fair debt collection practice, electronic funds transfer, credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure (card) and home mortgage disclosure acts. the cfpb also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. the cfpb has issued informal guidance on a variety of topics (such as the collection of consumer debts and credit card marketing practices) and has taken enforcement actions against certain financial institutions. much of the cfpbs initial rule-making efforts have addressed mortgage related topics, including ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, home mortgage disclosure act requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. other areas of recent focus include pre-authorized electronic funds transfers, add-on products, matters involving consumer populations considered vulnerable by the cfpb (such as students), credit reporting, and the furnishing of credit scores to individuals. the cfpb has been focused on automobile dealer discretionary interest rate markups, and on holding the firm and other purchasers of such contracts (indirect lenders) responsible under the ecoa for statistical disparities in markups charged by the dealers to borrowers of different races or ethnicities. for information regarding a current investigation relating to indirect lending to automobile dealers, see note 31.securities and broker-dealer regulation:the firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the u.s. through j.p. morgan securities llc and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority and the new york stock exchange, among others. the firm conducts similar securities activities outside the u.s. subject to local regulatory requirements. in the u.k., those activities are conducted by j.p. morgan securities plc, which is regulated by the pra and by the financial conduct authority (fca), which regulates prudential matters for firms that are not so regulated by the pra and conduct matters for all market participants. broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers funds, the financing of clients purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. for information on the net capital of j.p. morgan securities llc and j.p. morgan clearing corp., and the applicable requirements relating to risk-based capital for j.p. morgan securities plc, see broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 158. future rule-making under 5part ithe dodd-frank act and rules proposed by the department of labor may impose (among other things) a new standard of care applicable to broker-dealers when dealing with customers.investment management regulation:the firms investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and management of client funds. certain of the firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the sec as investment advisers. as such, the firms registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the investment advisers act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as various state securities laws. for information regarding investigations and litigation in connection with disclosures to clients related to proprietary products, see note 31.the firms asset management business continues to be affected by ongoing rule-making. in july 2013, the sec adopted amendments to rules that govern money-market funds, requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime money-market funds, effective october 14, 2016. as noted above, the department of labor has also proposed a rule that would significantly expand the universe of persons viewed as investment fiduciaries to retirement plans and iras. in addition, the sec has issued proposed rules regarding enhanced liquidity risk management for open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (etfs); restrictions on the use of derivatives by mutual funds, etfs and closed-end funds; and enhanced reporting for funds and advisors. derivatives regulation: the firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses. the regulations impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, require that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. in addition, the dodd-frank act requires the registration of swap dealers and major swap participants with the cftc and of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants with the sec. jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., j.p. morgan securities llc, j.p. morgan securities plc and j.p. morgan ventures energy corporation have registered with the cftc as swap dealers, and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., j.p. morgan securities llc and j.p. morgan securities plc will likely be required to register with the sec as security-based swap dealers. as a result of their registration as swap dealers or security-based swap dealers, these entities will be subject to a new, comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, which includes capital requirements, rules regulating their swap activities, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. further, some of the rules for derivatives apply extraterritorially to u.s. firms doing business with clients outside of the u.s., as well as to the overseas activities of non-u.s. subsidiaries of the firm that either deal with u.s. persons or that are guaranteed by u.s. subsidiaries of the firm; however, the full scope of the extra-territorial impact of the u.s. swaps regulation has not been finalized and therefore remains unclear. the effect of these rules may require banking entities, such as the firm, to modify the structure of their derivatives businesses and face increased operational and regulatory costs. in the european union (the eu), the implementation of the european market infrastructure regulation (emir) and the revision of the markets in financial instruments directive (mifid ii) will result in comparable, but not identical, changes to the european regulatory regime for derivatives. the combined effect of the u.s. and eu requirements, and the potential conflicts and inconsistencies between them, present challenges and risks to the structure and operating model of the firms derivatives businesses.in november 2015, the firm and other financial institutions agreed to adhere to an updated resolution stay protocol developed by isda in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. the resolution stay protocol provides for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights.in the u.s., two subsidiaries of the firm are registered as futures commission merchants, and other subsidiaries are either registered with the cftc as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors or exempt from such registration. these cftc-registered subsidiaries are also members of the national futures association. data regulation:the firm and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations concerning the use and protection of certain customer, employee and other personal and confidential information, including those imposed by the gramm-leach-bliley act and the fair credit reporting act, as well as the eu data protection directive. in addition, there are numerous proposals pending before u.s. and non-u.s. legislative and regulatory bodies regarding privacy and data protection. for example, the european parliament and the european council have reached agreement on certain data protection reforms proposed by the european commission which includes numerous operational requirements, adds a requirement to notify individuals of data breaches and establishes enhanced sanctions for non-compliance, including increased fines. 6the bank secrecy act and economic sanctions:the bank secrecy act (bsa) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. the bsa includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know your customer documentation requirements. in january 2013, the firm entered into consent orders with its banking regulators relating to the firms bank secrecy act/anti-money laundering policies, procedures and controls; the firm has taken significant steps to modify and enhance its processes and controls with respect to its anti-money laundering procedures and to remediate the issues identified in the consent order. the firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the u.s. treasurys office of foreign assets control (ofac).anti-corruption:the firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act. for more information on a current investigation relating to, among other things, the firms hiring of persons referred by government officials and clients, see note 31.compensation practices:the firms compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve, as well as other agencies. the federal reserve has issued guidance jointly with the fdic and the occ that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. in addition, under the dodd-frank act, federal regulators, including the federal reserve, must issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions, including the firm, to report the structure of all of their incentive-based compensation arrangements and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. the federal reserve has conducted a review of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large banking institutions, including the firm. in addition to the federal reserve, the financial stability board has established standards covering compensation principles for banks. in europe, the fourth capital requirements directive (crd iv) includes compensation provisions. in the u.k., compensation standards are governed by the remuneration code of the pra and the fca. the implementation of the federal reserves and other banking regulators guidelines regarding compensation are expected to evolve over the next several years, and may affect the manner in which the firm structures its compensation programs and practices.significant international regulatory initiatives:the eu operates a european systemic risk board which monitors financial stability, together with european supervisory agencies which set detailed regulatory rules and encourage supervisory convergence across the 28 member states. the eu has also created a single supervisory mechanism for the euro-zone, under which the regulation of all banks in that zone will be under the auspices of the european central bank, together with a single resolution mechanism and single resolution board, having jurisdiction over bank resolution in the zone. at both global and eu levels, various proposals are under consideration to address risks associated with global financial institutions. some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries.in the eu, there is an extensive and complex program of final and proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects, in part, the eus commitments to policies of the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors (g-20) together with other plans specific to the eu. this program includes emir, which requires, among other things, the central clearing of standardized derivatives; and mifid ii, which gives effect to the g-20 commitment to trading of derivatives through central clearing houses and exchanges and also includes significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency and a significant reconfiguration of the regulatory supervision of execution venues.the eu is also currently considering or implementing significant revisions to laws covering: depositary activities; credit rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; corporate governance in financial firms; and implementation in the eu of the basel iii capital and liquidity standards.following the issuance of the report of the high level expert group on reforming the structure of the eu banking sector (the liikanen group), the eu has proposed legislation providing for a proprietary trading ban and mandatory separation of other trading activities within certain banks, while various eu member states have separately enacted similar measures. in the u.k., legislation was adopted that mandates the separation (or ring-fencing) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. the legislation includes the supplemental recommendation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards (the tyrie commission) that such ring-fences should be electrified by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. parallel but distinct provisions have been enacted by the french, belgian and german governments. these measures may separately or taken together have significant implications for the firms organizational 7part istructure in europe, as well as its permitted activities and capital deployment in the eu.u.k. regulators are introducing a range of policy measures that make significant changes to the regulatory environment in the u.k. alongside broader recommendations made by the fair and effective markets review which focused on fixed income currencies and commodities markets, there is a focus by u.k. regulators on raising standards and accountability of individuals, and promoting forward-looking conduct risk identification and mitigation, including by introducing the new senior managers and certification regimes. item 1a: risk factorsthe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chases financial condition and operations. readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm.regulatory riskjpmorgan chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the firms businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the firm is subject.as a global financial services firm, jpmorgan chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the u.s. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the u.s. in which the firm does business. the financial services industry has experienced and continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the u.s. and globally, and the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the firms business, operations and profitability remains uncertain.the recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the u.s. and in the other countries in which the firm operates, and any required changes to the firms business or operations resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the firm, impose additional compliance and other costs on the firm or otherwise reduce the firms profitability, limit the products and services that the firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the firm holds, require the firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the firms businesses. in addition, to the extent that legislative or regulatory initiatives are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the firm to restructure its businesses, or re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way.in addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the u.s. and in different countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business. for example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the eu, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, conduct of business requirements, restrictions on compensation and governance and accountability regimes, could require the firm to make significant modifications to its non-u.s. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. these differences in implemented or proposed non-u.s. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the u.s., which could subject the firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the firms business, results of operations and profitability.expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of jpmorgan chases businesses may continue to increase the firms costs and risks.the firms businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. the firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. the firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the firms operational and compliance costs.certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects.in addition, u.s. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions, such as the firms agreement in may 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. such resolutions, whether with u.s. or non-u.s. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the 8forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators). the firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action.in addition, if the firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. the extent of the firms exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the firm has established for such matters.requirements for the orderly resolution of the firm could require jpmorgan chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses, and holders of jpmorgan chases debt and equity securities would be at risk of absorbing losses if the firm were to enter into a resolution.under title i of the dodd-frank act (title i) and federal reserve and fdic rules, the firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase & co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the u.s. bankruptcy code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. in august 2014, the federal reserve and the fdic announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of title i resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations in 2013, including the firm. the agencies jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the firms 2013 plan. the fdics board of directors determined under title i that the 2013 resolution plans, including the firms 2013 plan, were not credible and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the u.s. bankruptcy code. the federal reserve board determined that the eleven banking organizations must take immediate actions to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. the firm has devoted significant resources to its resolution planning efforts, and believes that in its most recent title i resolution plan submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in july 2015, it has addressed, or has made substantial progress in addressing, each of the shortcomings previously identified by the agencies.however, if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that the firms 2015 plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the firm, and could, if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination, require the firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the firms operations and strategy. in addition, in order to develop a title i resolution plan that the federal reserve and fdic determine is credible, the firm may need to make certain changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs.in addition to the firms plan for orderly resolution, the firms resolution plan also recommends to the federal reserve and the fdic its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the firm under the special resolution procedure provided in title ii of the dodd-frank act (title ii). the firms recommendation involves a single point of entry recapitalization model in which the fdic would use its power to create a bridge entity for jpmorgan chase; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the firms business, principally the stock of jpmorgan chase & co.s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries by, among other things, converting some or all of such intercompany claims to capital; and exchange external debt claims against jpmorgan chase & co. for equity in the bridge entity. as discussed below, the federal reserve has also proposed rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization of the bridge entity and operating subsidiaries (eligible ltd). if jpmorgan chase & co. were to enter into a resolution, either in a proceeding under the u.s. bankruptcy code or in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the dodd-frank act, holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the firm would be at risk of absorbing the losses of jpmorgan chase & co. and its affiliates. if jpmorgan chase & co. commenced proceedings under the u.s. bankruptcy code, creditors and shareholders of jpmorgan chase & co. would realize value only to the extent available to jpmorgan chase & co. as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and its other subsidiaries, after the payment to the creditors of such subsidiaries. in addition, even under the firms preferred resolution strategy under title ii of the dodd-frank act, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of the firms eligible ltd and other debt securities may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt. it is also possible that the application of the firms recommended title ii strategy could result in greater losses to security holders of jpmorgan chase & co. than the losses that would result from a different resolution strategy for the firm.9part imarket riskjpmorgan chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by u.s. and global financial market and economic conditions.jpmorgan chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates, currency and commodities prices (including oil prices) and other market indices; investor, consumer and business sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities; monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks; and the health of the u.s. and global economies. these conditions can affect the firms businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the firms clients and customers.in the firms underwriting and advisory businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the firm executes for its clients and customers and, therefore, the revenue that the firm receives, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the firm.the firm generally maintains market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. the revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the firms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions. certain of the firms market-making positions could be adversely affected by the lack of liquidity, which will be influenced by many of these factors, and which could affect the firms ability to realize returns from such activities and adversely affect the firms earnings.the firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values. this is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing third-party assets or receive or post collateral. for example, a higher level of u.s. or non-u.s. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the firms revenue. macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the firms funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue.changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the firms balance sheet and the revenue that the firm earns from net interest income. a low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (msr) asset, thereby reducing the firms net interest income and other revenues. conversely, increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs, lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the firms revenues and capital levels.the firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by u.s. domestic economic conditions, including u.s. interest rates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. if the recent positive trends in the u.s. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the firms consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. in addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment due to economic dislocations in certain geographies or industries caused by falling oil and gas prices or other market or economic factors, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the firms earnings.widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis, and may adversely affect the credit markets and the firms businesses. credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. changes in the firms credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the firms earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value. sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loans and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the firms profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the firms funding costs. sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the firm.credit riskthe financial condition of jpmorgan chases customers, clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the firm.the firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. many of these transactions expose the firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. the failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about a default by such an institution, could also 10lead to significant liquidity problems for, or losses or defaults by, other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect the firm. in addition, in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices, and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future.as part of providing clearing services, the firm is a member of a number of central counterparties (ccps), and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. as a clearing member, the firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. in addition, the firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to such clients. if a client for which the firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the firm may suffer losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more ccps, or the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. all of such events can increase the firms operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the firm is insufficient to cover such losses.during periods of market stress or illiquidity, the firms credit risk also may be further increased when the firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the firm. further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.jpmorgan chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. for example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the firms borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the firms credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses, including mark-to-market losses in its trading businesses. similarly, challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the firms borrowers or counterparties, not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located, or about the ability of customers of the firms consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the firm. as a result, the firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks. the firms efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful.in addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the firms inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. the inability to reduce the firms positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the firms balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the firms businesses.liquidity riskif jpmorgan chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.jpmorgan chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. some potential conditions that could impair the firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (spes) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, default by a ccp or other counterparty, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the firm or financial markets in general. these conditions may be caused by events over which the firm has little or no control. the widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the firms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future.if the firms access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. in addition, the firms cost of funding could be affected by actions that the firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, to lower its gsib systemic risk score or to satisfy the amount of eligible ltd that the firm must have outstanding under the final tlac rules.as a holding company, jpmorgan chase & co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. these payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. several of jpmorgan chase & co.s principal subsidiaries are 11part isubject to dividend distribution, capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. limitations in the payments that jpmorgan chase & co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations.proposed banking regulations relating to liquidity, including u.s. rules relating to total loss-absorbing capacity, could require jpmorgan chase to issue a substantial amount of new debt, and thereby significantly increase its funding costs.on october 30, 2015, the federal reserve issued proposed rules (the proposed tlac rules) that would require the top-tier holding companies of eight u.s. global systemically important bank holding companies (u.s. gsib bhcs), including jpmorgan chase & co., among other things, to maintain minimum amounts of eligible ltd, commencing january 1, 2019. the proposed tlac rules would disqualify from eligible ltd, among other instruments, senior debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as debt securities that are not governed by u.s. law and structured notes. the currently outstanding senior long-term debt of u.s. gsib bhcs, including jpmorgan chase & co., includes structured notes as well as other debt that typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default and, as a result, none of such outstanding senior long-term debt or any subsequently issued senior long-term debt with similar terms would qualify as eligible ltd under the proposed tlac rules. the federal reserve has requested comment on whether certain currently outstanding instruments should be allowed to count as eligible ltd despite containing features that would be prohibited under the proposal. the steps that the u.s. gsib bhcs, including jpmorgan chase & co., may need to take to come into compliance with the final tlac rules, including the amount and form of long-term debt that must be refinanced or issued, will depend in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior long-term debt and any grandfathering provisions. to the extent that outstanding senior long-term debt of jpmorgan chase & co. is not classified as eligible ltd under the tlac rule as finally adopted by the federal reserve, the firm could be required to issue a substantial amount of new senior long-term debt which could significantly increase the firms funding costs.authorities in some non-u.s. jurisdictions in which the firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. in addition, some non-u.s. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. these requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to increase capital or liquidity requirements that would be applicable to non-u.s. subsidiaries of the firm, could hinder the firms ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner.reductions in jpmorgan chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the firm.jpmorgan chase & co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support, and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. although the firm closely monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the firms credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the firms options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.furthermore, a reduction in the firms credit ratings could reduce the firms access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the firm, thereby curtailing the firms business operations and reducing its profitability. in addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase & co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that jpmorgan chase & co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future.legal riskjpmorgan chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the firm.jpmorgan chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. actions currently pending against the firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the firm, which could materially and adversely affect the firms business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious harm to the firms reputation. as a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.in addition, and as noted above, the firms businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the firm in the future. 12a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the u.s. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-u.s. jurisdictions. these and other initiatives from u.s. and non-u.s. governmental authorities and officials may subject the firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the firms reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the firms profitability, or result in collateral consequences as discussed above.other business risksjpmorgan chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the u.s. and around the world.jpmorgan chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various u.s. and non-u.s. regulatory authorities and agencies. the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the u.s. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the u.s. and the return earned on those loans and investments. changes in federal reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-u.s. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as pegging the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the firms control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the firms activities and results of operations.the firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. these risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.several of the firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, u.s. and non-u.s. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. these activities can expose the firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the firms financial condition and results of operations.further, various countries or regions in which the firm operates or invests, or in which the firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. low or volatile oil prices, coupled with the slowdown in the macroeconomic prospects in china, and concerns about economic weaknesses in the eurozone (including the permanent resolution of the greek bailout program), could continue to undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2016. in some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can causea contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to market contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the region. accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, may adversely affect the firm.jpmorgan chases operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.some of the countries in which jpmorgan chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the u.s. and other developed markets in which the firm currently operates. some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, low or negative growth, or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. in addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments; these development have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, crime and corruption, security and personal safety issues, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the firms operations or investments in such countries. political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations.less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the firms operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.13part irevenue from international operations and trading in non-u.s. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the firms operations and investments in another country or countries, including the firms operations in the u.s. as a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the firms business and results of operations.conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. there can be no assurance that the firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. in addition, the firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the u.s. to comply with u.s. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.jpmorgan chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such processes or systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the firms operations.jpmorgan chases businesses are dependent on the firms ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. the firms front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. if the firms financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operating systems of third parties on which the firms businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the firm could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, as the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions (and the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and financial intermediaries) increases, the risk of human and/or systems error in connection with such transactions increases, and it becomes more challenging to maintain the firms operational systems and infrastructure. the firm is similarly dependent on its employees. the firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the firms operations or systems. in addition, when the firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, the firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. any of these occurrences could diminish the firms ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), damage to reputation, impairment of liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm.third parties with which the firm does business, including retailers and other third parties with which the firms customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the firm, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the firms security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. as the firms interconnectivity with these third parties increases, the firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. security breaches affecting the firms customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the firm or its customers, thereby increasing the firms operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact the firms ability to conduct business.the firms businesses are subject to complex and evolving u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including clients, clients clients, employees of the firm and its suppliers and other third parties). ensuring that the firms collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can increase the firms operating costs, impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management, and may require the firm to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. furthermore, the firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third partieshave appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the firm, particularly where such information is transmitted by 14electronic means. if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions.concerns regarding the effectiveness of the firms measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the firms revenues. accordingly, any failure or perceived failure by the firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the firms reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.the firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the firms control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the firms property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. jpmorgan chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. while the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm or its customers and clients. any failures or disruptions of the firms systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the firms business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability, or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.a breach in the security of jpmorgan chases systems, or those of other market participants, could disrupt the firms businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the firm.although jpmorgan chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the firms security measures will provide absolute security. jpmorgan chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. the firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services.despite the firms efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the firm, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the firms systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the firms data or that of its customers or clients. these risks may increase in the future as the firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the firms systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the firm, including significant disruption of the firms operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the firms security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the firms reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the firm.risk managementjpmorgan chases framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the firm, thereby resulting in losses.jpmorgan chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the firm. the firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the firm is subject. however, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop 15part iin the future, risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. in addition, the firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures, and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the firms data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. any lapse in the firms risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the firms risk management framework, governance, procedures, practices, models or risk reporting systems could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the firm, materially and adversely affect the firms financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.the firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives and trading account assets, as well as the investment securities portfolio and cash management and clearing activities, expose the firm to credit risk. the firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. the firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending-related commitments. the firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. these processes are critical to the firms financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. as is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.jpmorgan chases market-making businesses may expose the firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the firm to suffer unexpected losses. severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. certain of the firms trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the firm does not own; if the firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the firms reputation and ability to transact future business. in addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. in particular, in addition, disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause the firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair the firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the firms risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. in such circumstances, it may be difficult for the firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations. many of the firms risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. for example, many models used by the firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. in times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. these sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the firms risk management strategies, causing the firm to incur losses.many of the models used by the firm are subject to review not only by the firms model risk function but also by the firms regulators in order that the firm may utilize such models in connection with the firms calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (rwa), credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under the advanced approach of basel iii. the firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators.in addition, the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm. these requirements apply to the firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the firm has been subject. the firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. failure by the firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could 16result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the firms regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the firms reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the firm.other risksthe financial services industry is highly competitive, and jpmorgan chases inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.jpmorgan chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the firm expects that competition in the u.s. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. competitors of the firm include other banks and financial institutions, trading, advisory and investment management firms, finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading and payment processing. new technologies have required and could require the firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. ongoing or increased competition, on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation, price or other factors, may put downward pressure on prices for the firms products and services or may cause the firm to lose market share. in addition, the failure of any of the firms businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance (relative to competitors or to benchmarks), could impact the firms ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers, thereby reducing the firms revenues. increased competition also may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. the firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.competitors of the firms non-u.s. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. the more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to u.s. financial services institutions, such as jpmorgan chase, can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-u.s. competitors, including prohibiting the firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the firm, making the firms pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the firms cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the firms wholesale businesses.jpmorgan chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.jpmorgan chases employees are the firms most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. the firm endeavors toattract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. the firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the firms operating committee, including the chief executive officer position, and senior positions below the operating committee. the firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. in addition, the firms board of directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the chief executive officer and the members of the operating committee. if for any reason the firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the chief executive officer or members of the operating committee, the firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.jpmorgan chases financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which, if incorrect, could result in unexpected losses in the future.under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap), jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. certain of the firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, instruments in the investment securities portfolio, certain loans, msrs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the firms financial statements. where quoted market prices are not available, the firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. in addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. if estimates or judgments underlying the firms financial statements are incorrect, the firm may experience material losses.lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the firms operations, profitability or reputation.there can be no assurance that the firms disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. any such lapses or deficiencies may materially 17part iand adversely affect the firms business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the firms reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.damage to jpmorgan chases reputation could damage its businesses.maintaining trust in jpmorgan chase is critical to the firms ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. damage to the firms reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the firms business and prospects. harm to the firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. the firms reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. in addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the appropriate standards, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the firms reputation. adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the firms prospects.management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the firms clients. the failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions and may do so in the future and could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the firm, as well as cause serious harm to the firms reputation.actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the firms reputation. for example, the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the firms reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the firms earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the firms reputation will not impair the firms ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees.item 1b: unresolved sec

of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934). based on that evaluation, the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. see exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the certification statements issued by the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer.the firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. in addition, in a firm as large and complex as jpmorgan chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future. for further information, see managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 174. there was no change in the firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended december31, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the firms internal control over financial reporting.item 9b: other informationpursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012, which added section 13(r) to the securities exchange

floor. see capital management on pages 149158 for additional information on basel iii.summary of 2015 resultsjpmorgan chase reported record full-year 2015 net income of $24.4 billion, and record earnings per share of $6.00, on net revenue of $93.5 billion. net income increased by $2.7 billion compared with net income of $21.7 billion in 2014. roe for the year was 11%, up from 10% in the prior year.the increase in net income in 2015 was driven by lower taxes and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses. the decline in net revenue was predominantly driven by lower corporate private equity gains, lower cib revenue reflecting the impact of business simplification, and lower ccb mortgage banking revenue. these decreases were partially offset by a benefit from a legal settlement in corporate and higher operating lease income, predominantly in ccb. the decrease in noninterest expense was driven by lower cib expense, reflecting the impact of business simplification, and lower ccb expense as a result of efficiencies, predominantly reflecting declines in headcount-related expense and lower professional fees, partially offset by investments in the business. as a result of these changes, the firms overhead ratio in 2015 was lower compared with the prior year. the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year as a result of an increase in the wholesale provision, reflecting the impact of downgrades, including in the oil & gas portfolio. the consumer provision declined, reflecting lower net charge-offs due to continued discipline in credit underwriting, as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment levels. this was partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses.total firmwide allowance for credit losses in 2015 was $14.3 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.37%, excluding the pci portfolio, compared with 1.55% in the prior year. the firms allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans, excluding the pci portfolio and credit card, was 117% compared with 106% in 2014. firmwide, net charge-offs were $4.1 billion for the year, down $673 million from 2014. nonperforming assets at year-end were $7.0 billion, down $933 million.the firms results reflected solid underlying performance across its four major reportable business segments, with continued strong lending and consumer deposit growth. firmwide average core loans increased by 12% compared with the prior year. within ccb, consumer & business banking average deposits increased 9% over the prior year. the firm had nearly 23 million active mobile customers at year end, an increase of 20% over the prior year. credit card sales volume (excluding commercial card) was up 7% for the year and merchant processing volume was up 12%. the cib maintained its #1 ranking in global investment banking fees according to dealogic. cb had record average loans, with an 11% increase compared with the prior year. cb also had record gross investment banking revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from the prior year. am had positive net long-term jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report69managements discussion and analysisclient inflows and continued to deliver strong investment performance with 80% of mutual fund assets under management (aum) ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartiles over the past five years. am also increased average loan balances by 8% in 2015. in 2015, the firm continued to adapt its strategy and financial architecture toward meeting regulatory and capital requirements and the changing banking landscape, while serving its clients and customers, investing in its businesses, and delivering strong returns to its shareholders. importantly, the firm exceeded all of its 2015 financial targets including those related to balance sheet optimization and managing its capital, its gsib surcharge and expense. on capital, the firm exceeded its capital target of reaching basel iii fully phased-in advanced and standardized cet1 ratios of approximately 11%, ending the year with estimated basel iii advanced fully phased-in cet1 capital and ratio of $173.2 billion and 11.6%, respectively. the firm also exceeded its target of reducing its gsib capital surcharge, ending the year at an estimated 3.5% gsib surcharge, achieved through a combination of reducing wholesale non-operating deposits, level 3 assets and derivative notionals.the firms fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio (slr) was 6.5% and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s fully phased-in slr was 6.6%. the firm was also compliant with the fully phased-in u.s. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and had $496 billion of hqla as of year-end 2015. the firms tangible book value per share was $48.13, an increase of 8% from the prior year. total stockholders equity was $247.6 billion at december 31, 2015. tangible book value per share and each of these basel iii advanced fully phased-in measures are non-gaap financial measures; they are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the firms capital position and liquidity. for further discussion of basel iii advanced fully phased-in measures and the slr under the u.s. final slr rule, see capital management on pages 149158, and for further discussion of lcr and hqla, see liquidity risk management on pages 159164.the firm provided credit to and raised capital of $2.0 trillion for its clients during 2015. this included $705 billion of credit to corporations, $233 billion of credit to consumers, and $22 billion to u.s. small businesses. during 2015, the firm also raised $1.0 trillion of capital for clients. additionally, $68 billion of credit was provided to, and capital was raised for, nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities.the firm has substantially completed its business simplification agenda, exiting businesses, products or clients that were non-core, not at scale or not returning the appropriate level of return in order to focus on core activities for its core clients and reduce risk to the firm. while the business simplification initiative impacted revenue growth in 2015, it did not have a meaningful impact on the firms profitability. the firm continues to focus on streamlining, simplifying and centralizing operational functions and processes in order to attain more consistencies and efficiencies across the firm. to that end, the firm continues to make progress on simplifying its legal entity structure, streamlining its global technology function, rationalizing its use of vendors, and optimizing its real estate location strategy.70jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportbusiness outlook these current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of jpmorgan chases management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties could cause the firms actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. see forward-looking statements on page 173 and the risk factors section on pages 818.business outlookjpmorgan chases outlook for the full-year 2016 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and u.s. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the u.s. and other countries where the firm does business. each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the firm and its lines of business. the firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. in the first quarter of 2016, management expects net interest income and net interest margin to be relatively flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. during 2016, if there are no changes in interest rates, management expects net interest income could be approximately $2 billion higher than in 2015, reflecting the federal reserves rate increase in december 2015 and loan growth.management expects core loan growth of approximately 10%-15% in 2016 as well as continued growth in retail deposits which are anticipated to lead to the firms balance sheet growing to approximately $2.45 trillion in 2016.management also expects managed noninterest revenue of approximately $50 billion in 2016, a decrease from 2015, primarily driven by lower card revenue reflecting renegotiated co-brand partnership agreements and lower revenue in mortgage banking. the firm continues to experience charge-offs at levels lower than its through-the-cycle expectations reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios, excluding oil & gas. management expects total net charge-offs of up to approximately $4.75 billion in 2016. based on the changes in market expectations for oil prices since year-end 2015, management believes reserves during the first quarter of 2016 could increase by approximately $500 million for oil & gas, and by approximately $100 million for metals & mining.the firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing in growth and innovation. the firm intends to leverage its scale and improve its operating efficiencies, in order to reinvest its expense savings in additional technology and marketing investments and fund other growth initiatives. as a result, firmwide adjusted expense in 2016 is expected to be approximately $56 billion (excluding firmwide legal expense). additionally, the firm will continue to adapt its capital assessment framework to review businesses and client relationships against multiple binding constraints, including gsib and other applicable capital requirements, imposing internal limits on business activities to align or optimize the firms balance sheet and risk-weighted assets (rwa) with regulatory requirements in order to ensure that business activities generate appropriate levels of shareholder value. during 2016, the firm expects the cet1 capital ratio calculated under the basel iii standardized approach to become its binding constraint. as a result of the anticipated growth in the balance sheet, management anticipates that the firm will have, over time, $1.55 trillion in standardized risk weighted assets, and is expecting that, over the next several years, its basel iii cet1 capital ratio will be between 11% and 12.5%. in the longer term, management expects to maintain a minimum basel iii cet1 ratio of 11%. it is the firms current intention that the firms capital ratios continue to exceed regulatory minimums as they are fully implemented in 2019 and thereafter. likewise, the firm will be evolving its funding framework to ensure it meets the current and proposed more stringent regulatory liquidity rules, including those relating to the availability of adequate total loss absorbing capacity (tlac).in mortgage banking within ccb, management expects noninterest revenue to decline by approximately $700 million in 2016 as servicing balances continue to decline from year-end 2015 levels. the card net charge-off rate is expected to be approximately 2.5% in 2016.in cib, management expects investment banking revenue in the first quarter of 2016 to be approximately 25% lower than the prior year first quarter, driven by current market conditions in the underwriting businesses.in addition, markets revenue to date in the first quarter of 2016 is down approximately 20%, when compared to a particularly strong period in the prior year and reflecting the current challenging market conditions. prior year markets revenue was positively impacted by macroeconomic events, including the swiss franc decoupling from the euro. actual markets revenue results for the first quarter will continue to be affected by market conditions, which can be volatile.in securities services, management expects revenue of approximately $875 million in the first quarter of 2016.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report71managements discussion and analysisconsolidated results of operationsthe following section of the md&a provides a comparative discussion of jpmorgan chases consolidated results of operations on a reported basis for the three-year period ended december31, 2015. factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in

2013, respectively.2015 compared with 2014 total net revenue for 2015 was down by 2% compared with the prior year, predominantly driven by lower corporate private equity gains, lower cib revenue reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives, and lower ccb mortgage banking revenue. these decreases were partially offset by a benefit from a legal settlement in corporate, and higher operating lease income, predominantly in ccb.investment banking fees increased from the prior year, reflecting higher advisory fees, partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting fees. the increase in advisory fees was driven by a greater share of fees for completed transactions as well as growth in industry-wide fee levels. the decrease in equity underwriting fees resulted from lower industry-wide issuance, and the decrease in debt underwriting fees resulted primarily from lower loan syndication and bond underwriting fees on lower industry-wide fee levels. for additional information on investment banking fees, see cib segment results on pages 9498 and note 7.principal transactions revenue decreased from the prior year, reflecting lower private equity gains in corporate driven by lower valuation gains and lower net gains on sales as the firm exits this non-core business. the decrease was partially offset by higher client-driven market-making revenue, particularly in foreign exchange, interest rate and equity-related products in cib, as well as a gain of approximately $160 million on ccbs investment in square, inc. upon its initial public offering. for additional information, see cib and corporate segment results on pages 9498 and pages 105106, respectively, and note 7.asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased compared with the prior year, largely as a result of lower fees in cib and lower performance fees in am. the decrease was partially offset by higher asset management fees as a result of net client inflows into assets under management and the impact of higher average market levels in am and ccb. for additional information, see the segment discussions of cib and am on pages 9498 and pages 102104, respectively, and note 7.mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting lower servicing revenue largely as a result of lower average third-party loans serviced, and lower net production revenue reflecting a lower repurchase benefit. for further information on mortgage fees and related income, see the segment discussion of ccb on pages 8593 and notes 7 and 17.for information on lending- and deposit-related fees, see the segment results for ccb on pages 8593, cib on pages 9498, and cb on pages 99101 and note 7; securities gains, see the corporate segment discussion on pages 105106; and card income, see ccb segment results on pages 8593.other income was relatively flat compared with the prior year, reflecting a $514 million benefit from a legal settlement in corporate, higher operating lease income as a result of growth in auto operating lease assets in ccb, and the absence of losses related to the exit of non-core portfolios in card. these increases were offset by the impact of business simplification in cib; the absence of a benefit recognized in 2014 from a franchise tax settlement; and losses related to the accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non-operating deposits.net interest income was relatively flat compared with the prior year, as lower loan yields, lower investment securities net interest income, and lower trading asset balance and yields were offset by higher average loan balances and lower interest expense on deposits. the firms average interest-earning assets were $2.1 trillion in 2015, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (fte) basis, was 2.14%, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year.2014 compared with 2013total net revenue for 2014 was down by 2% compared with the prior year, predominantly due to lower mortgage fees and related income and lower other income. the decrease was partially offset by higher asset management, administration and commissions revenue.investment banking fees increased compared with the prior year, due to higher advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. the increase 72jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportin advisory fees was driven by the combined impact of a greater share of fees for completed transactions, and growth in industry-wide fees. the increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by higher industry-wide issuance. the decrease in debt underwriting fees was primarily related to lower bond underwriting fees compared with the prior year, and lower loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide fees. principal transactions revenue increased as the prior year included a $1.5 billion loss related to the implementation of the funding valuation adjustment (fva) framework for over-the-counter (otc) derivatives and structured notes. private equity gains increased as a result of higher net gains on sales. these increases were partially offset by lower fixed income markets revenue in cib, primarily driven by credit-related and rates products, as well as the impact of business simplification initiatives. lending- and deposit-related fees decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives and lower trade finance revenue in cib. asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher asset management fees driven by net client inflows and higher market levels in am and ccb. the increase was offset partially by lower commissions and other fee revenue in ccb as a result of the exit of a non-core product in 2013. securities gains decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting lower repositioning activity related to the firms investment securities portfolio. mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the prior year, predominantly due to lower net production revenue driven by lower volumes due to higher mortgage interest rates, and tighter margins. the decline in net production revenue was partially offset by a lower loss on the risk management of mortgage servicing rights (msrs).card income was relatively flat compared with the prior year, but included higher net interchange income due to growth in credit and debit card sales volume, offset by higher amortization of new account origination costs. other income decreased from the prior year, predominantly from the absence of two significant items recorded in corporate in 2013: gains of $1.3 billion and $493 million from sales of visa shares and one chase manhattan plaza, respectively. lower valuations of seed capital investments in am and losses related to the exit of non-core portfolios in card also contributed to the decrease. these items were partially offset by higher auto lease income as a result of growth in auto lease volume, and a benefit from a tax settlement.net interest income increased slightly from the prior year, predominantly reflecting higher yields on investment securities, the impact of lower interest expense from lower rates, and higher average loan balances. the increase was partially offset by lower yields on loans due to the run-off of higher-yielding loans and new originations of lower-yielding loans, and lower average interest-earning trading asset balances. the firms average interest-earning assets were $2.0 trillion, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fte basis, was 2.18%, a decrease of 5 basis points from the prior year.provision for credit lossesyear ended december 31,(in millions)201520142013consumer, excluding credit card$(81)$419$(1,871)credit card3,1223,0792,179total

increase in the wholesale provision, largely reflecting the impact of downgrades in the oil & gas portfolio. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer provision, reflecting lower net charge-offs due to continued discipline in credit underwriting, as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment levels. the increase was partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses. for a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions of ccb on pages 8593, cb on pages 99101, and the allowance for credit losses on pages 130132.2014 compared with 2013the provision for credit losses increased by $2.9 billion from the prior year as result of a lower benefit from reductions in the consumer allowance for loan losses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. the consumer allowance reduction in 2014 was primarily related to the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio and reflected the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio. the wholesale provision reflected a continued favorable credit environment. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report73managements discussion and analysisnoninterest expenseyear ended december 31,(in millions)201520142013compensation

result of lower cib expense, predominantly reflecting the impact of business simplification; and lower ccb expense resulting from efficiencies related to declines in headcount-related expense and lower professional fees. these decreases were partially offset by investment in the businesses, including for infrastructure and controls.compensation expense decreased compared with the prior year, predominantly driven by lower performance-based incentives and reduced headcount, partially offset by higher postretirement benefit costs and investment in the businesses, including for infrastructure and controls.noncompensation expense decreased from the prior year, reflecting benefits from business simplification in cib; lower professional and outside services expense, reflecting lower legal services expense and a reduced number of contractors in the businesses; lower amortization of intangibles; and the absence of a goodwill impairment in corporate. these factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, largely associated with higher auto operating lease assets in ccb; higher marketing expense in ccb; and higher fdic-related assessments. legal expense was relatively flat compared with the prior year. for a further discussion of legal expense, see note 31.2014 compared with 2013total noninterest expense decreased by $9.2 billion, or 13%, from the prior year, as a

significant changes between december 31, 2015 and 2014.cash and due from banks and deposits with banksthe firms excess cash is placed with various central banks, predominantly federal reserve banks. the net decrease in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks was primarily due to the firms actions to reduce wholesale non-operating deposits.securities borrowedthe decrease was largely driven by a lower demand for securities to cover short positions in cib. for additional information, refer to notes 3 and 13.trading assetsdebt and equity instrumentsthe decrease was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in cib, which resulted in lower levels of both debt and equity instruments. for additional information, refer to note 3.trading assets and liabilitiesderivative receivables and payablesthe decrease in both receivables and payables was predominantly driven by declines in interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and equity derivatives due to market movements, maturities and settlements related to client-driven market-making activities in cib. for additional information, refer to derivative contracts on pages 127129, and notes 3 and 6.securitiesthe decrease was largely due to paydowns and sales of non-u.s. residential mortgage-backed securities, non-u.s. government debt securities, and non-u.s. corporate debt securities reflecting a shift to loans. for additional information related to securities, refer to the discussion in the corporate segment on pages 105106, and notes 3 and 12.loans and allowance for loan lossesthe increase in loans was attributable to an increase in consumer loans due to higher originations and retention of prime mortgages in mortgage banking (mb) and am, and higher originations of auto loans in ccb, as well as an increase in wholesale loans driven by increased client activity, notably in commercial real estate.the decrease in the allowance for loan losses was attributable to a lower consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses, driven by a reduction in the residential real estate portfolio allowance as a result of continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies and increased granularity in the impairment estimates. the wholesale allowance increased, largely reflecting the impact of downgrades in the oil & gas portfolio. for a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses, refer to credit risk management on pages 112132, and notes 3, 4, 14 and 15.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report75managements discussion and analysisaccrued interest and accounts receivablethe decrease was due to lower customer receivables related to client activity in cib, and a reduction in unsettled securities transactions.mortgage servicing rights for information on msrs, see note 17.other assetsother assets increased modestly as a result of an increase in income tax receivables, largely associated with the resolution of certain tax audits, and higher auto operating lease assets from growth in business volume. these factors were mostly offset by lower private equity investments driven by the sale of a portion of the private equity business and other portfolio sales.depositsthe decrease was attributable to lower wholesale deposits, partially offset by higher consumer deposits. the decrease in wholesale deposits reflected the impact of the firms actions to reduce non-operating deposits. the increase in consumer deposits reflected continuing positive growth from strong customer retention. for more information, refer to the liquidity risk management discussion on pages 159164; and notes 3 and 19.federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreementsthe decrease was due to a decline in secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments in cib and of investment securities in the chief investment office (cio). for additional information on the firms liquidity risk management, see pages 159164.commercial paperthe decrease was associated with the discontinuation of a cash management product that offered customers the option of sweeping their deposits into commercial paper (customer sweeps), and lower issuances in the wholesale markets, consistent with treasurys short-term funding plans. for additional information, see liquidity risk management on pages 159164.accounts payable and other liabilitiesthe decrease was due to lower brokerage customer payables related to client activity in cib.beneficial interests issued by consolidated viesthe decrease was predominantly due to a reduction in commercial paper issued by conduits to third parties and to maturities of certain municipal bond vehicles in cib, as well as net maturities of credit card securitizations. for further information on firm-sponsored vies and loan securitization trusts, see off-balance sheet arrangements on pages 7778 and note 16.long-term debtthe increase was due to net issuances, consistent with treasurys long-term funding plans. for additional information on the firms long-term debt activities, see liquidity risk management on pages 159164 and note 21.stockholders equitythe increase was due to net income and preferred stock issuances, partially offset by the declaration of cash dividends on common and preferred stock, and repurchases of common stock. for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (aoci), see note 25; for the firms capital actions, see capital management on page 157 and notes 22, 23 and 25.76jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportoff-balance sheet arrangements and contractual cash obligationsin the normal course of business, the firm enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s (u.s. gaap). the firm is involved with several types of offbalance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (spes), which are a type of vie, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).special-purpose entitiesthe most common type of vie is an spe. spes are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. spes are an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. spes may be organized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically established for a single, discrete purpose. spes are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and no employees. the basic spe structure involves a company selling assets to the spe; the spe funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors.jpmorgan chase uses spes as a source of liquidity for itself and its clients by securitizing financial assets, and by creating investment products for clients. the firm is involved with spes through multi-seller conduits, investor intermediation activities, and loan securitizations. see note 16 for further information on these types of spes.the firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all spe-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees.the firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any spe transaction, and its policies require that transactions with spes be conducted at arms length and reflect market pricing. consistent with this policy, no jpmorgan chase employee is permitted to invest in spes with which the firm is involved where such investment would violate the firms code of conduct. these rules prohibit employees from self-dealing and acting on behalf of the firm in transactions with which they or their family have any significant financial interest.implications of a credit rating downgrade to jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.for certain liquidity commitments to spes, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. could be required to provide funding if its short-term credit rating were downgraded below specific levels, primarily p-1, a-1 and f1 for moodys investors service (moodys), standard & poors and fitch, respectively. these liquidity commitments support the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by firm-administered consolidated spes. in the event of a short-term credit rating downgrade, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., absent other solutions, would be required to provide funding to the spe if the commercial paper could not be reissued as it matured. the aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding held by third parties as of december31, 2015 and 2014, was $8.7 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. the aggregate amounts of commercial paper issued by these spes could increase in future periods should clients of the firm-administered consolidated spes draw down on certain unfunded lending-related commitments. these unfunded lending-related commitments were $5.6 billion and $9.9 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the firm could facilitate the refinancing of some of the clients assets in order to reduce the funding obligation. for further information, see the discussion of firm-administered multi-seller conduits in note 16.the firm also acts as liquidity provider for certain municipal bond vehicles. the firms obligation to perform as liquidity provider is conditional and is limited by certain termination events, which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer and any credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. see note 16 for additional information.offbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsjpmorgan chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. as a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the firms view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. for further discussion of lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments, and the firms accounting for them, see lending-related commitments on page 127 and note 29. for a discussion of liabilities associated with loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications, see note 29.jpmorgan chase & co./2015

in cash and due from banks$(7,341)$(11,940)$(13,952)operating activitiesjpmorgan chases operating assets and liabilities support the firms lending and capital markets activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. the firm believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources are sufficient to meet the firms operating liquidity needs.cash provided by operating activities in 2015 resulted from a decrease in trading assets, predominantly due to client-driven market-making activities in cib, resulting in lower levels of debt and equity securities. additionally, cash was provided by a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower client receivables and higher net proceeds from loan sales activities. this was partially offset by cash used due to a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities, resulting from lower brokerage customer payables related to client activity in cib. in 2014 cash provided reflected higher net proceeds from loan securitizations and sales activities when compared with 2013. in 2013 cash provided reflected a decrease in trading assets from client-driven market-making activities in cib, resulting in lower levels of debt securities, partially offset by net cash used in connection with loans originated or purchased for sale. cash provided by operating activities for all periods also reflected net income after noncash operating adjustments.investing activitiesthe firms investing activities predominantly include loans originated to be held for investment, the investment securities portfolio and other short-term interest-earning assets. cash provided by investing activities during 2015 predominantly resulted from lower deposits with banks due to the firms actions to reduce wholesale non-operating deposits; and net proceeds from paydowns, maturities, sales and purchases of investment securities. partially offsetting these net inflows was cash used for net originations of consumer and wholesale loans, a portion of which reflected a shift from investment securities. cashused in investing activities during 2014 and 2013 resulted from increases in deposits with banks, attributable to higher levels of excess funds; cash was also used for growth in wholesale and consumer loans in 2014, while in 2013 cash used reflected growth only in wholesale loans. partially offsetting these cash outflows in 2014 and 2013 was a net decline in securities purchased under resale agreements due to a shift in the deployment of the firms excess cash by treasury, and a net decline in consumer loans in 2013 resulting from paydowns and portfolio runoff or liquidation of delinquent loans. investing activities in 2014 and 2013 also reflected net proceeds from paydowns, maturities, sales and purchases of investment securities.financing activitiesthe firms financing activities includes cash related to customer deposits, long-term debt, and preferred and common stock. cash used in financing activities in 2015 resulted from lower wholesale deposits partially offset by higher consumer deposits. additionally, in 2015 cash outflows were attributable to lower levels of commercial paper due to the discontinuation of a cash management product that offered customers the option of sweeping their deposits into commercial paper; lower commercial paper issuances in the wholesale markets; and a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements due to a decline in secured financings. cash provided by financing activities in 2014 and 2013 predominantly resulted from higher consumer and wholesale deposits; partially offset in 2013 by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly due to changes in the mix of the firms funding sources. for all periods, cash was provided by net proceeds from long-term borrowings and issuances of preferred stock; and cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.*     *     *for a further discussion of the activities affecting the

report79managements discussion and analysisexplanation and reconciliation of the firms use of non-gaap financial measuresthe firm prepares its consolidated financial statements using u.s. gaap; these financial statements appear on pages 176180. that presentation, which is referred to as reported basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the firms results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the firms performance with other companies u.s. gaap financial statements.in addition to analyzing the firms results on a reported basis, management reviews the firms results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a managed basis, which are non-gaap financial measures. the firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported u.s. gaap results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an fte basis. accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. this non-gaap financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. these adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the firm as a whole or by the lines of business.effective january 1, 2015, the firm adopted new accounting guidance for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit, which impacted the cib. as a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the firm made an accounting policy election to amortize the initial cost of qualifying investments in proportion to the tax credits and other benefits received, and to present the amortization as a component of income tax expense; previously such amounts were predominantly presented in other income. the guidance was required to be applied retrospectively and, accordingly, certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. the adoption of the guidance did not materially change the firms results of operations on a managed basis as the firm had previously presented and will continue to present the revenue from such investments on an fte basis in other income for the purposes of managed basis reporting.management also uses certain non-gaap financial measures at the business-segment level, because it believes these other non-gaap financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the business segment with the performance of its competitors. non- gaap financial measures used by the firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-gaap financial measures used by other companies.the following summary table provides a reconciliation from the firms reported u.s. gaap results to managed basis.201520142013year ended december 31,

interest income)in addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews net interest income excluding cibs markets-based activities to assess the performance of the firms lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. the data presented below are non-gaap financial measures due to the exclusion of cibs markets-based net interest income and related assets. management believes this exclusion provides investors and analysts with another measure by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.net interest income excluding cib markets-based activities

increased by $56.2 billion to $1.6 trillion. the increase in net interest income in 2015 predominantly reflected higher average loan balances and lower interest expense on deposits. the increase was partially offset by lower loan yields and lower investment securities net interest income. the increase in average interest-earning assets largely reflected the impact of higher average deposits with banks. these changes in net interest income and interest-earning assets resulted in the net interest yield decreasing by 4 basis points to 2.50% for 2015.2014 compared with 2013net interest income excluding cibs markets-based activities increased by $543 million in 2014 to $39.1 billion, and average interest-earning assets increased by $72.8 billion to $1.5 trillion. the increase in net interest income in 2014 predominantly reflected higher yields on investment securities, the impact of lower interest expense, and higher average loan balances. the increase was partially offset by lower yields on loans due to the run-off of higher-yielding loans and new originations of lower-yielding loans. the increase in average interest-earning assets largely reflected the impact of higher average balance of deposits with banks. these changes in net interest income and interest-earning assets resulted in the net interest yield decreasing by 9 basis points to 2.54% for 2014.82jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportbusiness segment resultsthe firm is managed on a line of business basis. there are four major reportable business segments  consumer & community banking, corporate & investment bank, commercial banking and asset management. in addition, there is a corporate segment.the business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. for a definition

adjustments & other  commercial term lending  real estate bankingdescription of business segment reporting methodology results of the business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. the management reporting process that derives business segment results allocates income and expense using market-based methodologies. the firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.revenue sharing when business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the firms clients, the participating business segments agree to share revenue from those transactions. the segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.funds transfer pricing funds transfer pricing is used to allocate interest income and expense to each business and transfer the primary interest rate risk exposures to the treasury group within corporate. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements of that segment as if it were operating independently, and as compared with its stand-alone peers. this process is overseen by senior management and reviewed by the firms asset-liability committee (alco).preferred stock dividend allocationas part of its funds transfer pricing process, the firm allocates substantially all of the cost of its outstanding preferred stock to its reportable business segments, while retaining the balance of the cost in corporate. this cost is included as a reduction to net income applicable to common equity in order to be consistent with the presentation of firmwide results. business segment capital allocation changes on at least an annual basis, the firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to its lines of business and updates the equity allocations to its lines of business as refinements are implemented.each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under basel iii advanced fully phased-in rules) and economic risk. the amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. for further information about line of business capital, see line of business equity on page 156.expense allocationwhere business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. the expense is generally allocatedbased on actual cost and use of services provided. in contrast, certain other costs related to corporate support jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report83managements discussion and analysisunits, or to certain technology and operations, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in corporate. expense retained in corporate generally includes parent company costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align corporate support units; and other items not aligned with a particular business segment. segment results  managed basisthe following tables summarize the business segment results

the provision for credit losses, predominantly offset by lower net revenue.net revenue was $6.8 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with the prior year. net interest income was $4.4 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year, due to higher loan balances resulting from originations of high-quality loans that have been retained, partially offset by spread compression. noninterest revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 32% from the prior year. this decrease was driven by lower servicing revenue, largely as a result of lower average third-party loans serviced and lower net production revenue, reflecting a lower repurchase benefit.the provision for credit losses was a benefit of $690 million, compared to a benefit of $217 million in the prior year, reflecting a larger reduction in the allowance for loan losses and lower net charge-offs. the current-year provision reflected a $600 million reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses and a $375 million reduction in the purchased credit-impaired allowance for loan losses; the prior-year provision included a $400 million reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses and a $300 million reduction in the purchased credit-impaired allowance for loan losses. these reductions were due to continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies in both periods, as well as increased granularity in the

compared with 2013mortgage banking net income was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 48%, from the prior year, driven by a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.net revenue was $7.8 billion, a decrease of 24%, compared with the prior year. net interest income was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 11%, driven by spread compression and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff and lower warehouse balances. noninterest revenue was $3.6 billion, a decrease of 34%, driven by lower net production revenue, largely reflecting lower volumes, lower servicing revenue, largely as a result of lower average third-party loans serviced, and lower revenue from an exited non-core product, largely offset by higher msr risk management income and lower msr asset amortization expense as a result of lower msr asset value. see note 17 for further information regarding changes in value of the msr asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.the provision for credit losses was a benefit of $217 million, compared to a benefit of $2.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting a smaller reduction in the allowance for loan losses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. the current-year provision reflected a $400 million reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses and $300 million reduction in the purchased credit-impaired allowance for loan losses; the prior-year provision included a $2.3 billion reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses and a $1.5 billion reduction in the purchased credit-impaired allowance for loan losses. these reductions were due to continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies.noninterest expense was $5.3 billion, a decrease of 30%, from

mattersthe financial crisis resulted in unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of 14 family residential real estate loans. such loans required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. foreclosure is usually a last resort, and accordingly, the firm has made, and continues to make, significant efforts to help borrowers remain in their homes.the firm entered into various consent orders and settlements with federal and state governmental agencies and private parties related to mortgage servicing, origination, and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. the requirements of these consent orders and settlements vary, but in the aggregate, include cash compensatory payments (in addition to fines) and/or borrower relief, which may include principal reduction, refinancing, short sale assistance, and other specified types of borrower relief. other obligations required under certain consent orders and settlements, as well as under new regulatory requirements, include enhanced mortgage servicing and foreclosure standards and processes.on june 11, 2015, the firm signed the second amended mortgage banking consent order (the amended occ consent order) with the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ), which focused on ten remaining open items from the original mortgage-servicing consent order entered into with the occ in april 2011 and imposed certain business restrictions on the firms mortgage banking activities.the firm completed its work on those items, and on january 4, 2016, the occ terminated the amended occ consent order and lifted the mortgage business restrictions. the firm remains under the mortgage-servicing consent order entered into with the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve) on april 13, 2011, as amended on february 28, 2013 (the federal reserve consent order). the audit committee of the board of directors will provide governance and oversight of the federal reserve consent order in 2016.the federal reserve consent order and certain other mortgage-related settlements are the subject of ongoing reporting to various regulators and independent overseers. the firms compliance with certain of these settlements is detailed in periodic reports published by the independent overseers. the firm is committed to fulfilling all of these commitments with appropriate due diligence and oversight.90jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcard, commerce solutions & autoselected income statement dataas of or for the year ended december 31,(in millions, except

reflected higher interest costs on higher long-term debt. equity markets revenue was $5.7 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by higher equity derivatives revenue across all regions. securities services revenue was $3.8 billion, down 13% from the prior year, driven by lower fees as well as lower net interest income. the provision for credit losses was $332 million, compared to a benefit of $161

morgan asset management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance. percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star:mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. a 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. a 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. a 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. a 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. a 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. the overall morningstar ratingis derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a funds three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) morningstar rating metrics. for u.s. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. the nomura star ratingis based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. all ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers mentioned in footnote (a). the data providers re-denominate the asset values into u.s. dollars. this % of aum is based on star ratings at the share class level for u.s. domiciled funds, and at a primary share classlevel to represent the star rating of all other funds except for japan where nomura provides ratings at the fund level. the primary share class, as defined by morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). the performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. past performance is not indicative of future results. percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): all quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers mentioned in footnote (b). quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. the data providers re-denominate the asset values into u.s. dollars. this % of aum is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for u.s. domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking of the u.k., luxembourg and hong kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. the primary share class, as defined by morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one primary share class territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to offshore territories and hk sfc authorized funds only). the performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. past performance is not indicative of future

discussion and analysistreasury and cio overviewtreasury and cio are predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the firms liquidity, funding and structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks, as well as executing the firms capital plan. the risks managed by treasury and cio arise from the activities undertaken by the firms four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.treasury and cio achieve the firms asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the firms investment securities portfolio. treasury and cio also use derivatives to meet the firms asset-liability management objectives. for further information on derivatives, see note 6. the investment securities portfolio primarily consists of u.s. and non-u.s. government securities, agency and

jpmorgan chases business activities. when the firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the firm takes on some degree of risk. the firms overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the firm.firmwide risk management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. the firms approach to risk management covers a broad spectrum of risk areas, such as credit, market, liquidity, model, structural interest rate, principal, country, operational, compliance, legal, capital and reputation risk, with controls and governance established for each area, as appropriate.the firm believes that effective risk management requires:acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the firm;ownership of risk management within each of the lines of business and corporate functions; andfirmwide structures for risk governance.the firms operating committee, which consists of the firms chief executive officer (ceo), chief risk officer (cro) and other senior executives, is responsible for developing and executing the firms risk management framework. the framework is intended to provide controls and ongoing management of key risks inherent in the firms business activities and create a culture of transparency, awareness and personal responsibility through reporting, collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information. the operating committee is responsible and accountable to the firms board of directors.the firm strives for continual improvement through ongoing employee training and development, as well as talent retention. the firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent board oversight.the impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the firms performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. the firm is also engaged in a

activities), and also the impact from the cio investment securities portfolio and other related cio and treasury activities.earnings-at-risk138-139risk appetite and governancethe firms overall tolerance for risk is governed by a risk appetite framework for measuring and monitoring risk. the framework measures the firms capacity to take risk against stated quantitative tolerances and qualitative factors at each of the line of business (lob) levels, as well as at the firmwide level. the framework and tolerances are set and approved by the firms ceo, chief financial officer (cfo), cro and chief operating officer (coo). lob-level risk appetite parameters and tolerances are set by the respective lob ceo, cfo and cro and are approved by the firms ceo, cfo, cro and coo. quantitative risk tolerances are expressed in terms of tolerance levels for stressed net income, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, structural interest rate risk, operational risk and capital. risk appetite results are reported quarterly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors (drpc).the firms cro is responsible for the overall direction of the firms risk management functions and is head of the risk management organization, reporting to the firms ceo and drpc. the risk management organization operates independently from the revenue-generating businesses, which enables it to provide credible challenge to the businesses. the leadership team of the risk management organization is aligned to the various lobs and corporate functions as well as across the firm for firmwide risk categories (e.g. firmwide market risk, firmwide model risk, firmwide reputation risk, etc.) producing a matrix structure with specific subject matter expertise to manage risks both within the businesses and across the firm. the firm places key reliance on each of the lobs as the first line of defense in risk governance. the lobs are accountable for identifying and addressing the risks in their 108jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportrespective businesses and for operating within a sound control environment.in addition to the risk management organization, the firms control environment also includes firmwide functions like oversight and control, compliance and internal audit.the firmwide oversight and control group consists of dedicated control officers within each of the lines of business and corporate functions, as well as a central oversight function. the group is charged with enhancing the firms control environment by looking within and across the lines of business andcorporate functions to identify and remediate control issues. the group enables the firm to detect control problems more quickly, escalate issues promptly and engage other stakeholders to understand common themes and interdependencies among the various parts of the firm.each line of business is accountable for managing its compliance risk. the firms compliance organization (compliance), which is independent of the lines of business, works closely with the operating committee and management to provide independent review, monitoring and oversight ofbusiness operations with a focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations applicable to the offering of the firms products and services to clients and customers.internal audit, a function independent of the businesses, compliance and the risk management organization, tests and evaluates the firms risk governance and management, as well as its internal control processes. this function brings a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of the firms governance, risk management and internal control processes. risk governance structurethe independent status of the risk management organization is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues up to senior management and the board of directors. the chart below illustrates the key senior management level committees in the firms risk governance structure. other committees and forums are in place that are responsible for management and oversight of risk, although they are not shown in the chart below. the board of directors provides oversight of risk principally through the drpc, audit committee and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, compensation & management development committee. each committee of the board oversees reputation risk issues within its scope of responsibility.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report109managements discussion and analysisthe risk policy committee of the board oversees the firms global risk management framework and approves the primary risk-management policies of the firm. the committees responsibilities include oversight of managements exercise of its responsibility to assess and manage risks of the firm, as well as its capital and liquidity planning and analysis.breaches in risk appetite tolerances, liquidity issues that may have a material adverse impact on the firm and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the committee.the audit committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of managements responsibilities to assure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the assets and income of the firm, assure the integrity of the firms financial statements and maintain compliance with the firms ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations.in addition, the audit committee assists the board in its oversight of the firms independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence.the independent internal audit function at the firm is headed by the general auditor, who reports to the audit committee.the compensation & management development committee assists the board in its oversight of the firms compensation programs and reviews and approves the firms overall compensation philosophy, incentive compensation pools, and compensation practices consistent with key business objectives and safety and soundness. the committee reviews operating committee members performance against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. the committee also periodically reviews the firms diversity programs and management development and succession planning, and provides oversight of the firms culture and conduct programs.among the firms senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions are:the firmwide risk committee (frc) is the firms highest management-level risk committee. it provides oversight of the risks inherent in the firms businesses. the committee is co-chaired by the firms ceo and cro. members of the committee include the firms coo, cfo, treasurer & chief investment officer, and general counsel, as well as lob ceos and cros, and other senior managers from risk and control functions. this committee serves as an escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by its members, the line of business risk committees, firmwide control committee, firmwide fiduciary risk governance committee, firmwide reputation risk governance and regional risk committees. the committee escalates significant issues to the board of directors, as appropriate.the firmwide control committee (fcc) is a forum for senior management to discuss firmwide operational risks including existing and emerging issues, to monitor operational risk metrics, and to review the execution of the operational risk management framework (ormf). the fcc is co-chaired by the chief control officer and the firmwide risk executive for operational risk governance. it serves as an escalation point for the line of business, corporate functions and regional control committees and escalates significant issues to the frc, as appropriate.the firmwide fiduciary risk governance committee (ffrgc) is a forum for risk matters related to the firms fiduciary activities. the committee oversees the firmwide fiduciary risk governance framework, which supports the consistent identification and escalation of fiduciary risk matters by the relevant lines of business or corporate functions responsible for managing fiduciary activities. the committee escalates significant issues to the frc and any other committee, as appropriate.the firmwide reputation risk governance group seeks to promote consistent management of reputation risk across the firm. its objectives are to increase visibility of reputation risk governance; promote and maintain a globally consistent governance model for reputation risk across lines of business; promote early self-identification of potential reputation risks to the firm; and provide thought leadership on cross-line-of-business reputation risk issues. each line of business has a separate reputation risk governance structure which includes, in most cases, one or more dedicated reputation risk committees.line of business and regional risk committees review the ways in which the particular line of business or the business operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees. these committees may escalate to the frc, as appropriate.line of business, corporate function and regional control committees oversee the control environment in the particular line of business or corporate function or the business operating in a particular region. they are responsible for reviewing the data indicating the quality and stability of the processes in a business or function, focusing on those processes with shortcomings and overseeing process remediation. these committees escalate to the fcc, as appropriate.110jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe asset liability committee (alco), chaired by the firms treasurer under the direction of the coo, monitors the firms balance sheet, liquidity risk and structural interest rate risk. alco reviews the firms overall structural interest rate risk position, funding requirements and strategy, and securitization programs (and any required liquidity support by the firm of such programs). alco is responsible for reviewing and approving the firms funds transfer pricing policy (through which lines of business transfer interest rate risk to treasury) and the firms intercompany funding and liquidity policy. alco is also responsible for reviewing the firms contingency funding plan.the capital governance committee, chaired by the head of the regulatory capital management office (under the direction of the firms cfo) is responsible for reviewing the firms capital management policy and the principles underlying capital issuance and distribution. the committee is also responsible for governing the capital adequacy assessment process, including overall design, assumptions and risk streams, and for ensuring that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the idiosyncratic risks across the firms businesses.the firmwide valuation governance forum (vgf) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the firm. the vgf is chaired by the firmwide head of the valuation control function (under the direction of the firms cfo), and includes sub-forums covering the corporate & investment bank, consumer & community banking, commercial banking, asset management and certain corporate functions, including treasury and chief investment office.in addition, the jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. board of directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. the jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. board accomplishes this function acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the firms board of directors. risk oversight on behalf of jpmorgan chase bank n.a. is primarily the responsibility of the drpc and audit committee of the firms board of directors and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the compensation & management development committee of the firms board of directors.risk measurementthe firm has a broad spectrum of risk management metrics, as appropriate for each risk category (refer to the table on key risks included on page 108). additionally, the firm is exposed to certain potential low-probability, but plausible and material, idiosyncratic risks that are not well-captured by its other existing risk analysis and reporting for credit, market, and other risks. these idiosyncratic risks may arise in a number of ways, such as changes in legislation, an unusual combination of market events, or specific counterparty events. the firm has a process intended to identify these risks in order to allow the firm to monitor vulnerabilities that are not adequately covered by its other standard risk measurements.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report111managements discussion and analysiscredit risk managementcredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the default of a customer, client or counterparty. the firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. in its consumer businesses, the firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its residential real estate, credit card, auto, business banking and student lending businesses. originated mortgage loans are retained in the mortgage portfolio, securitized or sold to u.s. government agencies and u.s. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. in its wholesale businesses, the firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities, investment securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks. a portion of the loans originated or acquired by the firms wholesale businesses are generally retained on the balance sheet; the firms syndicated loan business distributes a significant percentage of originations into the market and is an important component of portfolio management.credit risk

risk-based capital managementrisk identification and measurementthe credit risk management function identifies, measures, limits, manages and monitors credit risk across the firms businesses. to measure credit risk, the firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrowers credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.based on these factors and related market-based inputs, the firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. probable credit losses inherent in the consumer and wholesale loan portfolios are reflected in the allowance for loan losses, and probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments are reflected in the allowance for lending-related commitments. these losses are estimated using statistical analyses and other factors as described in note 15. in addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. the analyses for these losses include stress testing considering alternative economic scenarios as described in the stress testing section below. for further information, see critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages 165169.the methodologies used to estimate credit losses depend on the characteristics of the credit exposure, as described below.scored exposurethe scored portfolio is generally held in ccb and predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans, certain auto and business banking loans, and student loans. for the scored portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. the statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring, and decision-support tools, which consider loan-level factors such as delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values, and other risk factors. credit loss analyses also consider, as appropriate, uncertainties and other factors, including those related to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards, and other internal and external factors. the factors and analysis are updated on a quarterly basis or more frequently as market conditions dictate.risk-rated exposurerisk-rated portfolios are generally held in cib, cb and am, but also include certain business banking and auto dealer loans held in ccb that are risk-rated because they have characteristics similar to commercial loans. for the risk-rated portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default (pd) and loss severity given a default. the estimation process begins with risk ratings that are assigned to each loan facility to differentiate risk within the portfolio. these risk ratings are reviewed regularly by credit risk management and revised as needed to reflect the borrowers current financial position, risk profile and related collateral. the probability of default is the likelihood that a loan will default and not be fully repaid by the borrower. the loss given default (lgd) is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of 112jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.the probability of default is estimated for each borrower, and a loss given default is estimated for each credit facility. the calculations and assumptions are based on historic experience and management judgment and are reviewed regularly.stress testingstress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the firms credit portfolio. the process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the firm. economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally, are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, and applied across the businesses. the stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. in addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. the firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a firm and lob level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.risk monitoring and managementthe firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. the policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. in addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the line of businesses.for consumer credit risk, delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, are monitored, as certain of these trends can be modified through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. consumer risk management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. historical and forecasted trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. for further discussion of consumer loans, see note 14.wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised as deemed appropriate by management, typically on an annual basis. industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. in addition, wrong-way risk  the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterpartys capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing  is actively monitored as this risk could result in greater exposure at default compared with a transaction with another counterparty that does not have this risk.management of the firms wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:loan underwriting and credit approval processloan syndications and participationsloan sales and securitizationscredit derivativesmaster netting agreementscollateral and other risk-reduction techniquesin addition to credit risk management, internal audit performs periodic exams, as well as continuous reviews, where appropriate, of the firms consumer and wholesale portfolios. for risk-rated portfolios, a credit review group within internal audit is responsible for:independently assessing and validating the changing risk grades assigned to exposures; andevaluating the effectiveness of business units risk ratings, including the accuracy and consistency of risk grades, the timeliness of risk grade changes and the justification of risk grades in credit memoranda.risk reportingto enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of credit risk management. detailed portfolio reporting of industry, customer, product and geographic concentrations occurs monthly, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the board of directors as appropriate.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report113managements discussion and analysiscredit

estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans, and student loans. the firms focus is on serving the prime segment of the consumer credit market. the credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to benefit from discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment. both early-stage delinquencies (3089 days delinquent) and late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) for residential real estate, excluding government guaranteed loans, declined from december31, 2014 levels. the

2015, predominantly due to originations of high-quality prime mortgage loans that have been retained, partially offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. credit performance has continued to improve across most portfolios as the economy strengthened and home prices increased.pci loans are excluded from the following discussions of individual loan products and are addressed separately below. for further information about the firms consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see note 14.home equity: the home equity portfolio declined from december31, 2014 primarily reflecting loan paydowns and charge-offs. both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies declined from december31, 2014. net charge-offs for both senior and junior lien home equity loans at december 31, 2015, declined when compared with the prior year as a result of improvement in home prices and delinquencies, but charge-offs remain elevated compared with pre-recessionary levels.at december 31, 2015, approximately 15% of the firms home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (heloans) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (helocs). heloans are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 330 years. approximately 60% of the heloans are senior lien loans and the remainder are junior lien loans. in general, helocs originated by the firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the heloc recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization period. at the time of origination, the borrower typically selects one of two minimum payment options that will generally remain in effect during the revolving period: a monthly payment of 1% of the outstanding balance, or interest-only payments based on a variable index (typically prime). helocs originated by washington mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the heloc converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loans term.the unpaid principal balance of helocs outstanding was $41 billion at december31, 2015. since january 1, 2014, approximately $8 billion of helocs have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments; based upon contractual terms, approximately $19 billion is scheduled to recast in the future, consisting of $7 billion in 2016, $6 billion in 2017 and $6 billion in 2018 and beyond. however, of the total $19 billion scheduled to recast in the future, $13 billion is expected to actually recast; and the remaining $6 billion represents loans to borrowers who are expected to pre-pay or loans that are likely to charge-off prior to recast. the firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with the corresponding estimated probability of default and loss severity assumptions. certain factors, such as future developments in both unemployment rates and home prices, could have a significant impact on the performance of these loans.the firm manages the risk of helocs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. the firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term repricing and recast risks inherent in its heloc portfolio to ensure that changes in the firms estimate of incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for loan losses and that the firms account management practices are appropriate given the portfolios risk profile.high-risk seconds are junior lien loans where the borrower has a senior lien loan that is either delinquent or has been modified. such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than junior lien loans for which the senior lien loan is neither delinquent nor modified. the firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data and loan level credit bureau data (which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien loan). the estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior lien loans into and out of the 30+ day delinquency bucket.116jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcurrent high-risk secondsdecember 31, (in billions)20152014junior liens subordinate to:modified current senior lien$0.6$0.7senior lien 30  89 days

nonaccrual loans. at december31, 2015 and 2014, excluded approximately $25 million and $50 million, respectively, of junior liens that are performing but not current, which were placed on nonaccrual in accordance with the regulatory guidance.of the estimated $1.4 billion of current high-risk junior liens at december31, 2015, the firm owns approximately 10% and services approximately 25% of the related senior lien loans to the same borrowers. the increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.mortgage: prime mortgages, including option arms and loans held-for-sale, increased from december31, 2014 due to originations of high-quality prime mortgage loans that have been retained partially offset by paydowns, the run-off of option arm loans and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. high-quality loan originations for the year ending december31, 2015 included both jumbo and conforming loans, primarily consisting of fixed interest rate loans. excluding loans insured by u.s. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies declined from december31, 2014. nonaccrual loans decreased from the prior year but remain elevated primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities. net charge-offs remain low, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies.at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firms prime mortgage portfolio included $11.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, of mortgage loans insured and/or guaranteed by u.s. government agencies, of which $8.4 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, were 30 days or more past due (of these past due loans, $6.3 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, were 90 days or more past due). in 2014, the firm entered into a settlement regarding loans insured under federal mortgage insurance programs overseen by the federal housing administration (fha), the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud), and the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va); the firm will continue to monitor exposure on future claim payments for government insured loans, but any financial impact related to exposure on future claims is not expected to be significant and was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firms prime mortgage portfolio included $17.7 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans, which represented 11% and 15%, respectively, of the prime mortgage portfolio. these loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. to date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader prime mortgage portfolio and the firms expectations. the firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans.subprime mortgages continued to decrease due to portfolio runoff. early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have improved from december31, 2014. net charge-offs continued to improve as a result of improvement in home prices and delinquencies.auto: auto loans increased from december31, 2014, as new originations outpaced paydowns and payoffs. nonaccrual loans were stable compared with december31, 2014. net charge-offs for the year ended december31, 2015 increased compared with the prior year, as a result of higher loan balances and a moderate increase in loss severity. the auto loan portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality credits.business banking: business banking loans increased from december31, 2014 due to an increase in loan originations. nonaccrual loans declined from december31, 2014 and net charge-offs for the year ended december31, 2015 decreased from the prior year due to continued discipline in credit underwriting.student and other: student and other loans decreased from december31, 2014 due primarily to the run-off of the student loan portfolio as the firm ceased originations of student loans during the fourth quarter of 2013. nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs also declined as a result of the run-off of the student loan portfolio.purchased credit-impaired loans: pci loans acquired in the washington mutual transaction decreased as the portfolio continues to run off.as of december31, 2015, approximately 14% of the option arm pci loans were delinquent and approximately 64% of the portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. this latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. default rates generally increase on option arm loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. the expected increase in default rates is considered in the firms quarterly impairment assessment.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report117managements discussion and analysisthe following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss

composition of residential real estate loansat december31, 2015, $123.0 billion, or 61% of total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by u.s. government agencies and pci loans, were concentrated in california, new york, illinois, texas and florida, compared with $94.3 billion, or 63%, at december31, 2014. california had the greatest concentration of retained residential loans with 28% at december31, 2015, compared with 26% at december31, 2014. the unpaid principal balance of pci loans concentrated in these five states represented 74% of total pci loans at both december31, 2015, and december31, 2014. for further information on the geographic composition of the firms residential real estate loans, see note 14.     current estimated loan-to-values (ltvs) of residential real estate loansthe current estimated average ltv ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by u.s. government agencies and pci loans, was 59% at both december31, 2015 and 2014.although home prices continue to recover, the decline inhome prices since 2007 has had a significant impact on the collateral values underlying the firms residential real estate loan portfolio. in general, the delinquency rate for loans with high ltv ratios is greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has greater equity in the collateral. while a large portion of the loans with current estimated ltv ratios greater than 100% continue to pay and are current, the continued willingness and ability of these borrowers to pay remains a risk.118jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe following table presents the current estimated ltv ratios for pci loans, as well as the ratios of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value. because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratios of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated ltv ratios, which are based on the unpaid principal balances. the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.ltv ratios and ratios of carrying values to current estimated

acquisition and is also net of the allowance for loan losses at december31, 2015 and 2014 of $985 million and $1.2 billion for prime mortgage, $49 million and $194 million for option arms, $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion for home equity, respectively, and $180 million for subprime mortgage at december31, 2014. there was no allowance for loan losses for subprime mortgage at december31, 2015. (e)the current period ratio has been updated to include the effect of any outstanding senior lien related to a property for which the firm holds the junior home equity lien. the prior period ratio has been revised to conform with the current presentation. the current estimated average ltv ratios were 65% and 78% for california and florida pci loans, respectively, at december31, 2015, compared with 71% and 85%, respectively, at december31, 2014. average ltv ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices as well as a result of loan pay downs. although home prices have improved, home prices in most areas of california and florida are still lower than at the peak of the housing market; this continues to negatively affect current estimated average ltv ratios and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the pci portfolio. of the total pci portfolio, 6% of the loans had a current estimated ltv ratio greater than 100%, and 1% had a current ltv ratio of greater than 125% at december31, 2015, compared with 10% and 2%, respectively, at december31, 2014.while the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of pci loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing.for further information on current estimated ltvs of residential real estate loans, see note 14.loan modification activities  residential real estate loansthe performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding pci loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted-average redefault rates of 20% for senior lien home equity, 22% for junior lien home equity, 17% for prime mortgages including option arms, and 29% for subprime mortgages. the cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the pci residential real estate portfolio that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 20% for home equity, 19% for prime mortgages, 16% for option arms and 33% for subprime mortgages. the favorable performance of the pci option arm modifications is the result of a targeted proactive program which fixed the borrowers payment to the amount at the point of modification. the cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both the u.s. governments home affordable modification program (hamp) and the firms proprietary modification programs (primarily the firms modification program that was modeled after hamp) from october 1, 2009, through december31, 2015.certain loans that were modified under hamp and the firms proprietary modification programs have interest rate reset provisions (step-rate modifications). interest rates on these loans generally began to increase in 2014 by 1% per year and will continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap, typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate loan as of the modification date. the jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report119managements discussion and analysiscarrying value of non-pci loans modified in step-rate modifications was $4 billion at december31, 2015, with $447 million that experienced the initial interest rate increase in 2015 and $1 billion that is scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in each of 2016 and 2017. the unpaid principal balance of pci loans modified in step-rate modifications was $10 billion at december31, 2015, with $1 billion that experienced the initial interest rate increase in 2015, and $3 billion and $2 billion scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in 2016 and 2017, respectively. the firm continues to monitor this risk exposure to ensure that it is appropriately considered in the allowance for loan losses.the following table presents information as of december31, 2015 and 2014, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. modifications of pci loans continue to be accounted for and reported as pci loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the firms quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. modifications of consumer loans other than pci loans are generally accounted for and reported as tdrs. for further information on modifications for the years ended december31, 2015 and 2014, see note 14.modified

million and $462 million, respectively. these amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b)excludes pci loans that were acquired as part of the washington mutual transaction, which are accounted for on a pool basis. since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. because the firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, each pool is considered to be performing.nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled $4.8 billion and $5.8 billion at december31, 2015, and 2014, respectively, of which 31% and 32%, respectively, were greater than 150 days past due. in the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 44% and 50% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. active and suspended foreclosure: for information

originations and increased credit card sales volume partially offset by sales of non-core loans and the transfer of commercial card loans to the cib. the 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.43% at december31, 2015, from 1.44% at december31, 2014. for the years ended december31, 2015 and 2014, the net charge-off rates were 2.51% and 2.75%, respectively. the credit card 30+ day delinquency rate and net charge-off rate remain near historic lows. charge-offs have improved compared to a year ago due to continued discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by lower unemployment. the credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, largely rewards-based portfolio that has good u.s. geographic diversification. loans outstanding in the top five states of california, texas, new york, florida and illinois consisted of $57.5 billion in receivables, or 44% of the retained loan portfolio, at december31, 2015, compared with $54.9 billion, or 43%, at december31, 2014. the greatest geographic concentration of credit card retained loans is in california, which represented 14% of total retained loans at both december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. for further information on the geographic composition of the firms credit card loans, see note 14. modifications of credit card loansat december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in tdrs. these balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. the decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from december31, 2014, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans. consistent with the firms policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. however, the firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see note 14.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report121managements discussion and analysiswholesale credit portfoliothe firms wholesale businesses are exposed to credit risk through underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services such as cash management and clearing activities. a portion of the loans originated or acquired by the firms wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. the firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.the wholesale credit portfolio, excluding oil & gas, continued to be generally stable throughout 2015, characterized by low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. growth in loans retained was driven by increased client activity, notably in commercial real estate.discipline in underwriting across all areas of lending continues to remain a key point of focus. the wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable; and of industry, product and client concentrations.wholesale credit portfoliodecember 31,credit exposurenonperforming(c)(in millions)2015201420152014loans

significant exposure and/or present actual or potential credit concerns. for additional information, refer to the tables on the previous pages.real estate: exposure to this industry increased by $10.9 billion, or 10%, in 2015 to $116.9 billion. the increase was largely driven by growth in multifamily exposure in commercial banking. the credit quality of this industry remained stable as the investment-grade portion of the exposures was 75% for 2015 and 2014. the ratio of nonaccrual retained loans to total retained loans decreased to 0.25% at december 31, 2015 from 0.32% at december 31, 2014. for further information on commercial real estate loans, see note 14.oil & gas: exposure to the oil & gas industry was approximately 5.3% and 5.4% of the firms total wholesale exposure as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. exposure to this industry decreased by $1.1 billion in 2015 to $42.1 billion; of the $42.1 billion, $13.3 billion was drawn at year-end. as of december 31, 2015, approximately $24 billion of the exposure was investment-grade, of which $4 billion was drawn, and approximately $18 billion of the exposure was high yield, of which $9 billion was drawn. as of december 31, 2015, $23.5 billion of the portfolio was concentrated in the exploration & production and oilfield services sub-sectors, 36% of which exposure was drawn. exposure to other sub-sectors, including integrated oil and gas firms, midstream/oil pipeline companies, and refineries, is predominantly investment-grade. as of december 31, 2015, secured lending, which largely consists of reserve-based lending to the oil & gas industry, was $12.3 billion, 44% of which exposure was drawn. in addition to $42.1 billion in exposure classified as oil & gas, the firm had $4.3 billion in exposure to natural gas pipelines and related distribution businesses, of which $893 million was drawn at year end and 63% was investment-grade, and $4.1 billion in exposure to commercial real estate in geographies sensitive to the oil & gas industry. the firm continues to actively monitor and manage its exposure to the oil & gas industry in light of market conditions, and is also actively monitoring potential contagion effects on other related or dependent industries.metals & mining: exposure to the metals & mining industry was approximately 1.8% and 1.9% of the firms total wholesale exposure as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. exposure to the metals & mining industry decreased by $920 million in 2015 to $14.0 billion, of which $4.6 billion was drawn. the portfolio largely consists of exposure in north america, and 59% is concentrated in the steel and diversified mining sub-sectors. approximately 46% of the exposure in the metals & mining portfolio was investment-grade as of december 31, 2015, a decrease from 55% as of december 31, 2014, due to downgrades.loansin the normal course of its wholesale business, the firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. the firm actively manages its wholesale credit exposure. one way of managing credit risk is through secondary market sales of loans and lending-related commitments. for further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators and sales of loans, see note 14.the following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the years ended december31, 2015 and 2014.wholesale nonaccrual loan activityyear ended december 31, (in millions)20152014beginning

customers primarily represent margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients that are collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients brokerage accounts which are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements. in the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. if additional collateral is not provided by the client, the clients position may be liquidated by the firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements.lending-related commitmentsthe firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts.in the firms view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firms likely actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. in determining the amount of credit risk exposure the firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the firm has established a loan-equivalent amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. the loan-equivalent amount of the firms lending-related commitments was $212.4 billion and $216.5 billion as of december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.clearing servicesthe firm provides clearing services for clients entering into securities and derivative transactions. through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by central counterparties (ccps). where possible, the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. for further discussion of clearing services, see note 29.derivative contractsin the normal course of business, the firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed. for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. for exchange-traded derivatives (etd), such as futures and options and cleared over-the-counter (otc-cleared) derivatives, the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp. where possible, the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. for further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types, see note 6.the following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.derivative receivablesdecember 31, (in millions)20152014interest rate$26,363$33,725credit derivatives1,4231,838foreign exchange17,17721,253equity5,5298,177commodity9,18513,982total, net of cash

consolidated balance sheets were $59.7 billion and $79.0 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts, after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm. however, in managements view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily u.s. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (g7) government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $16.6 billion and $19.6 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the firms favor. the decrease in derivative receivables was predominantly driven by declines in interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and equity derivatives due to market movements, maturities and settlements related to client-driven market-making activities in cib.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report127managements discussion and analysisin addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash; g7 government securities; other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities; and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the clients derivative transactions move in the firms favor. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm held $43.7 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively, of this additional collateral. the derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. for additional information on the firms use of collateral agreements, see note 6.while useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: peak, derivative risk equivalent (dre), and average exposure (avg). these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level. peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management. dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.finally, avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firms derivative receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of collateral. avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva, as further described below. the three year avg exposure was $32.4 billion and $37.5 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared with derivative receivables, net of all collateral, of $43.1 billion and $59.4 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the fair value of the firms derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment, the cva, to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. the cva is based on the firms avg to a counterparty and the counterpartys credit spread in the credit derivatives market. the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads, new deal activity or unwinds, and changes in the underlying market environment. the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. in addition, the firms risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the firms exposure to a counterparty (avg) and the counterpartys credit quality. many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. to the extent that these correlations are identified, the firm may adjust the cva associated with that counterpartys avg. the firm risk manages exposure to changes in cva by entering into credit derivative transactions, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative transactions.the accompanying graph shows exposure profiles to the firms current derivatives portfolio over the next 10years as calculated by the peak, dre and avg metrics. the three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.exposure profile of derivatives measuresdecember 31, 2015(in billions)128jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe following table

amounts have been revised to conform with current period presentation.as previously noted, the firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. the percentage of the firms derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements  excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity  was 87% as of december31, 2015, largely unchanged compared with 88% as of december31, 2014.credit derivativesthe firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the firms own credit risk associated with various exposures. for a detailed description of credit derivatives, see credit derivatives in note 6.credit portfolio management activitiesincluded in the firms end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the firms wholesale businesses (collectively, credit portfolio management activities). information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. for further information on derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, see credit derivatives in note 6.the firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the firms market-making businesses. these credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities; for further information on these credit derivatives as well as credit derivatives used in the firms capacity as a market-maker in credit derivatives, see credit derivatives in note 6.credit

protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index.the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s. gaap; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. in contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. this asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the firms view, of the true changes in value of the firms overall credit exposure.the effectiveness of the firms credit default swap (cds) protection as a hedge of the firms exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased cds); the contractual terms of the cds (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the firm); and the maturity of the firms cds protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the firms exposures). however, the firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the firm.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report129managements discussion and analysisallowance for credit losses jpmorgan chases allowance for loan losses covers both the consumer (primarily scored) portfolio and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio. the allowance represents managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the firms loan portfolio. management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments.for a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, see critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages 165169 and note 15.at least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the chief risk officer, the chief financial officer and the controller of the firm, and discussed with the drpc and audit committee of the firms board of directors. as of december31, 2015, jpmorgan chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.the consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses decreased from december31, 2014, due to a reduction in the residential real estate portfolio allowance, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies and increased granularity in the impairment estimates. for additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see consumer credit portfolio on pages 115121 and note 14.the credit card allowance for loan losses was relatively unchanged from december31, 2014, reflecting stable credit quality trends. for additional information about delinquencies in the credit card loan portfolio, see consumer credit portfolio on pages 115121 and note 14.the wholesale allowance for credit losses increased from december 31, 2014, reflecting the impact of downgrades in the oil & gas portfolio. excluding oil and gas, the wholesale portfolio continued to experience generally stable credit quality trends and low charge-off rates.130jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportsummary of changes in the allowance for credit losses20152014year ended december

compared with $3.1 billion for the year ended december31, 2014. the total consumer provision for credit losses for the year ended december31, 2015 reflected lower net charge-offs due to continued discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment, partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan loss

risk is the potential for adverse changes in the value of the firms assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, implied volatilities or credit spreads.market risk managementmarket risk management, part of the independent risk management function, is responsible for identifying and monitoring market risks throughout the firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. the market risk function reports to the firms cro.market risk seeks to control risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the firms market risk profile for senior management, the board of directors and regulators. market risk is

within its units. the independent risk management group responsible for overseeing each line of business is charged with ensuring that all material market risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk policy framework set out by market risk.risk measurementtools used to measure risk because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the firm uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, including:vareconomic-value stress testingnonstatistical risk measuresloss advisoriesprofit and loss drawdownsearnings-at-riskrisk monitoring and control market risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. in setting limits, the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity and accommodation of client business and management experience. the firm maintains different levels of limits. corporate level limits include var and stress limits. similarly, line of business limits include var and stress limits and may be supplemented by loss advisories, nonstatistical measurements and profit and loss drawdowns. limits may also be set within the lines of business, as well at the portfolio or legal entity level.limits are set by market risk and are regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate, with any changes approved by line of business management and market risk. senior management, including the firms ceo and cro, are responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. all limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by market risk are escalated to senior management. the lines of business are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, market risk and senior management. in the event of a breach, market risk consults with firm senior management and the line of business senior management to determine the appropriate course of action required to return to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach. certain firm or line of business-level limits that have been breached for three business days or longer, or by more than 30%, are escalated to senior

environment. the firm has a single var framework used as a basis for calculating risk management var and regulatory var.the framework is employed across the firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. the frameworks approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. the firm believes the use of risk management var provides a stable measure of var that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business, and provides the necessary and appropriate information needed to respond to risk events on a daily basis.risk management var is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. var provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks across businesses and monitoring limits. these var results are reported to senior management, the board of directors and regulators.under the firms risk management var methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the firm would expect to incur var band breaks, defined as losses greater than that predicted by var estimates, not more than five times every 100 trading days. the number of var band breaks observed can differ from the statistically expected number of band breaks if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the var calculation.underlying the overall var model framework are individual var models that simulate historical market returns for individual products and/or risk factors. to capture material market risks as part of the firms risk management framework, comprehensive var model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. these var models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. the var model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the firm level.for certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in var due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data for these products. the firm uses proxies to estimate the var for these and other products when daily time series are not available. it is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the var results presented. in addition, data sources used in var models may not be the same as those used for financial statement valuations. in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in var historical time series, the sources may differ. the daily market data used in var models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for vcg price testing in vcgs monthly valuation process (see valuation process in note 3 for further information on the firms valuation process). var model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation and therefore it is not practical to use the data collected in the vcg monthly valuation process. since var is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses, and it is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. in addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, var measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. the firm therefore considers other measures in addition to var, such as stress testing, to capture and manage its market risk positions.the firms var model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the firms modeling techniques and other factors. such changes may also affect historical comparisons of var results. model changes undergo a review and approval process by the model review group prior to implementation into the operating environment. for further information, see model risk on page 142.the firm calculates separately a daily aggregated var in accordance with regulatory rules (regulatory var), which is used to derive the firms regulatory var-based capital requirements under basel iii. this regulatory var model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. regulatory var is applied to covered positions as defined by basel iii, which may be different than the positions included in the firms risk management var. for example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the firms risk management var, while regulatory var excludes these credit derivative hedges. in addition, in contrast to the firms risk management var, regulatory var currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain var models.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report135managements discussion and analysisfor additional information on regulatory var and the other components of market risk regulatory capital (e.g. var-based measure, stressed var-based measure and the respective backtesting) for the firm, see jpmorgan chases basel iii pillar 3 regulatory capital disclosures reports, which are available on the firms website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm).the table below shows the results of the firms risk management var measure using a 95%

as not meaningful (nm), because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for distinct risk components, and hence it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio-diversification effect.as presented in the table above, average total var and average cib var increased during 2015 when compared with 2014. the increase in total var was primarily due to higher volatility in the cib in the historical one-year look-back period during 2015 versus 2014.average cib trading var increased during 2015 primarily due to higher var in the fixed income and equities risk factors reflecting a combination of higher market volatility and increased exposure.average mortgage banking var decreased from the prior year. average mortgage banking var was elevated late in the second quarter of 2014 due to a change in the msr hedge position made in advance of an anticipated update to certain msr model assumptions; when such updates were implemented, the msr var decreased to levels more consistent with prior periods.the firm continues to enhance the var model calculations and time series inputs related to certain asset-backed products.the firms average total var diversification benefit was $10 million or 21% of the sum for 2015, compared with $7 million or 16% of the sum for 2014. in general, over the course of the year, var exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.var back-testingthe firm evaluates the effectiveness of its var methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily risk management var results with the daily gains and losses recognized on market-risk related revenue.the firms definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under basel iii. under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the firms risk management var, excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments (e.g., liquidity and dva), net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading.136jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe following chart compares the daily market risk-related gains and losses with the firms risk management var for the year ended december 31, 2015. as the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the firms risk management var, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the market risk section of the firms basel iii pillar 3 regulatory capital disclosures reports, which are based on regulatory var applied to covered positions. the chart shows that for the year ended december 31, 2015, the firm observed three var band breaks and posted market risk-related gains on 117 of the 260 days in this period.other risk measures economic-value stress testing along with var, stress testing is an important tool in measuring and controlling risk. while var reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing is intended to capture the firms exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. the firm runs weekly stress tests on market-related risks across the lines of business using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in risk factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates or commodity prices. the firm uses a number of standard scenarios that capture different risk factors across asset classes including geographical factors, specific idiosyncratic factors and extreme tail events. the stress framework calculates multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs for each risk factor and combines them in multiple ways to capture different market scenarios. for example, certain scenarios assess the potential loss arising from current exposures held by the firm due to a broad sell off in bond markets or an extreme widening in corporate credit spreads. the flexibility of the stress testing framework allows risk managers to construct new, specific scenarios that can be used to form decisions about future possible stress events.stress testing complements var by allowing risk managersto shock current market prices to more extreme levels relative to those historically realized, and to stress test the relationships between market prices under extreme scenarios. stress-test results, trends and qualitative explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the respective lobs and the firms senior management to allow them to better understand the sensitivity of positions to certain defined events and to enable them to manage their risks with more transparency. in addition, results are reported to the board of directors.stress scenarios are defined and reviewed by market risk, and significant changes are reviewed by the relevant lob risk committees and may be redefined on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions. the firms stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results under scenarios mandated by the federal reserves comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) and jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report137managements discussion and analysisinternal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap)processes. in addition, the results are incorporated into the quarterly assessment of the firms risk appetite framework and are also presented to the drpc.nonstatistical risk measures nonstatistical risk measures include sensitivities to variables used to value positions, such as credit spread sensitivities, interest rate basis point values and market values. these measures provide granular information on the firms market risk exposure. they are aggregated by line of business and by risk type, and are also used for monitoring internal market risk limits.loss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns loss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns are tools used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. profit and loss drawdowns are defined as the decline in net profit and loss since the year-to-date peak revenue level.earnings-at-risk the var and stress-test measures described above illustrate the economic sensitivity of the firms consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables. the effect of interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks. interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure through earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the firms net interest income and interest rate-sensitive fees. earnings-at-risk excludes the impact of cibs markets-based activities and msrs, as these sensitivities are captured under var.the cio, treasury and corporate (ctc) risk committee establishes the firms structural interest rate risk policies and market risk limits, which are subject to approval by the drpc. the cio, working in partnership with the lines of business, calculates the firms structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management including the ctc risk committee and the firms alco. in addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the ctc cro. this risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. the firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors, including:differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instrumentsdifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same timedifferences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates changethe firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, firmwide basis. business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury and cio through a transfer-pricing system, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. these elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. all transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.the firm generates a net interest income baseline, and then conducts simulations of changes for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in u.s. dollar and other currencies (non-u.s. dollar currencies). earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this net interest income baseline, excluding cibs markets-based activities and msrs, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions. these scenarios may consider the impact on exposures as a result of changes in interest rates from baseline rates, as well as pricing sensitivities of deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. the scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions which could be taken by the firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. for example, mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. the firms earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the firms simulation and other factors. 138jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reporteffective january 1, 2015, the firm conducts earnings-at-risk simulations for assets and liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars separately from assets and liabilities denominated in non-u.s. dollar currencies in order to enhance the firms ability to monitor structural interest rate risk from non-u.s. dollar exposures.the firms u.s. dollar sensitivity is presented in the table below. the result of the non-u.s. dollar sensitivity scenarios were not material to the firms earnings-at-risk at december 31, 2015.jpmorgan chases 12-month pretax net interest income sensitivity profiles(excludes the impact of cibs markets-based

rising rates on u.s. dollar assets and liabilities is largely a result of reinvesting at higher yields and assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits. the firms net u.s. dollar sensitivity

rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels  results in a 12-month pretax benefit to net interest income, excluding cibs markets-based activities and msrs, of approximately $700 million. the increase in net interest income under this scenario reflects the firm reinvesting at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged. the result of the comparable non-u.s. dollar scenario was not material to the firm.non-u.s. dollar fx risknon-u.s. dollar fx risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the firms

issuing debt in denominations other than the u.s. dollar. treasury and cio, working in partnership with the lines of business, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the firm.treasury and cio may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives within risk limits governed by the ctc risk committee.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report139managements discussion and analysiscountry risk managementcountry risk is the risk that a sovereign event or action alters the value or terms of contractual obligations of obligors, counterparties and issuers or adversely affects markets related to a particular country. the firm has a comprehensive country risk management framework for assessing country risks, determining risk tolerance, and measuring and monitoring direct country exposures in the firm. the country risk management group is responsible for developing guidelines and policies for managing country risk in both emerging and developed countries. the country risk management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk to ensure the firms country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the firms strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.country risk organizationthe country risk management group, part of the independent risk management function, works in close partnership with other risk functions to identify and monitor country risk within the firm. the firmwide risk executive for country risk reports to the firms cro.country risk management is responsible for the following functions:developing guidelines and policies consistent with a comprehensive country risk frameworkassigning sovereign ratings and assessing country risksmeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the firmmanaging country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior managementdeveloping surveillance tools for early identification of potential country risk concernsproviding country risk scenario analysiscountry risk identification and measurementthe firm is exposed to country risk through its lending, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. under the firms internal country risk management approach, country exposure is reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor are located or where the majority of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (legal residence) or country of incorporation of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor. country exposures are generally measured by considering the firms risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor, with zero recovery. assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain tranched credit derivatives. different measurement approaches or assumptions would affect the amount of reported country exposure.under the firms internal country risk measurement framework:lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and cash and marketable securities collateral receivedsecurities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of collateral receiveddebt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positionscounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivatives fair value, net of the fair value of the related collateral. counterparty exposure on derivatives can change significantly because of market movementscredit derivatives protection purchased and sold is reported based on the underlying reference entity and is measured at the notional amount of protection purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized derivative receivable or payable. credit derivatives protection purchased and sold in the firms market-making activities is measured on a net basis, as such activities often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity; this reflects the manner in which the firm manages these exposures140jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe firm also has indirect exposures to country risk (for example, related to the collateral received on securities financing receivables or related to client clearing activities). these indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through the firms credit, market, and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk management.the firms internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the ffiec bank regulatory requirements. for further information on the ffiecs reporting methodology, see cross-border outstandings on page 327.country risk stress testingthe country risk stress framework aims to identify potential losses arising from a country crisis by capturing the impact of large asset price movements in a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. country risk management periodically defines and runs ad hoc stress scenarios for individual countries in response to specific market events and sector performance concerns.country risk monitoring and controlthe country risk management group establishes guidelines for sovereign ratings reviews and limit management. country stress and nominal exposures are measured under a comprehensive country limit framework. country ratings and limits are actively monitored and reported on a regular basis. country limit requirements are reviewed and approved by senior management as often as necessary, but at least annually. in addition, the country risk management group uses surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns.country risk reportingthe following table presents the firms top 20 exposures by country (excluding the u.s.) as of december31, 2015. the selection of countries is based solely on the firms largest total exposures by country, based on the firms internal country risk management

the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.the firm uses models for many purposes including the valuation of positions and the measurement of risk. valuation models are employed by the firm to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models may be employed as inputs into risk measurement models including var, regulatory capital, estimation of stress loss and the allowance for credit losses.models are owned by various functions within the firm based on the specific purposes of such models. for example, var models and certain regulatory capital models are owned by the line of business-aligned risk management functions. owners of models are responsible for the development, implementation and testing of their models, as well as referral of models to the model risk function for review and approval. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of a robust operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. model owners may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.the model risk review and governance functions review and approve a wide range of models, including risk management, valuation, and regulatory capital models used by the firm. independent of the model owners, the model risk review and governance functions are part of the firms model risk unit, and the firmwide model risk executive reports to the firms cro.models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the firms reliance on the model. this tiering is subject to the approval of the model risk function. a model review conducted by the model risk function considers the models suitability for the specific uses to which it will be put. the factors considered in reviewing a model include whether the model accurately reflects the characteristics of the product and its significant risks, the selection and reliability of model inputs, consistency with models for similar products, the appropriateness of any model-related adjustments, and sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions that cannot be observed from the market. when reviewing a model, the model risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the model risk function based on the relevant tier of the model.under the firms model risk policy, the model risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. in certain circumstances, the head of the model risk function may grant exceptions to the firms model risk policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. the model risk function may also require the owner to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. these actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.for a summary of valuations based on models, see critical accounting estimates used by the firm and note 3.142jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportprincipal risk managementprincipal investments are predominantly privately-held financial assets and instruments, typically representing an ownership or junior capital position, that have unique risks due to their illiquidity or for which there is less observable market or valuation data. such investing activities are typically intended to be held over extended investment periods and, accordingly, the firm has no expectation for short-term gain with respect to these investments. principal investments cover multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. asset classes include tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments), private equity and various debt investments.the firms principal investments are managed under various lines of business and are captured within the respective lobs financial results. the firms approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the firms general risk governance structure. a firmwide risk policy framework exists for all principal investing activities. all investments are approved by investment committees that include executives who are independent from the investing businesses. the firms independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of principal investments in accordance with relevant policies. approved levels for such investments are established for each relevant business in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. industry, geographic, and position level concentration limits are in place and are intended to ensure diversification of the portfolios. the firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report143managements discussion and analysisoperational risk managementoperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events that are neither market- nor credit-related. operational risk is inherent in the firms activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their arrangements. these events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the firm. the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in light of the firms financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.overviewto monitor and control operational risk, the firm maintains an operational risk management framework (ormf) designed to enable the firm to maintain a sound and well-controlled operational environment. the four main components of the ormf include: governance, risk identification and assessment, monitoring and reporting, and measurement.risk management is responsible for prescribing the ormf to the lines of business and corporate functions and for providing independent oversight of its implementation. the lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for implementing the ormf. the firmwide oversight and control group (o&c), which consists of dedicated control officers within each of the lines of business and corporate functional areas, as well as a central oversight team, is responsible for day to day execution of the ormf.operational risk management frameworkthe components of the operational risk management framework are:governancethe firms operational risk governance function reports to the firms cro and is responsible for defining the ormf and establishing the firmwide operational risk management governance structure, policies and standards. the firmwide risk executive for operational risk governance, a direct report of the cro, works with the line of business cros to provide independent oversight of the implementation of the ormf across the firm. operational risk officers (oros), who report to the lob chief risk officers or to the firmwide risk executive for operational risk governance, are independent of the lines of business and corporate functions, and o&c. the oros provide oversight of the implementation of the ormf within in each line of business and corporate function.line of business, corporate function and regional control committees oversee the operational risk and control environments of their respective businesses, functions or regions. these committees escalate operational risk issues to the fcc, as appropriate. for additional information on the firmwide control committee, see enterprise risk management on pages 107111.risk identification and self-assessmentin order to evaluate and monitor operational risk, the lines of business and corporate functions utilize several processes to identify, assess, mitigate and manage operational risk. firmwide standards are in place for each of these processes and set the minimum requirements for how they must be applied.the firms risk and control self-assessment (rcsa) process and supporting architecture requires management to identify material inherent operational risks, assess the design and operating effectiveness of relevant controls in place to mitigate such risks, and evaluate residual risk. action plans are developed for control issues that are identified, and businesses are held accountable for tracking and resolving issues on a timely basis. risk management performs an independent challenge of the rcsa program including residual risk results.the firm also tracks and monitors operational risk events which are analyzed by the responsible businesses and corporate functions. this enables identification of the root causes of the operational risk events and evaluation of the associated controls.furthermore, lines of business and corporate functions establish key risk indicators to manage and monitor operational risk and the control environment. these assist in the early detection and timely escalation of issues or events.risk monitoring and reportingoperational risk management and control reports provide information, including actual operational loss levels, self-assessment results and the status of issue resolution to the lines of business and senior management. in addition, key control indicators and operating metrics are monitored against targets and thresholds. the purpose of these reports is to enable management to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels within each line of business, to escalate issues and to provide consistent data aggregation across the firms businesses and functions.144jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportmeasurementtwo standard forms of operational risk measurement include operational risk capital and operational risk losses under baseline and stressed conditions.the firms operational risk capital methodology incorporates the four required elements of the advanced measurement approach under the basel iii framework:internal losses,external losses,scenario analysis, andbusiness environment and internal control factors.the primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the result of a statistical model, the loss distribution approach (lda), which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk losses based on historical data. the lda model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. the lda model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.the calculation is supplemented by external loss data as needed, as well as both managements view of plausible tail risk, which is captured as part of the scenario analysis process, and evaluation of key lob internal control metrics (beicf). the firm may further supplement such analysis to incorporate feedback from its bank regulators.the firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. the firms operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the firms ccar, icaap and risk appetite processes.for information related to operational risk rwa, ccar or icaap, see capital management section, pages 149158.insuranceone of the ways operational loss may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the firm. the firm purchases insurance to be in compliance with local laws and regulations (e.g., workers compensation), as well as to serve other needs (e.g., property loss and public liability). insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the firm does business. the insurance purchased is reviewed and approved by senior management.cybersecuritythe firm devotes significant resources maintaining and regularly updating its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the firms computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. third parties with which the firm does business or that facilitate the firms business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the firm or result in lost or compromised information of the firm or its clients. in addition, customers with which or whom the firm does business can also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the firm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the firms own security and control systems. customers will generally be responsible for losses incurred due to their own failure to maintain the security of their own systems and processes.the firm and several other u.s. financial institutions have experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced unauthorized parties which are intended to disrupt online banking services. the firm and its clients are also regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses. on september 10, 2014, the firm disclosed that a cyberattack against the firm had occurred. the cyberattacks experienced to date have not resulted in any material disruption to the firms operations nor have they had a material adverse effect on the firms results of operations. the firms board of directors and the audit committee are regularly apprised regarding the cybersecurity policies and practices of the firm as well as the firms efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events.cybersecurity attacks, like the one experienced by the firm, highlight the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government, and the firm continues to work to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses, including the firms third-party service providers, in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats.the firm has established, and continues to establish, defenses to mitigate other possible future attacks. to enhance its defense capabilities, the firm increased cybersecurity spending from approximately $250 million in 2014, to approximately $500 million in 2015, and expects the spending to increase to more than $600 million in 2016. enhancements include more robust testing, advanced analytics, improved technology coverage, strengthened access management and controls and a program to increase employee awareness about cybersecurity risks and best practices.business and technology resiliencyjpmorgan chases global resiliency and crisis management program is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report145managements discussion and analysisbusiness interruption, and to remain in compliance with global laws and regulations as they relate to resiliency risk. the program includes corporate governance, awareness and training, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives aimed to ensure that risks are properly identified, assessed, and managed.the firm has established comprehensive tracking and reporting of resiliency plans in order to proactively anticipate and manage various potential disruptive circumstances such as severe weather and flooding, technology and communications outages, cyber incidents, mass transit shutdowns and terrorist threats, among others. the resiliency measures utilized by the firm include backup infrastructure for data centers, a geographically distributed workforce, dedicated recovery facilities, providing technological capabilities to support remote work capacity for displaced staff and accommodation of employees at alternate locations. jpmorgan chase continues to coordinate its global resiliency program across the firm and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures. the strength and proficiency of the firms global resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the firms business operations during and quickly after various events in 2015 that have resulted in business interruptions, such as severe winter weather and flooding in the u.s. and various global protest-related activities.legal risk managementlegal risk is the risk of loss or imposition of damages, fines, penalties or other liability arising from failure to comply with a contractual obligation or to comply with laws or regulations to which the firm is subject.overviewin addition to providing legal services and advice to the firm, and communicating and helping the lines of business adjust to the legal and regulatory changes they face, including the heightened scrutiny and expectations of the firms regulators, the global legal function is responsible for working with the businesses and corporate functions to fully understand and assess their adherence to laws and regulations. in particular, legal assists oversight & control, risk, finance, compliance and internal audit in their efforts to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and the firms corporate standards for doing business. the firms lawyers also advise the firm on potential legal exposures on key litigation and transactional matters, and perform a significant defense and advocacy role by defending the firm against claims and potential claims and, when needed, pursuing claims against others. governance and oversightthe firms general counsel reports to the ceo and is a member of the operating committee, the firmwide risk committee and the firmwide control committee. the general counsels leadership team includes a general counsel for each line of business, the heads of the litigation and corporate & regulatory practices, as well as the firms corporate secretary. each region (e.g., latin america, asia pacific) has a general counsel who is responsible for managing legal risk across all lines of business and functions in the region.legal works with various committees (including new business initiative and reputation risk committees) and the firms businesses to protect the firms reputation beyond any particular legal requirements. in addition, it advises the firms conflicts office which reviews the firms wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the firm.146jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcompliance risk managementcompliance risk is the risk of failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. overvieweach line of business is accountable for managing its compliance risk. the firms compliance organization (compliance), which is independent of the lines of business, works closely with the operating committee and management to provide independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations applicable to the offering of the firms products and services to clients and customers.these compliance risks relate to a wide variety of legal and regulatory obligations, depending on the line of business and the jurisdiction, and include those related to products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. for example, one compliance risk, fiduciary risk, is the failure to exercise the applicable high standard of care, to act in the best interests of clients or to treat clients fairly, as required under applicable law or regulation. other specific compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the rules and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders, among others. compliance implements various practices designed to identify and mitigate compliance risk by implementing policies, testing and monitoring, training and providing guidance.in recent years, the firm has experienced heightened scrutiny by its regulators of its compliance with regulations, and with respect to its controls and operational processes. in certain instances, the firm has entered into consent orders with its regulators requiring the firm to take certain specified actions to remediate compliance with regulations and improve its controls. the firm expects that such regulatory scrutiny will continue. governance and oversightcompliance is led by the firms chief compliance officer (cco) who reports directly to the firms coo. the firm maintains oversight and coordination in its compliance risk management practices globally through the firms cco, lines of business ccos and regional ccos to implement the compliance program across the lines of business and regions. the firms cco is a member of the firmwide control committee and the firmwide risk committee. the firms cco also provides regular updates to the audit committee and drpc. in addition, from time to time, special committees of the board have been established to oversee the firms compliance with regulatory consent orders. the firm has in place a code of conduct (the code), and each employee is given annual training in respect of the code and is required annually to affirm his or her compliance with the code. the code sets forth the firms core principles and fundamental values, including that no employee should ever sacrifice integrity - or give the impression that he or she has. the code requires prompt reporting of any known or suspected violation of the code, any internal firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the firms business. it also requires the reporting of any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the code, by any of the firms employees, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. specified employees are specially trained and designated as code specialists who act as a resource to employees on code of conduct matters. in addition, concerns may be reported anonymously and the firm prohibits retaliation against employees for the good faith reporting of any actual or suspected violations of the code. the code and the associated employee compliance program are focused on the regular assessment of certain key aspects of the firms culture and conduct initiatives.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report147reputation risk managementreputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment or event will reduce trust in the firms integrity or competence by our various constituents, including clients, counterparties, investors, regulators, employees and the broader public. maintaining the firms reputation is the responsibility of each individual employee of the firm. the firms reputation risk governance policy explicitly vests each employee with the responsibility to consider the reputation of the firm when engaging in any activity. since the types of events that could harm the firms reputation are so varied across the firms lines of business, each line of business has a separate reputation risk governance infrastructure in place, which consists of three key elements: clear, documented escalation criteria appropriate to the business; a designated primary discussion forum  in most cases, one or more dedicated reputation risk committees; and a list of designated contacts, to whom questions relating to reputation risk should be referred. line of business reputation risk governance is overseen by a firmwide reputation risk governance function, which provides oversight of the governance infrastructure and process to support the consistent identification, escalation, management and reporting of reputation risk issues firmwide.148jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcapital managementcapital risk is the risk the firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support the firms business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and stressed conditions.a strong capital position is essential to the firms business strategy and competitive position. the firms capital strategy focuses on long-term stability, which enables the firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment. prior to making any decisions on future business activities, senior management considers the implications on the firms capital. in addition to considering the firms earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to preserving the firms capital strength. maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative by the firms board of directors, ceo and operating committee. the firms balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and reserves, and robust liquidity.the firms capital management objectives are to hold capital sufficient to:cover all material risks underlying the firms business activities;maintain well-capitalized status and meet regulatory capital requirements;retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in its businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments; anddistribute excess capital to shareholders while balancing the other objectives stated above.these objectives are achieved through ongoing monitoring and management of the firms capital position, regular stress testing, and a capital governance framework. capital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. jpmorgan chase has firmwide and lob processes for ongoing monitoring and active management of its capital position. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report149managements discussion and analysisthe following tables present the firms transitional and fully phased-in risk-based and leverage-based

annual reportstrategy and governancethe firms ceo, in conjunction with the board of directors, establishes principles and guidelines for capital planning, issuance, usage and distributions, and establishes capital targets for the level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and highly stressed environments.the firms senior management recognizes the importance of a capital management function that supports strategic decision-making. the capital governance committee and the regulatory capital management office (rcmo) are key components in support of this objective. the capital governance committee is responsible for reviewing the firms capital management policy and the principles underlying capital issuance and distribution alternatives. the committee is also responsible for governing the capital adequacy assessment process, including overall design, assumptions and risk streams, and ensuring that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the idiosyncratic risks across the firms businesses. rcmo, which reports to the firms cfo, is responsible for reviewing, approving and monitoring the implementation of the firms capital policies and strategies, as well as its capital adequacy assessment process. the review assesses the effectiveness of the capital adequacy process, the appropriateness of the risk tolerance levels, and the strength of the control infrastructure. the drpc oversees the firms capital adequacy process and its components. the basel independent review function (bir), which reports to the rcmo and the capital governance committee, conducts independent assessments of the firms regulatory capital framework to ensure compliance with the applicable u.s. basel rules in support of the drpcs and senior managements oversight of the firms capital processes. for additional discussion on the drpc, see enterprise-wide risk management on pages 107111.monitoring and management of capital in its monitoring and management of capital, the firm takes into consideration an assessment of economic risk and all regulatory capital requirements to determine the level of capital needed to meet and maintain the objectives discussed above, as well as to support the framework for allocating capital to its business segments.while economic risk is considered prior to making decisions on future business activities, in most cases, the firm considers risk-based regulatory capital to be a proxy for economic risk capital.regulatory capital the federal reserve establishes capital requirements, including well capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. the occ establishes similar minimum capital requirements for the firms national banks, including jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chasebankusa,n.a. the u.s. capital requirements generally follow the capital accord of the basel committee, as amended from time to time. prior to january 1, 2014, the firm and its banking subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements of basel i and basel 2.5. effective january 1, 2014, the firm became subject to basel iii (which incorporates basel 2.5).basel iii overviewbasel iii capital rules, for large and internationally active u.s. bank holding companies and banks, including the firm and its insured depository institution (idi) subsidiaries, revised, among other things, the definition of capital and introduced a new cet1 capital requirement. basel iii presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating rwa, a general (standardized) approach, which replaced basel i rwa effective january 1, 2015 (basel iii standardized) and an advanced approach, which replaced basel ii rwa (basel iii advanced); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. certain of the requirements of basel iii are subject to phase-in periods that began on january 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (transitional period). the capital adequacy of the firm and its national bank subsidiaries is evaluated against the basel iii approach (standardized or advanced) which results in the lower ratio (the collins floor), as required by the collins amendment of the dodd-frank act.basel iii establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa, and in the case of basel iii advanced, operational risk rwa. key differences in the calculation of credit risk rwa between the standardized and advanced approaches are that for basel iii advanced, credit risk rwa is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for basel iii standardized, credit risk rwa is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. market risk rwa is calculated on a generally consistent basis between basel iii standardized and basel iii advanced, both of which incorporate the requirements set forth in basel 2.5. in addition to the rwa calculated under these methodologies, the firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its bank regulators.basel iii also includes a requirement for advanced approach banking organizations, including the firm, to calculate a supplementary leverage ratio (slr). for additional information on slr, see page 155.   basel iii fully phased-inbasel iii capital rules will become fully phased-in on january 1, 2019, at which point the firm will continue to calculate its capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized and advanced approaches. while the firm has imposed basel iii standardized fully phased-in rwa limits on its lines of business, the firm continues to manage each of the businesses (including line of business equity allocations), as well as the corporate functions, primarily on a basel iii advanced fully phased-in basis.the firms capital, rwa and capital ratios that are presented under basel iii standardized and advanced fully phased-in rules and the firms and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s and chase bank usa, n.a.s slrs calculated under the basel iii advanced fully phased-in rules are non-gaap financial measures. however, such measures are used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess the jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report151managements discussion and analysisfirms capital position and to compare the firms capital to that of other financial services companies.the firms estimates of its basel iii standardized and advanced fully phased-in capital, rwa and capital ratios and of the firms, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s, and chase bank usa, n.a.s slrs reflect managements current understanding of the u.s. basel iii rules based on the current published rules and on the application of such rules to the firms businesses as currently conducted. the actual impact on the firms capital ratios and slr as of the effective date of the rules may differ from the firms current estimates depending on changes the firm may make to its businesses in the future, further implementation guidance from the regulators, and regulatory approval of certain of the firms internal risk models (or, alternatively, regulatory disapproval of the firms internal risk modelsthat have previously been conditionally approved).risk-based capital regulatory minimumsthe following chart presents the basel iii minimum cet1 capital ratio during the transitional periods and on a fully phased-in basis under the basel iii rules currently in effect. at december31, 2015 and 2014, jpmorgan chase maintained basel iii standardized transitional and basel iii advanced transitional capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the federal reserve. additional information regarding the firms capital ratios, as well as the u.s. federal regulatory capital standards to which the firm is subject, is presented in note 28. for further information on the firms basel iii measures, see the firms pillar 3 regulatory capital disclosures reports, which are available on the firms website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm).all banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum capital ratio of 4.5% of cet1 capital. certain banking organizations, including the firm, will be required to hold additional amounts of capital to serve as a capital conservation buffer. the capital conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb potential losses in times of financial or economic stress. if not maintained, the firm could be limited in the amount of capital that may be distributed, including dividends and common equity repurchases. the capital conservation buffer is to be phased-in over time, beginning january 1, 2016 through january 1, 2019. when fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer requires an additional 2.5% of cet1 capital, as well as additional levels of capital in the form of a gsib surcharge and the recently implemented countercyclical capital buffer. on july 20, 2015, the federal reserve issued a final rule requiring gsibs to calculate their gsib surcharge, on an annual basis, under two separately prescribed methods, and to be subject to the higher of the two. the first method (method 1) reflects the gsib surcharge as prescribed by basel rules, and is calculated across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. the second method (method 2) modifies the requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a gsib score multiplication factor. based upon data as of december 31, 2015, the firm estimates its fully phased-in gsib surcharge would be 2% of cet1 capital under method 1 and 3.5% under method 2. on july 20, 2015, the date of the last published estimate, the federal reserve had estimated the firms gsib surcharge to be 2.5% under method 1 and 4.5% under method 2 as of december 31, 2014. 152jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe countercyclical capital buffer is a potential expansion of the capital conservation buffer that takes into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. as of december 31, 2015 the federal reserve reaffirmed setting the u.s. countercyclical capital buffer at 0%, and stated that it will review the amount at least annually. the countercyclical capital buffer can be increased if the federal reserve, fdic and occ determine that credit growth in the economy has become excessive and can be set at up to an additional 2.5% of rwa. on december 21, 2015, the federal reserve, in conjunction with the fdic and occ, requested public comment, due march 21, 2016, on a proposed policy statement detailing the framework that would be followed in setting the u.s. basel iii countercyclical capital buffer. based on the firms most recent estimate of its gsib surcharge and the current countercyclical buffer being set at 0%, the firm estimates its fully phased-in capital conservation buffer would be 6%. as well as meeting the capital ratio requirements of basel iii, the firm must, in order to be well-capitalized, maintain a minimum 6% tier 1 and a 10% total capital requirement. each of the firms idi subsidiaries must maintain a minimum 5% tier 1 leverage, 6.5% cet1, 8% tier 1 and 10% total capital standard to meet the definition of well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action (pca) requirements of the fdic improvement act(fdicia) for idi subsidiaries. the pca standards for idi subsidiaries were effective january 1, 2015.a reconciliation of total stockholders equity to basel iii standardized and advanced fully phased-in cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and

off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.on september 3, 2014, the u.s. banking regulators adopted a final rule for the calculation of the slr. the u.s. final rule requires public disclosure of the slr beginning with the first quarter of 2015, and also requires u.s. bank holding companies, including the firm, to have a minimum slr of 5% and idi subsidiaries, including jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chasebankusa,n.a., to have a minimum slr of 6%, both beginning january 1, 2018. as of december 31, 2015, the firm estimates that jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s and chase bank usa, n.a.s fully phased-in slrs are approximately 6.6% and 8.3%, respectively. the following table presents the components of the firms fully phased-in slr, a non-gaap

large bank holding companies, including the firm, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses the ccar and dodd-frank act stress test processes to ensure that large bank holding companies have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each bank holding companys (bhc) unique risks to enable them to have the ability to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. through the ccar, the federal reserve evaluates each bhcs capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes, as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.on march 11, 2015, the federal reserve informed the firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the firms 2015 capital plan. for information on actions taken by the firms board of directors following the 2015 ccar results, see capital actions on page 157.for 2016, the federal reserve revised the capital plan cycle for the ccar process. under the revised time line, the firm is required to submit its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve by april 5, 2016. the federal reserve has indicated that it expects to respond to the capital plan submissions of bank holding companies by june 30, 2016.the firms ccar process is integrated into and employs the same methodologies utilized in the firms icaap process, as discussed below.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report155managements discussion and analysisinternal capital adequacy assessment processsemiannually, the firm completes the icaap, which provides management with a view of the impact of severe and unexpected events on earnings, balance sheet positions, reserves and capital. the firms icaap integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning.the process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the firms earnings and capital. economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. these scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. the scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the firm. however, when defining a broad range of scenarios, realized events can always be worse. accordingly, management considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. icaap results are reviewed by management and the board of directors.line of business equitythe firms framework for allocating capital to its business segments (line of business equity) is based on the following objectives:integrate firmwide and line of business capital management activities;measure performance consistently across all lines of business; andprovide comparability with peer firms for each of the lines of business.each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under basel iii advanced fully phased-in) and economic risk. capital is also allocated to each line of business for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. roe is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segments performance.line of business equityyearly averageyear ended december 31,(in billions)201520142013consumer & community banking$51.0$51.0$46.0corporate

establishes the criteria for tlac eligible debt and capital instruments and defines the minimum requirements for amounts of loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity. this amount and type of debt and capital instruments is intended to effectively absorb losses, as necessary, upon the failure of a gsib, without imposing such losses on taxpayers of the relevant jurisdiction or causing severe systemic disruptions, and thereby ensuring the continuity ofthe gsibs critical functions. the final standard will require gsibs to meet a common minimum tlac requirement of 16% of the financial institutions rwa, effective january 1, 2019, and at least 18% effective january 1, 2022. the minimum tlac must also be at least 6% of a financial institutions basel iii leverage ratio denominator, effective january 1, 2019, and at least 6.75% effective january 1, 2022.on october 30, 2015, the federal reserve issued proposed rules that would require the top-tier holding companies of eight u.s. global systemically important bank holding companies, including the firm, among other things, to maintain minimum levels of eligible tlac and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria (eligible ltd) commencing january 1, 2019. under the proposal, these eight u.s gsibs would be required to maintain minimumtlac of no less than 18% of the financial institutions rwa or 9.5% of its leverage exposure (as defined by the rules), plus in the case of the rwa-based measure,a tlac buffer that is equal to 2.5% of the financial institutions cet1, any applicable countercyclical buffer and the financial institutions gsib surcharge as calculated under method 1. the minimum level of eligible ltd that would be required to be maintained by these eight u.s. gsibs would be equal to the greater of (a) 6% of the financial institutions rwa, plus the higher of the method 1 or method 2 gsib surcharge applicable to the institution and (b) 4.5% of its leverage exposure (as defined by the rules). these proposed tlac rules would disqualify from eligible ltd, among other instruments, senior debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as structured notes and debt securities not governed by u.s. law. the firm is currently evaluating the impact of the proposal.156jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcapital actionsdividends

would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity  for example, during internal trading blackout periods. all purchases under a rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.the authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. the repurchase program does not include specific price

are jpmorgan securities and j.p. morgan clearing corp. (jpmorgan clearing). jpmorganclearing is a subsidiary of jpmorgan securities and provides clearing and settlement services. jpmorgan securities and jpmorgan clearing are each subject to rule 15c3-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (the net capital rule). jpmorgan securities and jpmorgan clearing are also each registered as futures commission merchants and subject to rule 1.17 of the commodity futures trading commission (cftc).jpmorgan securities and jpmorgan clearing have elected to compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements of the net capital rule. at december 31, 2015, jpmorgansecurities net capital, as defined by the net capital rule, was $14.2 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $11.9 billion, and jpmorgan clearings net capital was $7.7 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $6.2 billion.in addition to its minimum net capital requirement, jpmorgan securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the securities and exchange commission (sec) in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0billion, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of appendix e of the net capital rule. as of december 31, 2015, jpmorgan securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.j.p. morgan securities plc is a wholly owned subsidiary of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.and is the firms principal operating subsidiary inthe u.k. it has authority to engage in banking,investment banking and broker-dealer activities. j.p.morgansecuritiesplc is jointly regulated by the u.k. prudential regulation authority (pra) and financial conduct authority (fca). commencing january 1, 2014, j.p. morgan securities plc became subject to the u.k. basel iii capital rules.at december 31, 2015, j.p. morgan securities plc had estimated total capital of $33.9 billion; its estimated cet1 capital ratio was 15.4% and its estimated total capital ratio was 19.6%. both capital ratios exceeded the minimum standards of 4.5% and 8.0%, respectively, under the transitional requirements of the european unions (eu) basel iii capital requirements directive and regulation, as well as the additional capital requirements specified by the pra.158jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportliquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk that the firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets.liquidity risk oversightthe firm has a liquidity risk oversight function whose primary objective is to provide assessment, measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity risk across the firm. liquidity risk oversight is managed through a dedicated firmwide liquidity risk oversight group. the ctc cro, as part of the independent risk management function, has responsibility for firmwide liquidity risk oversight. liquidity risk oversights responsibilities include but are not limited to:establishing and monitoring limits, indicators, and thresholds, including liquidity appetite tolerances;defining, monitoring, and reporting internal firmwide and legal entity stress tests, and monitoring and reporting regulatory defined stress testing;monitoring and reporting liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities;conducting ad hoc analysis to identify potential emerging liquidity risks.risk governance and measurementspecific committees responsible for liquidity governance include firmwide alco as well as line of business and regional alcos, and the ctc risk committee. for further discussion of the risk and risk-related committees, see enterprise-wide risk management on pages 107111.internal stress testingliquidity stress tests are intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the firm under a variety of adverse scenarios. results of stress tests are therefore considered in the formulation of the firms funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time horizons and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stress. standard stress tests are performed on a regular basis and ad hoc stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. stress scenarios are produced for jpmorgan chase & co. (parent company) and the firms major subsidiaries.liquidity stress tests assume all of the firms contractual obligations are met and then take into consideration varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets. additionally, assumptions with respect to potential non-contractual and contingent outflows are contemplated.liquidity managementtreasury is responsible for liquidity management. the primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the firms core businesses are able to operate in support of client needs, meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and to manage optimal funding mix, and availability of liquidity sources. the firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach in order to optimize liquidity sources and uses.in the context of the firms liquidity management, treasury is responsible for:analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the firm, lines of business and legal entities assets and liabilities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;defining and monitoring firmwide and legal entity liquidity strategies, policies, guidelines, and contingency funding plans;managing liquidity within approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.contingency funding planthe firms contingency funding plan (cfp), which is reviewed by alco and approved by the drpc, is a compilation of procedures and action plans for managing liquidity through stress events. the cfp incorporates the limits and indicators set by the liquidity risk oversight group. these limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify the emergence of risks or vulnerabilities in the firms liquidity position. the cfp identifies the alternative contingent liquidity resources available to the firm in a stress event.parent company and subsidiary fundingthe parent company acts as a source of funding to its subsidiaries. the firms liquidity management is intended to maintain liquidity at the parent company, in addition to funding and liquidity raised at the subsidiary operating level, at levels sufficient to fund the operations of the parent company and its subsidiaries for an extended period of time in a stress environment where access to normal funding sources is disrupted. the parent company currently holds sufficient liquidity to withstand peak outflows over a one year liquidity stress horizon, assuming no access to wholesale funding markets.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report159managements discussion and analysislcr and nsfrthe firm must comply with the u.s. lcr rule, which is intended to measure the amount of hqla held by the firm in relation to estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period during an acute stress event. the lcr is required to be 80% at january 1, 2015, increasing by 10% each year until reaching the 100% minimum by january 1, 2017. at december 31, 2015, the firm was compliant with the fully phased-in u.s. lcr. on october 31, 2014, the basel committee issued the final standard for the net stable funding ratio (nsfr)  which is intended to measure the available amount of stable funding relative to the required amount of stable funding over a one-year horizon. nsfr will become a minimum standard by january 1, 2018 and requires that this ratio be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. at december 31, 2015, the firm was compliant with the nsfr based on its current understanding of the final basel rule. the u.s. banking regulators are expected to issue an npr that would outline requirements specific to u.s. banks.hqlahqla is the amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the u.s. lcr. hqla primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality liquid assets as defined in the final rule.as of december31, 2015, the firms hqla was $496 billion, compared with $600 billion as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in hqla was due to lower cash balances largely driven by lower non-operating deposit balances; however, the firm remains lcr-compliant given the corresponding reduction in estimated net cash outflows associated with those deposits. hqla may fluctuate from period to period primarily due to normal flows from client activity.the following table presents the estimated hqla included in the lcr broken out by hqla-eligible cash and securities as of december31, 2015.(in billions)december 31, 2015hqlaeligible cash(a)$304eligible securities(b)192total hqla$496(a)cash on deposit at central banks.(b)predominantly includes u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, u.s. treasuries, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under u.s. lcr rules.in addition to hqla, as of december31, 2015, the firm has approximately $249 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. furthermore, the firm maintains borrowing capacity at various federal home loan banks (fhlbs), the federal reserve bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the firm to such banks. although available, the firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. as of december31, 2015, the firms remaining borrowing capacity at various fhlbs and the federal reserve bank discount window was approximately $183 billion. this remaining borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities included above in hqla or other unencumbered securities currently held at the federal reserve bank discount window for which the firm has not drawn liquidity.fundingsources of fundsmanagement believes that the firms unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.the firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. the firms loan portfolio ($837.3 billion at december31, 2015), is funded with a portion of the firms deposits ($1,279.7 billion at december31, 2015) andthroughsecuritizations and, with respect to a portion of the firms real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the fhlbs.deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the firms investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets- debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the firms securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilitiesdebt and equity instruments, and a portion of the firms long-term debt and stockholders equity. in addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the firms debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the firms investment securities portfolio. see the discussion below for additional information relating to deposits, short-term funding, and long-term funding and issuance.160jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportdepositsa key strength of the firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. as of december31, 2015, the firms loans-to-deposits ratio was 65%, compared with 56% at december31, 2014.as of december31, 2015, total deposits for the firm were $1,279.7 billion, compared with $1,363.4 billion at december31, 2014 (61% and 58% of total liabilities at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively). the decrease was attributable to lower wholesale non-operating deposits, partially offset by higher consumer deposits. for further information, see consolidated balance sheet analysis on pages 7576.the firm has typically experienced higher customer deposit inflows at quarter-ends. therefore, the firm believes average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends. the table below summarizes, by line of business, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended december31, 2015 and 2014.depositsyear ended december 31,as of or for the period ended

deposits are consumer deposits, which are considered a stable source of liquidity. additionally, the majority of the firms wholesale operating deposits are also considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the firm. wholesale non-operating deposits, including a portion of balances previously reported as commercial paper sweep liabilities, decreased by approximately $200 billion from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015, predominantly driven by the firms actions to reduce such deposits. the reduction has not had a significant impact on the firms liquidity position as discussed under lcr and hqla above. for further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of

the discontinuation of its commercial paper customer sweep cash management program. this change has not had a significant impact on the firms liquidity as the majority of these customer funds remain as deposits at the firm.the firms sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency mbs, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheets. the decrease in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at december31, 2015, compared with the balance at december 31, 2014 (as well as the average balances for the full year 2015, compared with the prior year) was due to a decline in secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments in cib. the balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers investment and financing activities; the firms demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the firms liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.long-term funding and issuancelong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the firm. the firms long-term funding plan is driven by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements. long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs, as well as maintaining a certain level of liquidity at the parent company. the firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.the significant

discussion and analysiscredit ratingsthe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the firms access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the firm. additionally, the firms funding requirements for vies and other third party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for vies, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see special-purpose entities on page 77, and credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in note

notches could result in an increase in its cost of funds, and access to certain funding markets could be reduced as noted above. the nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors (which the firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). the firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.jpmorgan chases unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the firms credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the firms credit ratings.in may 2015, moodys published its new bank rating methodology. as part of this action, the firms preferred stock, deposits and bank subordinated debt ratings were upgraded by one notch. additionally in may 2015, fitch changed its bank ratings methodology, implementing ratings differentiation between bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. this resulted in a one notch upgrade to the issuer ratings, senior debt ratings and long-term deposit ratings of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., and certain other subsidiaries. in december 2015, s&p removed from its ratings for u.s. gsibs the uplift assumption due to extraordinary government support. as a result, the firms short-term and long-term senior unsecured debt ratings and its subordinated unsecured debt ratings were lowered by one notch.although the firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage, to the extent it is able, factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be changed in the future.164jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcritical accounting estimates used by the firmjpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. the methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios. in addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.allowance for credit lossesjpmorgan chases allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the firms wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. the allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the firms loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date.the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, a formula-based component, and a component related to pci loans. the determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters, as discussed below. for further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firms allowance for credit losses, see note 15.asset-specific componentthe asset-specific allowance for loan losses for each of the firms portfolio segments is generally measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the impaired loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate. estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as redefault rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. these estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the level of future home prices, the duration of current overall economic conditions, and other macroeconomic and portfolio-specific factors. all of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.formula-based component  consumer loans and lending-related commitments, excluding pci loansthe formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including credit card, is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors to outstanding principal balances over an estimated loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses in the portfolio. the loss emergence period represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss (through a charge-off). estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. in addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. management uses additional statistical methods and considers portfolio and collateral valuation trends to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate.the statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. however, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, the potential impact of payment recasts within the heloc portfolio, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. in certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. for example, the performance of a heloc that experiences a payment recast may be affected by both the quality of underwriting standards applied in originating the loan and the general economic conditions in effect at the time of the payment recast. for junior lien products, management considers the delinquency and/or modification status of any senior liens in determining the adjustment. the application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the consumer credit portfolio.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report165managements discussion and analysisoverall, the allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including credit card, is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), fico scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. while all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in the other. in addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both.pci loansin connection with the washington mutual transaction, jpmorgan chase acquired certain pci loans, which are accounted for as described in note 14. the allowance for loan losses for the pci portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans.these cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. these estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home price declines, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.formula-based component  wholesale loans and lending-related commitmentsthe firms methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. the formula-based component of the allowance calculation for wholesale loans and lending-related components is the product of an estimated pd and estimated lgd. these factors are determined based on the credit quality and specific attributes of the firms loans and lending-related commitments to each obligor. the firm assesses the credit quality of its borrower or counterparty and assigns a risk rating. risk ratings are assigned at origination or acquisition, and if necessary, adjusted for changes in credit quality over the life of the exposure. in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan or lending-related commitment, among the factors considered are the obligors debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligors earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. these factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. determining risk ratings involves significant judgment; emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by the firm.pd estimates are based on observable external through-the-cycle data, using credit rating agency default statistics. a lgd estimate is assigned to each loan or lending-related commitment. the estimate represents the amount of economic loss if the obligor were to default. the type of obligor, quality of collateral, and the seniority of the firms lending exposure in the obligors capital structure affect lgd. lgd estimates are based on the firms history of actual credit losses over more than one credit cycle. changes to the time period used for pd and lgd estimates (for example, point-in-time loss versus longer views of the credit cycle) could also affect the allowance for credit losses.the firm applies judgment in estimating pd and lgd used in calculating the allowances. wherever possible, the firm uses independent, verifiable data or the firms own historical loss experience in its models for estimating the allowances, but differences in characteristics between the firms specific loans or lending-related commitments and those reflected in external and firm-specific historical data could affect loss estimates. estimates of pd and lgd are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external and firm-specific historical data. the use of different inputs would change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the firm.management also applies its judgment to adjust the modeled loss estimates, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors. historical experience of both lgd and pd are considered when estimating these adjustments. factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. these estimates are based on managements view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio.allowance for credit losses sensitivityas noted above, the firms allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. changes in economic conditions or in the firms assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. the firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external and firm-specific historical data. in many cases, the use of alternate estimates (for example, the effect of home prices and unemployment rates 166jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reporton consumer delinquency, or the calibration between the firms wholesale loan risk ratings and external credit ratings) or data sources (for example, external pd and lgd factors that incorporate industry-wide information, versus firm-specific history) would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. to illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the firms modeled loss estimates as of december31, 2015, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the firms allowance for loan losses:for pci loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 1% increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $700 million.for the residential real estate portfolio, excluding pci loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 1% increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual loss estimates of approximately $125 million.a 50 basis point deterioration in forecasted credit card loss rates could imply an increase to modeled annualized credit card loan loss estimates of approximately $600 million.an increase in pd factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the firms internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the firms modeled loss estimates of approximately $2.1 billion.a 100 basis point increase in estimated lgd for the firms entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the firms modeled loss estimates of approximately $175 million.the purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. the changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply managements expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. in addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. in addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. given the process the firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate.fair value of financial instruments, msrs and commodities inventoryjpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.assets measured at fair valuethe following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within

further information, see note 3.(a)for purposes of table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.9 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustmentas such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. however, if the firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables balance would be $546 million at december31, 2015; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(b)private equity instruments represent investments within the corporate line of business. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report167managements discussion and analysisvaluationdetails of the firms processes for determining fair value are set out in note 3. estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm. for instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. for further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see note 3.for instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the firms credit-worthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. for further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm see note 3.imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. furthermore, while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios.the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see note 3.goodwill impairmentunder u.s. gaap, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. the firms process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in note 17.management applies significant judgment when estimating the fair value of its reporting units. estimates of fair value are dependent upon estimates of (a) the future earnings potential of the firms reporting units, including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, such as the dodd-frank act, (b) long-term growth rates and (c) the relevant cost of equity. imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units.based upon the updated valuations for all of its reporting units, the firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired at december 31, 2015. the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 10% - 180% for all reporting units and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.the goodwill of $101 million remaining as of december 31, 2014 associated with the private equity business was disposed of as part of the private equity sale completed in january 2015. for further information on the private equity sale, see note 2.the projections for all of the firms reporting units are consistent with managements short-term business outlook assumptions, and in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the firms best estimates of long-term growth and returns on equity of its businesses. where possible, the firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the firms reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.for additional information on goodwill, see note 17.168jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportincome taxesjpmorgan chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including u.s. federal, state and local and non-u.s. jurisdictions. these laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. to determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, jpmorgan chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the u.s. and non-u.s. tax jurisdictions.jpmorgan chases interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. these disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates. jpmorgan chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the firm records additional reserves as appropriate. in addition, the firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations and tax planning strategies. it is possible that revisions in the firms estimate of income taxes may materially affect the firms results of operations in any reporting period.the firms provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. deferred tax assets are recognized if, in managements judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. the firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain net operating losses (nols) and tax credits. the firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize nols before they expire. in connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. the valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. as of december31, 2015, management has determined it is more likely than not that the firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.jpmorgan chase does not record u.s. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. changes to the income tax rates applicable to these non-u.s. subsidiaries may have a material impact on the effective tax rate in a future period if such changes were to occur.the firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available. uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. it is possible that the reassessment of jpmorgan chases unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.for additional information on income taxes, see note 26.litigation reservesfor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see

to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  basis of presentationjpmorgan chase & co. (jpmorgan chase or the firm), a financial holding company incorporated under delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the united states of america (u.s.), with operations worldwide. the firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. for a discussion of the firms business segments, see note 33.the accounting and financial reporting policies of jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap). additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of jpmorgan chase and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the firm are not assets of jpmorgan chase and are not included on the consolidated balance sheets.the firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (vie).voting interest entitiesvoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations. for these types of entities, the firms determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the firm control, are consolidated by the firm.investments in companies in which the firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i)in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entitys net earnings), or (ii)at fair value if the fair value option was elected. these investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in other income.certain firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. for many of these entities, the firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. accordingly, the firm does not consolidate these funds. in the limited cases where the nonaffiliated partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the firm consolidates the funds.the firms investment companies have investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. these investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets.variable interest entities vies are entities that, by design, either (1)lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.the most common type of vie is a special purpose entity (spe). spes are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. the basic spe structure involves a company selling assets to the spe; the spe funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. the legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the spes investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. spes are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the spes assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.the primary beneficiary of a vie (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the vie. the primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the vie, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.to assess whether the firm has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance, the firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the vie and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. this assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report181notes to consolidated financial statementsactivities. in general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the vie (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the vies assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a vie.to assess whether the firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie, the firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the vie. this assessment requires that the firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the vie. factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the vie, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the vies capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the firm.the firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become vies, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the vie consolidation framework; and (2)whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the firms involvement with a vie cause the firms consolidation conclusion to change.in february 2010, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an amendment which deferred the requirements of the accounting guidance for vies for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. for the funds to which the deferral applies, the firm continues to apply other existing authoritative accounting guidance to determine whether such funds should be consolidated. use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statementsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could be different from these estimates. foreign currency translationjpmorgan chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-u.s. currencies into u.s. dollars using applicable exchange rates.gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for u.s. reporting are included in other comprehensive income/(loss) (oci) within stockholders equity. gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-u.s. operations where the functional currency is the u.s. dollar, are reported in the consolidated statements of income. offsetting assets and liabilitiesu.s. gaap permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. u.s. gaap also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. the firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.the firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivatives transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned agreements. a master netting agreement is a single contract with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that contract to be terminated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due after expiration of any grace period). upon the exercise of termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive value or in the money transactions are netted against the negative value or out of the money transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. upon exercise of repurchase agreement and securities loan default rights in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.182jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reporttypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the demanding party). the collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. the collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. it also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. for further discussion of the firms derivative instruments, see note 6. for further discussion of the firms repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, see note 13.simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costseffective october 1, 2015, the firm early adopted new accounting guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs, by requiring that unamortized debt issuance costs be presented as a reduction of the applicable liability rather than as an asset. the adoption of this guidance had no material impact on the firms consolidated balance sheets, and no impact on the firms consolidated results of operations. the guidance was required to be applied retrospectively, and accordingly, certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.investments in qualified affordable housing projectseffective january 1, 2015, the firm adopted new accounting guidance for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit, which impacted the corporate & investment bank (cib). as a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the firm made an accounting policy election to amortize the initial cost of its qualifying investments in proportion to the tax credits and other benefits received, and to present the amortization as a component of income tax expense; previously such amounts were predominantly presented in other income. the guidance was required to be applied retrospectively, and accordingly, certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. the cumulative effect on retained earnings was a reduction of $284 million as of january 1, 2013. the adoption of this accounting guidance resulted in an increase of $907 million and $924 million in other income and income tax expense, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $761 million and $798 million, respectively, for the year ended december 2013, which led to an increase of approximately 2% in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the impact on net income and earnings per share in the periods affected was not material. for further information, see note 26.statements of cash flowsfor jpmorgan chases consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks.

equity saleas part of the firms business simplification agenda, the sale of a portion of the private equity business (private equity sale) was completed on january 9, 2015. concurrent with the sale, a new independent management company was formed by the former one equity partners investment professionals. the new management company provides investment management services to the acquirer of the investments sold in the private equity sale and to the firm for the portion of the private equity investments that were retained by the firm. the sale of the investments did not have a material impact on the firms consolidated balance sheets or its results of operations.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report183notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 3  fair value measurementjpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. these assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the firms consolidated balance sheets). certain assets (e.g., certain mortgage, home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral), liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. if listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on models that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs observable or unobservable market parameters, including but not limited to yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. the level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. furthermore, while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios. the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. the use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. valuation processrisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the firms valuation control function, which is part of the firms finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the firms positions are recorded at fair value. in addition, the firmwide valuation governance forum (vgf) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the firm. the vgf is chaired by the firmwide head of the valuation control function (under the direction of the firms chief financial officer (cfo)), and includes sub-forums covering the corporate & investment bank, consumer & community banking (ccb), commercial banking, asset management and certain corporate functions including treasury and chief investment office (cio).the valuation control function verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. where independent prices or inputs are not available, additional review is performed by the valuation control function to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. the review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking of valuation inputs to those for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. there are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.the valuation control function determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. no adjustments are applied to the quoted market price for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (see below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). for other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. the determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the firm:liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. liquidity valuation adjustments are applied and determined based on current market conditions. factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. the firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by u.s. gaap, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.184jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportunobservable parameter valuation adjustments may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. unobservable parameter valuation adjustments are applied to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. where appropriate, the firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality, the firms own creditworthiness and the impact of funding, utilizing a consistent framework across the firm. for more information on such adjustments see credit and funding adjustments on page 200 of this note.valuation model review and approval if prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction data such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs to those models. the model risk function is independent of the model owners. it reviews and approves a wide range of models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models used by the firm. the model risk review and governance functions are part of the firms model risk unit, and the firmwide model risk executive reports to the firms chief risk officer (cro). when reviewing a model, the model risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology, and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. new valuation models, as well as material changes to existing valuation models, are reviewed and approved prior to implementation except where specified conditions are met, including the approval of an exception granted by the head of the model risk function. the model risk function performs an annual status assessment that considers developments in the product or market to determine whether valuation models which have already been reviewed need to be, on a full or partial basis, reviewed and approved again.valuation hierarchy a three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under u.s. gaap for disclosure of fair value measurements. the valuation hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. the three levels are defined as follows. level 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.level 3  one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual

guidance for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). as a result of the adoption of this new guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of which $337 million and $1.2 billion had been previously classified in level 2 and level 3, respectively, at december 31, 2014. included on the firms balance sheet at december 31, 2015 and 2014, were trading assets of $61 million and $124 million, respectively, and other assets of $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. the guidance was required to be applied retrospectively, and accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.190jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report(a)at december31, 2015 and 2014, included total u.s. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $67.0 billion and $84.1 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)at december31, 2015 and 2014, included within trading loans were $11.8 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $4.3 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to u.s. government agencies of $5.3 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.(c)physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. market is a term defined in u.s. gaap as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (transaction costs). transaction costs for the firms physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. therefore, market approximates fair value for the firms physical commodities inventories. when fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. for a further discussion of the firms hedge accounting relationships, see note 6. to provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).(e)as permitted under u.s. gaap, the firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. for purposes of the tables above, the firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. however, if the firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables and payables balances would be $546 million and $2.5 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(f)private equity instruments represent investments within the corporate line of business. the cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $3.5 billion and $6.0 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.(g)certain prior period amounts (including the corresponding fair value parenthetical disclosure for accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets) were revised to conform with the current period presentation.transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisfor the years ended december31, 2015 and 2014, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2.during the year ended december31, 2015, transfers from level 3 to level 2 and from level 2 to level 3 included the following:$3.1 billion of long-term debt and $1.0 billion of deposits driven by an increase in observability on certain structured notes with embedded interest rate and fx derivatives and a reduction of the significance in the unobservable inputs for certain structured notes with embedded equity derivatives$2.1 billion of gross equity derivatives for both receivables and payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance in unobservable inputs; partially offset by transfers into level 3 resulting in net transfers of approximately $1.2 billion for both receivables and payables$2.8 billion of trading loans driven by an increase in observability of certain collateralized financing transactions; and $2.4 billion of corporate debt driven by a decrease in the significance in the unobservable inputs and an increase in observability for certain structured productsduring the year ended december31, 2014, transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following:$4.3 billion and $4.4 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and payables, respectively, due to increased observability of certain equity option valuation inputs$2.7 billion of trading loans, $2.6 billion of margin loans, $2.3 billion of private equity investments, $2.0 billion of corporate debt, and $1.3 billion of long-term debt, based on increased liquidity and price transparencytransfers from level 2 into level 3 included $1.1 billion of other borrowed funds, $1.1 billion of trading loans and $1.0 billion of long-term debt, based on a decrease in observability of valuation inputs and price transparency.during the year ended december31, 2013, transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following: certain highly rated clos, including $27.4 billion held in the firms available-for-sale (afs) securities portfolio and $1.4 billion held in the trading portfolio, based on increased liquidity and price transparency; $1.3 billion of long-term debt, largely driven by an increase in observability of certain equity structured notes. transfers from level 2 to level 3 included $1.4 billion of corporate debt securities in the trading portfolio largely driven by a decrease in observability for certain credit instruments.all transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. level 3 valuationsthe firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). for further information on the firms valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see pages 185188 of this note. estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm. for instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, but not limited to, transaction details, yield jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report191notes to consolidated financial statementscurves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. the following table presents the firms primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. while the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. the level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. in addition, the firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. the range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. in the firms view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the firms estimates and assumptions. rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. for example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. the input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the firm at each balance sheet date. for the firms derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at december 31, 2015, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range presented; equities correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range; the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented; and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the top end of the range presented. in addition, the interest rate volatility inputs and the foreign exchange correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were each concentrated at the upper end of the range presented. the equity volatilities are concentrated in the lower half end of the range. the forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated within the lower end of the range presented. 192jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual

receivables and $401 million of credit derivative payables with underlying asset-backed securities risk have been included in the inputs and ranges provided for corporate debt securities, obligations of u.s. states and municipalities and other.(d)long-term debt, other borrowed funds and deposits include structured notes issued by the firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. the estimation of the fair value of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instruments. the significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(e)  the parameters are related to residential mortgage-backed securities.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report193notes to consolidated financial statementschanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs the following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. the impact of changes in inputs may not be independent as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input; where relationships exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. in addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. in addition, the following discussion provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the firms positions. yield  the yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. an increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. credit spread  the credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. the credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. the yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. the yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the firm. the risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower fico scores, loan-to-value ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. for corporate debt securities, obligations of u.s. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. prepayment speed  the prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. an increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. conditional default rate  the conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. while there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. an increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. an increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. based on the types of securities owned in the firms market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. loss severity  the loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. an increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. an increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. the loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the loan-to-value ratio, the nature of the lenders lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors. 194jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcorrelation  correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables (e.g., how the change in one variable influences the change in the other). correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange) due to the nature of the underlying risks. when parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. when parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. an increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. the range of correlation inputs between risks within the same asset class are generally narrower than those between underlying risks across asset classes. in addition, the ranges of credit correlation inputs tend to be narrower than those affecting other asset classes.the level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. for example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. volatility  volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. ebitda multiple  ebitda multiples refer to the input (often derived from the value of a comparable company) that is multiplied by the historic and/or expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) of a company in order to estimate the companys value. an increase in the ebitda multiple, in isolation, net of adjustments, would result in an increase in a fair value measurement.changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements the following tables include a rollforward of the consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. when a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. however, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. also, the firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the firms risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report195notes to consolidated financial statementsfair value measurements using significant unobservable inputsyear

level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 1.4% of total firm assets at december31, 2015. the following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since december 31, 2014, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on pages 200201.for the year ended december31, 2015level 3 assets were $31.2 billion at december31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of $18.0 billion from december 31, 2014. this decrease was driven by settlements (including repayments and restructurings) and transfers to level 2 due to an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. in particular:$10.6 billion decrease in trading assets  debt and equity instruments was driven by a decrease of $6.7 billion in trading loans due to sales, maturities and transfers from level 3 to level 2 as a result of an increase in observability of certain valuation inputs and a $2.3 billion decrease in corporate debt securities due to transfers from level 3 to level 2 as a result of an increase in observability of certain valuation inputs$4.6 billion decrease in gross derivative receivables was driven by a $3.9 billion decrease in equity,

value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record adjustments to the firms estimates of fair value in order to reflect counterparty credit quality, the firms own creditworthiness, and the impact of funding:cva is taken to reflect the credit quality of a counterparty in the valuation of derivatives. derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. these market parameters may not consider counterparty non-performance risk. therefore, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the credit quality of each derivative counterparty to arrive at fair value.the firm estimates derivatives cva using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected credit exposure across all of the firms positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses as a result of a counterparty credit event. the key inputs to this methodology are (i) the expected positive exposure to each counterparty based on a simulation that assumes the current population of existing derivatives with each counterparty remains unchanged and considers contractual factors designed to mitigate the firms credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset; (ii) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated cds spreads; and (iii) estimated recovery rates implied by cds, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in cds spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. as such, the firm estimates derivatives cva relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate.dva is taken to reflect the credit quality of the firm in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value. the dva calculation methodology is generally consistent with the cva methodology described above and incorporates jpmorgan chases credit spreads as observed through the cds market to estimate the probability of default and loss given default as a result of a systemic event affecting the firm. structured notes dva is estimated using the current fair value of the structured note as the exposure amount, and is otherwise consistent with the derivative dva methodology. fva is taken to incorporate the impact of funding in the firms valuation estimates where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. for collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap (ois) rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty. for uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (otc) derivatives and structured notes, effective in 2013, the firm implemented a fva framework to incorporate the impact of funding into its valuation estimates. the firms fva framework leverages its existing cva and dva calculation methodologies, and considers the fact that the firms own credit risk is a significant component of funding costs. the key inputs to fva are: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the firms positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; (ii) for assets, the estimated market funding cost in the principal market; and (iii) for liabilities, the hypothetical market funding cost for a transfer to a market participant with a similar credit standing as the firm.upon the implementation of the fva framework in 2013, the firm recorded a one-time $1.5 billion loss in principal transactions revenue that was recorded in the cib. while the fva framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the loss on implementation largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables given that the impact of the firms own credit risk, which is a significant component of funding costs, was already incorporated in the valuation of liabilities through the application of dva.the following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. the dva and fva reported below include the impact of the firms own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the firms own credit quality over time.year

and 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, consisting predominantly of loans that had fair value adjustments for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. at december 31, 2015, $696 million and $959 million of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. at december 31, 2014, $1.3 billion and $3.2 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at december 31, 2015 and 2014. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 related to assets held at the balance sheet date.of the $959 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of december 31, 2015:$556 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). these amounts are classified as level 3, as they are valued using a brokers price opinion and discounted based upon the firms experience with actual liquidation values. these discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 4% to 59%, with a weighted average of 22%.the total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, related to financial instruments held at those dates, were losses of $294 million, $992 million and $789 million, respectively; these reductions were predominantly associated with loans. for further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see note 14.additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value u.s. gaap requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value. financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included in the following table. however, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of these disclosure requirements. accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the following table include only a partial estimate of the fair value of jpmorgan chases assets and liabilities. for example, the firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. in the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to jpmorgan chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this note.financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. these instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, other borrowed funds, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. in addition, u.s. gaap requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report201notes to

the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. for certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. for example, credit losses are estimated for a financial assets remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. for a further discussion of the firms methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see valuation hierarchy on pages 185188.(c)certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.(d)carrying

notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 186 of this note. note 4  fair value optionthe fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.the firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value in order to: mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences in the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g. certain instruments elected were previously accounted for on an accrual basis) while the associated risk management arrangements are accounted for on a fair value basis; eliminate the complexities of applying certain accounting models (e.g., hedge accounting or bifurcation accounting for hybrid instruments); and/or better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. the firms election of fair value includes the following instruments: loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis. certain securities financing arrangements with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year. owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument. certain investments that receive tax credits and other equity investments acquired as part of the washington mutual transaction. structured notes issued as part of cibs client-driven activities. (structured notes are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives.) certain long-term beneficial interests issued by cibs consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report203notes to consolidated financial statementschanges in fair value under the fair value option election the

describes how the gains and losses included in earnings that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. loans and lending-related commitments: for floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. for fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. long-term debt: changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the firms credit spread. resale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowed agreements and securities lending agreements: generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements. difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding the following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of december31, 2015 and 2014, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the

respectively.(b)remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected notes. unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. however, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes.(c)where the firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the firms next call date.at december31, 2015 and 2014, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(94) million and $(147) million, respectively. for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial

are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the firms risk appetite.in the firms consumer portfolio, concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by u.s. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. in the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual customer basis. the firms wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, and collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. for additional information on loans, see note 14.the firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product (e.g., option adjustable rate mortgages (arms)), or industry segment (e.g., commercial real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high loan-to-value ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the firms assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. the table below presents both onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet consumer and wholesale-related credit exposure by the firms three credit portfolio segments as of

instruments enable end-users to modify or mitigate exposure to credit or market risks. counterparties to a derivative contract seek to obtain risks and rewards similar to those that could be obtained from purchasing or selling a related cash instrument without having to exchange upfront the full purchase or sales price. jpmorgan chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. predominantly all of the firms derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. market-making derivatives the majority of the firms derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. the firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative transactions or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. the firm also seeks to earn a spread between the client derivatives and offsetting positions, and from the remaining open risk positions. risk management derivatives the firm manages its market risk exposures using various derivative instruments. interest rate contracts are used to minimize fluctuations in earnings that are caused by changes in interest rates. fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. similarly, interest income and expense increases or decreases as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are related to such assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability in earnings. the firm generally uses interest rate swaps, forwards and futures to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings. foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated (i.e., non-u.s. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the firms net investments in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. as a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the u.s. dollarequivalent values of the foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currencydenominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. commodities contracts are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps. for a further discussion of credit derivatives, see the discussion in the credit derivatives section on pages 218220 of this note. for more information about risk management derivatives, see the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 218 of this note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 216218 of this note. derivative counterparties and settlement types the firm enters into otc derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. the firm also enters into, as principal, certain exchange-traded derivatives (etd) such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (otc-cleared) derivative contracts with central counterparties (ccps). etd contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the ccp, which is the counterparty from the inception of the transactions. otc-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the ccp for clearing. derivative clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients where the firm acts as a clearing member with respect to certain derivative exchanges and clearing houses. the firm does not reflect the clients derivative contracts in its consolidated financial statements. for further information on the firms clearing services, see note 29.208jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportaccounting for derivatives all free-standing derivatives that the firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. as permitted under u.s. gaap, the firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the firm and the derivative counterparty. for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, see note 1. the accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. the tabular disclosures on pages 212218 of this note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. for further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes, see notes 3 and 4. derivatives designated as hedges the firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes  generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. however, jpmorgan chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the firms risk management activities. for example, the firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased credit default swaps used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. for the same reason, the firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. to qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. in addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. to assess effectiveness, the firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, as well as nonstatistical methods including dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. the extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. any hedge ineffectiveness (i.e., the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk) must be reported in current-period earnings. if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. there are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. jpmorgan chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, afs securities and certain commodities inventories. for qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. if the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item  primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. jpmorgan chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currencydenominated revenue and expense. for qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in oci and recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item  primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. if the hedge relationship is terminated, then the value of the derivative recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (aoci) is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. for hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in aoci are immediately recognized in earnings. jpmorgan chase uses foreign currency hedges to protect the value of the firms net investments in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. for foreign currency qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the translation adjustments account within aoci. jpmorgan chase & co./2015

receivables and payables, the firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). these amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the firms derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally u.s. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (g7) government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral

collateral transferred related to exchange-traded derivative instruments.(c)net amount represents exposure of counterparties to the firm.liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose jpmorgan chase to credit risk  the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. it is the policy of jpmorgan chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk. the amount of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets is the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm.while derivative receivables expose the firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties favor or upon specified downgrades in the firms and its subsidiaries respective credit ratings. certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. the following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to otc and otc-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the firm has posted in the normal course of business, at december 31, 2015 and 2014.otc and otc-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade

2014, related to otc and otc-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. a downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. the liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating by the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report215notes to consolidated financial statementsliquidity impact of downgrade triggers on otc and otc-cleared

instances the firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. the firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in note 13, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under u.s. gaap. the amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at december 31,

reclassified approximately $150 million of net losses from aoci to other income because the firm determined that it was probable that the forecasted interest payment cash flows would not occur as a result of the planned reduction in wholesale non-operating deposits. the firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended december 31, 2014 or 2013.over the next 12 months, the firm expects that approximately $95 million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in aoci at december31, 2015, related to cash flow hedges, will be recognized in income. for terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately 7 years. for open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 2 years. the firms longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.net investment hedge gains and losses the

market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. all derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. see note 7 for information on principal transactions revenue. 218jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportcredit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. first, in its capacity as a market-maker, the firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. second, as an end-user, the firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the firms wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the firms market-making businesses. following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (single-name) or a broad-based index. the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. single-name cds and index cds contracts are either otc or otc-cleared derivative contracts. single-name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index cds contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. like the s&p 500 and other market indices, a cds index consists of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities. new series of cds indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. if one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. cds can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. such structures are commonly known as tranche cds. for both single-name cds contracts and index cds contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity. the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs. credit-related notes a credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. if a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.the following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the firm sold and purchased as of december31, 2015 and 2014. upon a credit event, the firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. the firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report219notes to consolidated financial statementsthe firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the firms view, the risks associated with such derivatives. total credit derivatives and credit-related

underwriting and advisory fees. underwriting fees are recognized as revenue when the firm has rendered all services to the issuer and is entitled to collect the fee from the issuer, as long as there are no other contingencies associated with the fee. underwriting fees are net of syndicate expense; the firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndication fees as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. advisory fees are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed and the fee has been earned. the following table presents the components of investment banking fees. year ended december 31,(in millions)201520142013underwritingequity$1,408$1,571$1,499debt3,2323,3403,537total underwriting4,6404,9115,036advisory2,1111,6311,318total investment banking fees$6,751$6,542$6,354principal transactions principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. in connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives. for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities, see note 6.in the financial commodity markets, the firm transacts in otc derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and exchange-traded derivatives that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. in the physical commodity markets, the firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. prior to the 2014 sale of certain parts of its physical commodity business, the firm also engaged in the purchase, sale, transport and storage of power, gas, liquefied natural gas, coal, crude oil and refined products.physical commodities inventories are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value) subject to any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, with realized gains and losses and unrealized losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. the following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. this table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the firms client-driven market-making activities.see note 8 for further information on interest income and interest expense. trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. the firms client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business. year ended december 31, (in millions)201520142013trading revenue by instrument typeinterest

management-related activities or transactions, deposit accounts and other loan-servicing activities. these fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. asset management, administration and commissions this revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services, insurance premiums and commissions, and other products. these fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. performance-based fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets, are accrued and recognized at the end of the performance period in which the target is met. the firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain services in connection

banking production and servicing revenue, including fees and income derived from mortgages originated with the intent to sell; mortgage sales and servicing including losses related to the repurchase of previously sold loans; the impact of risk-management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and msrs; and revenue related to any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations. this revenue category also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments for mortgage loans held-for-sale, as well as changes in fair value for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option. changes in the fair value of ccb msrs are reported in mortgage fees and related income. net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. for a further discussion of msrs, see note 17.card incomethis revenue category includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and net fees earned from processing credit card transactions for merchants. card income is recognized as earned. cost related to rewards programs is recorded when the rewards are earned by the customer and presented as a reduction to interchange income. annual fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. credit card revenue sharing agreementsthe firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners and affinity organizations (collectively, partners), which grant the firm exclusive rights to market to the customers or members of such partners. these partners endorse the credit card programs and provide their customer and member lists to the firm, and they may also conduct marketing activities and provide awards under the various credit card programs. the terms of these agreements generally range from three to ten years.the firm typically makes incentive payments to the partners based on new account originations, sales volumes and the cost of the partners marketing activities and awards. payments based on new account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs. payments to partners based on sales volumes are deducted from interchange income as the related revenue is earned. payments based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the firm as incurred and reported as noninterest expense.other incomeother income on the firms consolidated statements of income included the following: year ended december 31, (in

current-period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with u.s. gaap absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. details of interest income and interest expense were as

defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit (opeb) plans that provide benefits to its employees. these plans are discussed below.defined benefit pension plansthe firm has a qualified noncontributory u.s. defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to substantially all u.s. employees. the u.s. plan employs a cash balance formula in the form of pay and interest credits to determine the benefits to be provided at retirement, based on years of service and eligible compensation (generally base salary/regular pay and variable incentive compensation capped at $100,000 annually). employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of service, and benefits generally vest after three years of service. the firm also offers benefits through defined benefit pension plans to qualifying employees in certain non-u.s. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service.it is the firms policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. the firm does not anticipate at this time any contribution to the u.s. defined benefit pension plan in 2016. the 2016 contributions to the non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $47 million of which $31 million are contractually required.jpmorgan chase also has a number of defined benefit pension plans that are not subject to title iv of the employee retirement income security act. the most significant of these plans is the excess retirement plan, pursuant to which certain employees previously earned pay credits on compensation amounts above the maximum stipulated by law under a qualified plan; no further pay credits are allocated under this plan. the excess retirement plan had an unfunded projected benefit obligation (pbo) in the amount of $237 million and $257 million, at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.defined contribution plansjpmorgan chase currently provides two qualified defined contribution plans in the u.s. and other similar arrangements in certain non-u.s. locations, all of which are administered in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. the most significant of these plans is the jpmorgan chase 401(k) savings plan (the 401(k) savings plan), which covers substantially all u.s. employees. employees can contribute to the 401(k) savings plan on a pretax and/or roth 401(k) after-tax basis. the jpmorgan chase common stock fund, which is an investment option under the 401(k) savings plan, is a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan.the firm matches eligible employee contributions up to 5% of eligible compensation (generally base salary/regular pay and variable incentive compensation) on an annual basis. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report223notes to consolidated financial statementsemployees begin to receive matching contributions after completing a one-year-of-service requirement. employees with total annual cash compensation of $250,000 or more are not eligible for matching contributions. matching contributions vest after three years of service. the 401(k) savings plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing contributions by participating companies for certain employees, subject to a specified vesting schedule.opeb plansjpmorgan chase offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and postretirement medical benefits to qualifying u.s. employees. these benefits vary with the length of service and the date of hire and provide for limits on the firms share of covered medical benefits. the medical and life insurance benefits are both contributory. effective january 1, 2015, there was a transition of certain medicare eligible retirees from jpmc group sponsored coverage to medicare exchanges. as a result of this change, eligible retirees will receive a healthcare reimbursement account amount each year if they enroll through the medicare exchange. the impact of this change was not material. postretirement medical benefits also are offered to qualifying united kingdom (u.k.) employees.jpmorgan chases u.s. opeb obligation is funded with corporate-owned life insurance (coli) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. while the firm owns the coli policies, coli proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. the u.k. opeb plan is unfunded.the following table presents the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets for the firms u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans.defined

defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the pbo or the fair value of the plan assets. any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the u.s. defined benefit pension plan is currently seven years and for the non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. in addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized. the average remaining amortization period for the u.s. defined benefit pension plan for current prior service costs is four years.for the firms opeb plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. this value is referred to as the market related value of assets. amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted for gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market related value of assets. any excess net gain or loss is amortized over the average expected lifetime of retired participants, which is currently thirteen years; however, prior service costs resulting from plan changes are amortized over the average years of service remaining to full eligibility age, which is currently two years.the following table presents pretax pension and opeb amounts recorded in aoci.defined benefit pension plansdecember 31,u.s.non-u.s.opeb plans(in millions)201520142015201420152014net

assets is a blended average of the investment advisors projected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the various asset classes, weighted by the asset allocation. returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. other asset-class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short-term portfolio mix of each plan.for the u.k. defined benefit pension plans, which represent the most significant of the non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans, procedures similar to those in the u.s. are used to develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return on u.k. plan assets is an average of projected long-term returns for each asset class. the return on equities has been selected by reference to the yield on long-term u.k. government bonds plus an equity risk premium above the risk-free rate. the expected return on aa rated long-term corporate bonds is based on an implied yield for similar bonds.the discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans was provided by our actuaries. this rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plans projected cash flows; such portfolios are derived from a broad-based universe of high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. in years in which these hypothetical bond portfolios generate excess cash, such excess is assumed to be reinvested at the one-year forward rates implied by the citigroup pension discount curve published as of the measurement date. the discount rate for the u.k. defined benefit pension plan represents a rate of appropriate duration from the analysis of yield curves provided by our actuaries.in 2014, the society of actuaries (soa) completed a comprehensive review of mortality experience of uninsured private retirement plans in the u.s. in october 2014, the soa published new mortality tables and a new mortality improvement scale that reflects improved life expectancies and an expectation that this trend will continue. in 2014, the firm adopted the soas tables and projection scale, resulting in an estimated increase in pbo of $533 million. in 2015, the soa updated the projection scale to reflect two additional years of historical data. the firm has adopted the updated projection scale resulting in an estimated decrease in pbo in 2015 of $112 million.at december31, 2015, the firm increased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans in light of current market interest rates, which will result in a decrease in expense of approximately $63 million for 2016. the 2016 expected long-term rate of return on u.s. defined benefit pension plan assets and u.s. opeb plan assets are 6.50% and 5.75%, respectively. for 2016, the initial health care benefit obligation trend assumption has been set at 5.50%, and the ultimate health care trend assumption and the year to reach the ultimate rate remains at 5.00% and 2017, respectively, unchanged from 2015. as of december31, 2015, the interest crediting rate assumption and the assumed rate of compensation increase remained at 5.00% and 3.50%, respectively.the following tables present the weighted-average annualized actuarial assumptions for the projected and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations, and the components of net periodic benefit costs, for the firms significant u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans, as of and for the periods

assets and the discount rate. with all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets would result in an aggregate increase of approximately $39 million in 2016 u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plan expense. a 25-basis point decline in the discount rate for the u.s. plans would result in an increase in 2016 u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plan expense of approximately an aggregate $31 million and an increase in the related benefit obligations of approximately an aggregate $296 million. a 25-basis point decrease in the interest crediting rate for the u.s. defined benefit pension plan would result in a decrease in 2016 u.s. defined benefit pension expense of approximately $35 million and a decrease in the related pbo of approximately $145 million. a 25-basis point decline in the discount rates for the non-u.s. plans would result in an increase in the 2016 non-u.s. defined benefit pension plan expense of approximately $17 million.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report227notes to consolidated financial statementsinvestment strategy and asset allocationthe firms u.s. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in trust and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments (e.g., hedge funds, private equity, real estate and real assets). non-u.s. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in various trusts and are also invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities. assets of the firms coli policies, which are used to partially fund the u.s. opeb plan, are held in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices.the investment policy for the firms u.s. defined benefit pension plan assets is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of the plan using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. periodically the firm performs a comprehensive analysis on the u.s. defined benefit pension plan asset allocations, incorporating projected asset and liability data, which focuses on the short- and long-term impact of the asset allocation on cumulative pension expense, economic cost, present value of contributions and funded status. as the u.s. defined benefit pension plan is overfunded, the investment strategy for this plan was adjusted in 2013 to provide for greater liquidity. currently, approved asset allocation ranges are: u.s. equity 0% to 45%, international equity 0% to 40%, debt securities 0% to 80%, hedge funds 0% to 5%, real estate 0% to 10%, real assets 0% to 10% and private equity 0% to 20%. asset allocations are not managed to a specific target but seek to shift asset class allocations within these stated ranges. investment strategies incorporate the economic outlook and the anticipated implications of the macroeconomic environment on the various asset classes while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity for the plan. the firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolio, which is rebalanced when deemed necessary.for the u.k. defined benefit pension plans, which represent the most significant of the non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans, the assets are invested to maximize returns subject to an appropriate level of risk relative to the plans liabilities. in order to reduce the volatility in returns relative to the plans liability profiles, the u.k. defined benefit pension plans largest asset allocations are to debt securities of appropriate durations. other assets, mainly equity securities, are then invested for capital appreciation, to provide long-term investment growth. similar to the u.s. defined benefit pension plan, asset allocations and asset managers for the u.k. plans are reviewed regularly and the portfolios are rebalanced when deemed necessary.investments held by the plans include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both u.s. and non-u.s. investment instruments. additionally, the investments in each of the common/collective trust funds and registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. as of december31, 2015, assets held by the firms u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension and opeb plans do not include jpmorgan chase common stock, except through indirect exposures through investments in third-party stock-index funds. the plans hold investments in funds that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of jpmorgan chase in the amount of $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion for u.s. plans and $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for non-u.s. plans, as of december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the following table presents the

reportnote 10  employee stock-based incentivesemployee stock-based awardsin 2015, 2014 and 2013, jpmorgan chase granted long-term stock-based awards to certain employees under its long-term incentive plan, as amended and restated effective may19, 2015 (ltip). under the terms of the ltip, as of december31, 2015, 93 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through may2019. the ltip is the only active plan under which the firm is currently granting stock-based incentive awards. in the following discussion, the ltip, plus prior firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the lti plans, and such plans constitute the firms stock-based incentive plans.restricted stock units (rsus) are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. generally, rsus are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. in addition, rsus typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination, subject to post-employment and other restrictions based on age or service-related requirements. all rsus awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. rsus entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the rsus are outstanding and, as such, are considered participating securities as discussed in note 24.under the lti plans, stock options and stock appreciation rights (sars) have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of jpmorgan chases common stock on the grant date. the firm periodically grants employee stock options to individual employees. there were no material grants of stock options or sarsin 2015 and 2014. grants of sars in 2013 become exercisable ratably over five years (i.e., 20% per year) and contain clawback provisions similar to rsus. the 2013 grants of sars contain full-career eligibility provisions. sars generally expire ten years after the grant date. the firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. for awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. for each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employees full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.the firms policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee stock-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the firm settled all of its employee stock-based awards by issuing treasury shares.in january2008, the firm awarded to its chairman and chief executive officer up to 2 million sars. the terms of this award are distinct from, and more restrictive than, other equity grants regularly awarded by the firm. on july 15, 2014, the compensation & management development committee and board of directors determined that all requirements for the vesting of the 2 million sar awards had been met and thus, the awards became exercisable. the sars, which will expire in january 2018, have an exercise price of $39.83 (the price of jpmorgan chase common stock on the date of grant). the expense related to this award was dependent on changes in fair value of the sars through july 15, 2014 (the date when the vested number of sars were determined), and the cumulative expense was recognized ratably over the service period, which was initially assumed to be five years but, effective in the first quarter of 2013, had been extended to six and one-half years. the firm recognized $3million and $14million in compensation expense in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for this award.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report231notes to consolidated financial statementsrsus, employee stock options and sars activitycompensation expense for rsus is measured based on the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee stock options and sars, is measured at the grant date using the black-scholes valuation model. compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. the following table summarizes jpmorgan chases rsus, employee stock options and sars activity for 2015.rsusoptions/sarsyear ended

classified as trading assets are discussed in note 3. predominantly all of the firms afs and htm investment securities (the investment securities portfolio) are held by treasury and cio in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. at december 31, 2015, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of aa+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by s&p and moodys). afs securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). the specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on afs securities, which are included in securities gains/(losses) on the consolidated statements of income. htm debt securities, which management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. for both afs and htm debt securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the security. during 2014, the firm transferred u.s. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of u.s. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from afs to htm. these securities were transferred at fair value, and the transfer was a non-cash transaction. aoci included net pretax unrealized losses of $9 million on the securities at the date of transfer. the transfer reflected the firms intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact

statementsgross unrealized losses the firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. as of december 31, 2015, the firm does not intend to sell any securities with a loss position in aoci, and it is not likely that the firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in aoci are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of december 31, 2015. other-than-temporary impairment afs debt and equity securities and htm debt securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of the firms ongoing assessment of other-than-temporary impairment (otti). for most types of debt securities, the firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary when the firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. for beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below aa at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the firm considers an impairment to be other than temporary when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. for afs equity securities, the firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary if it is probable that the firm will not recover its cost basis. potential otti is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and the firms intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. for afs debt securities, the firm recognizes otti losses in earnings if the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. in these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities. for debt securities in an unrealized loss position that the firm has the intent and ability to hold, the expected cash flows to be received from the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. in the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in oci. the firms cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period. for securities issued in a securitization, the firm estimates cash flows considering underlying loan-level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (pool losses) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. the firm also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios. for equity securities, otti losses are recognized in earnings if the firm intends to sell the security. in other cases the firm considers the relevant factors noted above, as well as the firms intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and whether evidence exists to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the cost basis. any impairment loss on an equity security is equal to the full difference between the cost basis and the fair value of the security. securities gains and

securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)includes securities with no stated maturity. substantially all of the firms residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. the estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately five years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, two years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and four years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report237notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 13  securities financing activitiesjpmorgan chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions (collectively, securities financing agreements) primarily to finance the firms inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions, accommodate customers financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the firms consolidated balance sheets. resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, see note 1. fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded in interest income and interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. the firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. for further information regarding the fair value option, see note 4. the securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the consolidated balance sheets. generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. however, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. secured financing transactions expose the firm to credit and liquidity risk. to manage these risks, the firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency mbs) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. in resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions, the firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. in repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities exceeds the value of the initial cash principal advanced, and any collateral amounts exchanged. additionally, the firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. it is also the firms policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see note 30. as a result of the firms credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above, the firm did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. certain prior period amounts for securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, as well as securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned, have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. these revisions had no impact on the firms consolidated balance sheets or its results of operations. 238jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe following table

loansloan accounting frameworkthe accounting for a loan depends on managements strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., retained), other than purchased credit-impaired (pci) loansloans held-for-saleloans at fair valuepci loans held-for-investmentthe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories:loans held-for-investment (other than pci loans)originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than pci loans, are measured at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: allowance for loan losses; charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.interest incomeinterest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than pci loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return. nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by u.s. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is in doubt, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. a loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. on the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. in addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). for consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. a loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. as permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. however, the firm separately establishes an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income on credit card loans. the allowance is established with a charge to interest income and is reported as an offset to loans. allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the firms consolidated statements of income. see note 15 for further information on the firms accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. charge-offs consumer loans, other than risk-rated business banking, risk-rated auto and pci loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the federal financial institutions examination council (ffiec). residential real estate loans, non-modified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off at 180 days past due. auto and student loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due, and modified credit card loans are charged off at 120 days past due. certain consumer loans will be charged off earlier than the ffiec charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: a charge-off is recognized when a loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring (tdr) if the loan is determined to be collateral-dependent. a loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrowers operations, income or other resources. loans to borrowers who have experienced an event (e.g., bankruptcy) that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards. residential real estate and auto loans are charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due, or sooner if the loan is determined to be collateral-242jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportdependent. credit card and scored business banking loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of the bankruptcy filing or other event. student loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due after receiving notification of a bankruptcy. auto loans are written down to net realizable value upon repossession of the automobile and after a redemption period (i.e., the period during which a borrower may cure the loan) has passed. other than in certain limited circumstances, the firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on government-guaranteed loans. wholesale loans, risk-rated business banking loans and risk-rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impaired and collateral-dependent. the determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the firms claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrowers equity or the loan collateral. when a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). in cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. for illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. when it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the firm obtains a brokers price opinion of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (exterior opinions), which is then updated at least every six months thereafter. as soon as practicable after the firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), generally, either through foreclosure or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower, the firm obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (interior appraisals). exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the firms experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- and product-specific factors. for commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the firms policies. the firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. loans held-for-sale held-for-sale loans are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. for consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. for wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. the deferred fees and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. held-for-sale loans are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. because held-for-sale loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the firms allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. loans at fair value loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. for these loans, the earned current contractual interest payment is recognized in interest income. changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. because these loans are recognized at fair value, the firms allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. see note 4 for further information on the firms elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. see note 3 and note 4 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. pci loans pci loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. pci loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loans origination date and therefore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. because pci loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to pci loans is recorded at the acquisition date. see page 255 of this note for information on accounting for pci loans subsequent to their acquisition. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report243notes to consolidated financial statementsloan classification changes loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. in the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firms allowance methodology. for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firms allowance for loan losses, see note 15.loan modifications the firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. through the modification, jpmorgan chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the firms economic loss, avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the firm from the borrower. the concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. such modifications are accounted for and reported as tdrs. a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms. in certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or above the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. in such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and the firm expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impaired and as a tdr only during the year of the modification; in subsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as an impaired loan or as a tdr so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured.loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a tdr are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. these loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (a) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (b) the firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrowers debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, loan-to-value (ltv) ratios, and other current market considerations. in certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. because loans modified in tdrs are considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using the firms established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. a loan modified in a tdr generally remains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status and/or the loan has been removed from the impaired loans disclosures (i.e., loans restructured at market rates). for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the firms asset-specific allowance, see note 15.foreclosed property the firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). the firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). for loans collateralized by real property, the firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less costs to sell. each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.244jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportloan portfolio the firms loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: consumer, excluding credit card; credit card; and

borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. as the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear that the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. in the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. in addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: for residential real estate loans, including both non-pci and pci portfolios, the current estimated ltv ratio, or the combined ltv ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. additionally, ltv or combined ltv can provide insight into a borrowers continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-ltv loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. the geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. the borrowers current or refreshed fico score is a secondary credit-quality indicator for certain loans, as fico scores are an indication of the borrowers credit payment history. thus, a loan to a borrower with a low fico score (660 or below) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a high fico score. further, a loan to a borrower with a high ltv ratio and a low fico score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high ltv ratio and a high fico score.for scored auto, scored business banking and student loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.risk-rated business banking and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primary credit quality indicators are the risk rating that is assigned to the loan and whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by credit risk management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers ability to fulfill their obligations. for further information about risk-rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators, see pages 259260 of this note. residential real estate  excluding pci loans the following table provides information by class for residential real estate  excluding retained pci loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment. the following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the firms residential real estate  excluding pci loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the firms consolidated balance sheets.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report247notes to consolidated financial

which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. the dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. for residential real estate loans modified in tdrs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. in the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.at december31, 2015, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding pci loans, permanently modified in tdrs were 10 years for senior lien home equity, 9 years for junior lien home equity, 10 years for prime mortgages, including option arms, and 8 years for subprime mortgage. the estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).active and suspended foreclosure at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had

credit-impaired loanspci loans are initially recorded at fair value at acquisition. pci loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. with respect to the washington mutual transaction, all of the consumer pci loans were aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.on a quarterly basis, the firm estimates the total cash flows (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. these estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows, discounted at the pools effective interest rate. impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. the impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.the firm continues to modify certain pci loans. the impact of these modifications is incorporated into the firms quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as pci loans. in evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows, the firm incorporates the effect of any foregone interest and also considers the potential for redefault. the firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. in developing these probabilities of default, the firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment based upon industry-wide data. the firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified pci loans.the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. this amount is not reported on the firms consolidated balance sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans.if the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on pci loans were determined not to be reasonably estimable, no interest would be accreted and the loans would be reported as nonaccrual loans; however, since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for the firms pci consumer loans are reasonably estimable, interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans.the liquidation of pci loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payment in full from the borrower, or foreclosure, results in removal of the loans from the underlying pci pool. when the amount of the liquidation proceeds (e.g., cash, real estate), if any, is less than the unpaid principal balance of the loan, the difference is first applied against the pci pools nonaccretable difference for principal losses (i.e., the lifetime credit loss estimate established as a purchase accounting adjustment at the acquisition date). when the nonaccretable difference for a particular loan pool has been fully depleted, any excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loan over the liquidation proceeds is written off against the pci pools allowance for loan losses. beginning in 2014, write-offs of pci loans also include other adjustments, primarily related to interest forgiveness modifications. because the firms pci loans are accounted for at a pool level, the firm does not recognize charge-offs of pci loans when they reach specified stages of delinquency (i.e., unlike non-pci consumer loans, these loans are not charged off based on ffiec standards).the pci portfolio affects the firms results of operations primarily through: (i)contribution to net interest margin; (ii)expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii)any provision for loan losses. the pci loans acquired in the washington mutual transaction were funded based on the interest rate characteristics of the loans. for example, variable-rate loans were funded with variable-rate liabilities and fixed-rate loans were funded with fixed-rate liabilities with a similar maturity profile. a net spread will be earned on the declining balance of the portfolio, which is estimated as of december31, 2015, to have a remaining weighted-average life of 9 years.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual

offset by changes in prepayment assumptions.(b)reclassifications from the nonaccretable difference in the year ended december31, 2015 were driven by continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, as well as increased granularity in the impairment estimates.the factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option arm and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.active and suspended foreclosure at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had pci residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in reo, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report257notes to consolidated financial statementscredit card loan portfoliothe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the firm. delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. in addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.while the borrowers credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrowers credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. however, the distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio. refreshed fico score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the table below; fico is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.the firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. however, certain cardholders fico scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.the table below sets forth information about the firms credit card loans.as of or for the year ended december 31,(in millions, except ratios)20152014net

loans82123198loan modifications jpmorgan chase may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. the firm may also offer short-term programs for borrowers who may be in need of temporary relief; however, none are currently being offered. modifications under all short- and long-term programs typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. substantially all modifications are considered to be tdrs.if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. assuming that the cardholder does not begin to perform in accordance with those payment terms, the loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the firms standard charge-off policy. in addition, if a borrower successfully completes a short-term modification program, then the loan reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. however, in most cases, the firm does not reinstate the borrowers line of credit.new enrollments in these loan modification programs for the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were $638 million, $807 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.financial effects of modifications and redefaults the following table

have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. a substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the firms standard charge-off policy. based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for credit card loans modified was expected to be 25.61%, 27.91% and 30.72% as of december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.wholesale loan portfoliowholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.the primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned each loan. risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. risk ratings on loans consider the probability of default (pd) and the loss given default (lgd). the pd is the likelihood that a loan will default and not be fully repaid by the borrower. the lgd is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.management considers several factors to determine an appropriate risk rating, including the obligors debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligors earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. the firms definition of criticized aligns with the banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. risk ratings generally represent ratings profiles similar to those defined by s&p and moodys. investment-grade ratings range from aaa/aaa to bbb-/baa3. noninvestment-grade ratings jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report259notes to consolidated financial statementsare classified as noncriticized (bb+/ba1 and b-/b3) and criticized (ccc+/caa1 and below), and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing managements assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. criticized loans have a higher probability of default than noncriticized loans.risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by credit risk management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligors ability to fulfill its obligations.as noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. as part of the overall credit risk management framework, the firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. see note 5 for further detail on industry concentrations.the table below provides information by class of receivable for the

the consumer, including credit card, portfolio segments (primarily scored); and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio, and represents managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the firms loan portfolio. the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, a formula-based component and a component related to pci loans, as described below. management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and consumer lending-related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans. during 2015, the firm did not make any significant changes to the methodologies or policies used to determine its allowance for credit losses; such policies are described in the following paragraphs. the asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in tdrs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. to determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger loans are evaluated individually, while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. scored loans (i.e., consumer loans) are pooled by product type, while risk-rated loans (primarily wholesale loans) are segmented by risk rating. the firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate. subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. in certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loans fair value. impaired collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell and therefore may not be subject to an asset-specific reserve as are other impaired loans. see note 14 for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans. the asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in tdrs incorporates the effects of foregone interest, if any, in the present value calculation and also incorporates the effect of the modification on the loans expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. for residential real estate loans modified in tdrs, the firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. in developing these probabilities of default, the firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. the firm also considers its own historical loss experience to date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. for credit card loans modified in tdrs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the firms historical experience by type of modification program. for wholesale loans modified in tdrs, expected losses incorporate redefaults based on managements expectation of the borrowers ability to repay under the modified terms. the formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for incurred credit losses in performing risk-rated loans and all consumer loans, except for any loans restructured in tdrs and pci loans. see note 14 for more information on pci loans. for scored loans, the statistical calculation is performed on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics (e.g., product type) and generally computed by applying loss factors to outstanding principal balances over an estimated loss emergence period. the loss emergence period represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss (through a charge-off). estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. 262jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportloss factors are statistically derived and sensitive to changes in delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values and other risk factors. the firm uses a number of different forecasting models to estimate both the pd and the loss severity, including delinquency roll rate models and credit loss severity models. in developing pd and loss severity assumptions, the firm also considers known and anticipated changes in the economic environment, including changes in home prices, unemployment rates and other risk indicators. a nationally recognized home price index measure is used to estimate both the pd and the loss severity on residential real estate loans at the metropolitan statistical areas (msa) level. loss severity estimates are regularly validated by comparison to actual losses recognized on defaulted loans, market-specific real estate appraisals and property sales activity. the economic impact of potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation because of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications. for risk-rated loans, the statistical calculation is the product of an estimated pd and an estimated lgd. these factors are determined based on the credit quality and specific attributes of the firms loans and lending-related commitments to each obligor. in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the obligors debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligors earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. these factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned by the firm. pd estimates are based on observable external through-the-cycle data, using credit-rating agency default statistics. lgd estimates are based on the firms history of actual credit losses over more than one credit cycle. estimates of pd and lgd are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external and firm-specific historical data. management applies judgment within an established framework to adjust the results of applying the statistical calculation described above. the determination of the appropriate adjustment is based on managements view of loss events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the loss factors and that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. for the scored loan portfolios, adjustments to the statistical calculation are made in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. factors related to unemployment, home prices, borrower behavior and lien position, the estimated effects of the mortgage foreclosure-related settlement with federal and state officials and uncertainties regarding the ultimate success of loan modifications are incorporated into the calculation, as appropriate. for junior lien products, management considers the delinquency and/or modification status of any senior liens in determining the adjustment. in addition, for the risk-rated portfolios, any adjustments made to the statistical calculation take into consideration model imprecision, deteriorating conditions within an industry, product or portfolio type, geographic location, credit concentration, and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation. management establishes an asset-specific allowance for lending-related commitments that are considered impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments. these are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown. determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. at least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the chief risk officer, the chief financial officer and the controller of the firm and discussed with the risk policy and audit committees of the board of directors of the firm. as of december31, 2015, jpmorgan chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio). jpmorgan chase &

in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor needs269271municipal bond vehicles269270the firms other business segments are also involved with vies, but to a lesser extent, as follows:asset management: am sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed vies. as asset manager of the funds, am earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each funds investment objective and is competitively priced. for fund entities that qualify as vies, ams interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.commercial banking: cb makes investments in and provides lending to community development entities that may meet the definition of a vie. in addition, cb provides financing and lending-related services to certain client-sponsored vies. in general, cb does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities.corporate: the private equity business, within corporate, is involved with entities that may meet the definition of vies. however, the firms private equity business is generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including vies.the firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to vies sponsored by third parties, as described on page 271 of this note.significant firm-sponsored variable interest entitiescredit card securitizationsthe card business securitizes both originated and purchased credit card loans, primarily through the chase issuance trust (the trust). the firms continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided sellers interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.the firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on the firms ability to direct the activities of these vies through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. additionally, the nature and extent of the firms other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the firm to absorb losses and gives the firm the right to receive certain benefits from these vies that could potentially be significant.the underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the firms other obligations or the claims of the firms other creditors.the agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (which is generally 4%). as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm held undivided interests in firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $13.6 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. the firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 22% for both the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm also retained $0 million and $40 million of senior securities, and as of both december31, 2015 and 2014, retained $5.3 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts. the firms undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.266jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportfirm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization truststhe firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including student loans) primarily in its ccb and cib businesses. depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.the following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the firm. continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. in certain instances, the firms only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. see securitization activity

government agencies.(b)consists of securities backed by commercial loans (predominantly real estate) and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables purchased from third parties. the firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.(c)the table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see note 17 for a discussion of msrs); securities retained from loan sales to u.s. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities (see note 6 for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $163 million and $73 million, respectively, at december31, 2015, and $136 million and $34 million, respectively, at december31, 2014, which the firm purchased in connection with cibs secondary market-making activities.(d)includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.(e)as of december31, 2015 and 2014, 76% and 77%, respectively, of the firms retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated a or better, on an s&p-equivalent basis. the retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion of investment-grade and $93 million and $185 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $3.7 billion and $3.7 billion of investment-grade and $198 million and $194 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report267notes to consolidated financial statementsresidential mortgagethe firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by ccb, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either ccb or cib. ccb generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans originated or purchased by ccb, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by cib. for securitizations holding loans serviced by ccb, the firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the vie because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. ccb may also retain an interest upon securitization.in addition, cib engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by firm-sponsored securitization trusts. as a result, cib at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. in certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by cib or held by ccb, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by ccb, the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. see the table on page 271 of this note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations.the firm does not consolidate a residential mortgage securitization (firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the firm did not consolidate the assets of certain firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization vies, in which the firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. see the table on page 271 of this note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationscib originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. cib may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. for commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the vie generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (controlling class). see the table on page 271 of this note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.the firm retains servicing responsibilities for certain student loan securitizations. the firm has the power to direct the activities of these vies through these servicing responsibilities. see the table on page 271 of this note for more information on the consolidated student loan securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.re-securitizationsthe firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests. these transfers occur in connection with both agency (federal national mortgage association (fannie mae), federal home loan mortgage company (freddie mac) and ginnie mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored vies, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. the firms consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the firms role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. during the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the firm transferred $21.9 billion, $22.7 billion and $25.3 billion, respectively, of securities to agency vies, and $777 million, $1.1 billion and $55 million, respectively, of securities to private-label vies.most re-securitizations with which the firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. for these transactions, the firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the firm does not consolidate the re-securitization vie.in more limited circumstances, the firm creates a re-securitization trust independently and not in conjunction with specific clients. in these circumstances, the firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust because of the decisions made during the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the firm consolidates the re-securitization vie if the firm holds an interest that could potentially be significant.additionally, the firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. in these circumstances, the firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the firm is involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the firm does not consolidate the re-securitization vie.268jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportas of december31, 2015 and 2014, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the firm has continuing involvement were $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm held $4.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities. the firms exposure to non-consolidated private-label re-securitization entities as of december31, 2015 and 2014 was not material. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm consolidated an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities of firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations.multi-seller conduitsmulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the firm. the conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. the primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. in most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. the deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the firms potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.to ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. the amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance.the firm consolidates its firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. as administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. the firms interests that could potentially be significant to the vies include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. see page 271 of this note for further information on consolidated vie assets and liabilities.in the normal course of business, jpmorgan chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the firm-administered multi-seller conduits. the firm held $15.7 billion and $5.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the firm-administered multi-seller conduits at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the firms investments reflect the firms funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. the firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the firm-administered multi-seller conduits.deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the firm have been eliminated in consolidation. the firm or the firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the firm-administered multi-seller conduits. the unfunded portion of these commitments was $5.6 billion and $9.9 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see note 29.vies associated with investor intermediation activities as a financial intermediary, the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions with these vies, typically using derivatives, to meet investor needs. the firm may also provide liquidity and other support. the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit, market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed. the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in on behalf of clients are municipal bond vehicles.municipal bond vehiclesmunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (tob) trusts allow investors to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. in a typical tob transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (floaters) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (residuals). the floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the tob trust. the residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. tob transactions where the residual is held by a third party investor are typically known as customer tob trusts, and non-customer tob trusts are transactions where the residual is retained by the firm. the firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer tob transactions and certain customer tob transactions established prior to 2014. the firm may provide various services to a tob trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report269notes to consolidated financial statementsj.p. morgan securities llc may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for tob trusts. the remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. the remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to make markets in floaters. at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm held an insignificant amount of these floaters on its consolidated balance sheets and did not hold any significant amounts during 2015.jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. or j.p. morgan securities llc often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the tob trusts. the liquidity providers obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (termination events), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. in addition, the liquidity providers exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the residual holders.holders of the floaters may put, or tender, their floaters to the tob trust. if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the tob trust for the purchase of or directly purchases the tendered floaters. in certain customer tob transactions, the firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the residual holder. in those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, if the proceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not sufficient to repay amounts owed to the firm, as liquidity or tender option provider, the firm has recourse to the third party residual holders for any shortfall. residual holders with reimbursement agreements are required to post collateral with the firm to support such reimbursement obligations should the market value of the underlying municipal bonds decline. the firm does not have any intent to protect residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds.tob trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. the firm consolidates non-customer tob trusts because as the residual holder, the firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and have the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. the firm does not consolidate customer tob trusts, since the firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. certain non-consolidated customer tob trusts are sponsored by a third party, and not the firm. see page 271 of this note for further information on consolidated municipal bond vehicles.the firms exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond vies at december31, 2015 and 2014, including the ratings profile of the vies assets, was as follows.december 31, (in billions)fair value of assets held by viesliquidity facilitiesexcess(a)maximum

for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. these transactions are conducted at arms-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific vie, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. where the firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the firm records and reports these positions on its consolidated balance sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.consolidated vie assets and liabilitiesthe following table

between one and five years, and $3.9 billion over five years, all respectively.(f)includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report271notes to consolidated financial statementsloan securitizationsthe firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. the purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the firm.for loan securitizations in which the firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the firms creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).for loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.securitization activitythe following table provides information related to the firms securitization activities for the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,

government-sponsored enterprises (u.s. gses), loans in securitization transactions pursuant to ginnie mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesin addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess msrs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to u.s. gses. these loans and excess msrs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the u.s. gses, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). the firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to ginnie mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another u.s. government agency. the firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. for a limited number of loan sales, the firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 272jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportwith the purchaser. see note 29 for additional information about the firms loan sales- and securitization-related

also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for ginnie mae loan pools, as well as for other u.s. government agencies under certain arrangements. the firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from ginnie mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. when the firms repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had recorded on its consolidated balance sheets $11.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the firm had an option to repurchase. predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from ginnie mae loan pools. additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $343 million and $464 million as of december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by u.s. government agencies.

the fair value of the net assets acquired. subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment.the goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the firms businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the firms operating committee. the following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.december 31, (in millions)201520142013consumer & community banking$30,769$30,941$30,985corporate & investment bank6,7726,7806,888commercial banking2,8612,8612,862asset

$276 million.(b)includes $101 million of private equity goodwill, which was disposed of as part of the private equity sale completed in january 2015.impairment testingthe firms goodwill was not impaired at december31, 2015. further, except for the goodwill related to its private equity business, the firms goodwill was not impaired at december31, 2014. $276 million of goodwill was written off during 2014 related to the goodwill impairment associated with the firms private equity business. no goodwill was written off due to impairment during 2013.the goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. in the first step, the current fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value (including goodwill), then the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired. if the fair value is less than the carrying value (including goodwill), then a second step is performed. in the second step, the implied current fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. the resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. if the carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied current fair value, then no goodwill impairment is recognized. the firm uses the reporting units allocated equity plus goodwill capital as a proxy for the carrying amounts of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of equity to the firms lines of business, which takes into consideration the capital the business segment would require if it were operating independently, incorporating sufficient capital to address regulatory capital requirements (including basel iii), economic risk measures and capital levels for similarly rated peers. proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the firms annual budget process, which is reviewed by the firms board of directors. allocated equity is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed.the primary method the firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. the models project cash flows for the forecast period and use the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units earnings forecasts, which include the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes (including, but not limited to the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act)), and which are reviewed with the senior management of the firm. the discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the firms overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the capital asset pricing model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or managements forecasts and assumptions). to assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. in addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the firms overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness.the valuations derived from the discounted cash flow models are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to 274jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportassess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the firms businesses and competitor institutions. management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair value of the firms reporting units and jpmorgan chases market capitalization. in evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (a) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (b) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (c) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the firms reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.mortgage servicing rightsmortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. the fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the msr asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. msrs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.as permitted by u.s. gaap, the firm has elected to account for its msrs at fair value. the firm treats its msrs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its msr asset and its treatment of msrs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. the firm estimates the fair value of msrs using an option-adjusted spread (oas) model, which projects msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the firms prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. the model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report275notes to consolidated financial statementsthe fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. msrs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that consist of the msr asset. conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e., those for which the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. jpmorgan chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage changes in the fair value of msrs. the intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.the following table summarizes msr activity for the years ended december31, 2015,

senior to all cash payments to investors. in addition, the firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. however, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.(e)for the year ending december 31, 2014, the negative impact was primarily related to higher capital allocated to the mortgage servicing business, which, in turn, resulted in an increase in the oas. the resulting oas assumption was consistent with capital and return requirements the firm believed a market participant would consider, taking into account factors such as the operating risk environment and regulatory and economic capital requirements.276jpmorgan chase & co./2015

value of the firms msrs at december31, 2015 and 2014, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.december 31,(in millions,

generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report277notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 18  premises and equipmentpremises

the option of jpmorgan chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.(g)the aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2015 is $50.6 billion in 2016, $49.5 billion in 2017, $39.2 billion in 2018, $30.4 billion in 2019 and $30.7 billion in 2020.the weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 2.34% and 2.42% as of december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, jpmorgan chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. the use of these instruments modifies the firms interest expense on the associated debt. the modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 1.64% and 1.50% as of december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. jpmorgan chase & co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes. these guarantees rank on parity with the firms other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the amount of such guaranteed long-term debt was $152 million and $352 million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the firms unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the firms credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities at december31, 2015, the firm had outstanding eight wholly owned delaware statutory business trusts (issuer trusts) that had issued trust preferred securities.the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the firm to the issuer trusts, totaling $4.0 billion and $5.4 billion

york stock exchange, and they are exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time until october28, 2018. the original warrant exercise price was $42.42 per share. the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant exercise price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the extent to which regular quarterly cash dividends exceed $0.38 per share. as a result of the firms quarterly common stock dividend exceeding $0.38 per share commencing with the second quarter of 2014, the exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted each subsequent quarter, and was $42.284 as of december31, 2015. there has been no change in the number of shares issuable upon exercise.on march11, 2015, in conjunction with the federal reserves release of its 2015 comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) results, the firms board of directors has authorized a $6.4 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. as of december31, 2015, $2.7 billion (on a settlement-date basis) of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. this authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the firms equity-based compensation plans.the following table sets forth the firms repurchases of common equity for the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, on a settlement-date basis. there were no warrants repurchased during the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.year ended december 31, (in millions)201520142013total number

during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity  for example, during internal trading blackout periods. all purchases under a rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a

shareearnings per share (eps) is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. jpmorgan chase grants restricted stock and rsus to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock; these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. options issued under employee benefit plans that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted eps.the following table presents the calculation of basic and

consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. jpmorgan chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. jpmorgan chases expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the firm expects to realize.due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the firms businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. agreement of tax liabilities between jpmorgan chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. thus, the firms final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.effective tax rate and expensea reconciliation of the applicable statutory u.s. income tax rate to the effective tax rate for each of the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, is presented in the following table.effective tax rateyear ended december

recorded each period directly in stockholders equity and certain tax benefits associated with the firms employee stock-based compensation plans. the tax effect of all items recorded directly to

formation of specific strategies and steps taken to fulfill jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report285these requirements and needs, the firm has determined that the undistributed earnings of certain of its subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested to fund current and future growth of the related businesses. as management does not intend to use the earnings of these subsidiaries as a source of funding for its u.s. operations, such earnings will not be distributed to the u.s. in the foreseeable future. for 2015, pretax earnings of $3.5 billion were generated and will be indefinitely reinvested in these subsidiaries. at december31, 2015, the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these subsidiaries were $34.6 billion. if the firm were to record a deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, the amount would be $8.2 billion at december31, 2015.these undistributed earnings are related to subsidiaries located predominantly in the u.k. where the 2015 statutory tax rate was 20.25%.affordable housing tax creditsthe firm recognized $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense under the current period presentation during these years was $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $989 million, respectively. the carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the firms consolidated balance sheets, was $7.7 billion and $7.3 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the firms consolidated balance sheets, was $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.deferred taxes deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. deferred tax assets are recognized if, in managements judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. the significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table as of december31, 2015 and 2014.december 31, (in millions)20152014deferred tax assetsallowance for loan

december31, 2015, total u.s. federal nol carryforwards were approximately $5.2 billion, state and local nol carryforwards were $509 million, and non-u.s. nol carryforwards were $288 million. if not utilized, the u.s. federal nols will expire between 2025 and 2034 and the state and local and non-u.s. nol carryforwards will expire between 2016 and 2017. non-u.s. tax credit carryforwards were $704 million and will expire by 2023.the valuation allowance at december31, 2015, was due to losses associated with non-u.s. subsidiaries.286jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportunrecognized tax benefitsat december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, jpmorgan chases unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $3.5 billion, $4.9 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of which $2.1 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the consolidated statements of income. these unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated u.s. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. jpmorgan chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the internal revenue service as summarized in the tax examination status table below. as jpmorgan chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as approximately $800 million. upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit balance would result from payment or income statement recognition.the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

the comptroller of the currency. the bank is a member of the u.s. federal reserve system, and its deposits in the u.s. are insured by the fdic.the federal reserve requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a federal reserve bank. the average required amount of reserve balances deposited by the firms bank subsidiaries with various federal reserve banks was approximately $14.4 billion and $10.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.restrictions imposed by u.s. federal law prohibit jpmorgan chase & co. (parent company) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the parent company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate, (collectively referred to as covered transactions), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiarys total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiarys total capital.the principal sources of jpmorgan chases income (on a parent company-only basis) are dividends and interest from jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of jpmorgan chase. in addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the federal reserve, the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) and the fdic have authority under the financial institutions supervisory act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.at january1, 2016, jpmorgan chases banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $25 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. the capacity to pay dividends in 2016 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries earnings during the year.in compliance with rules and regulations established by u.s. and non-u.s. regulators, as of december31, 2015 and 2014, cash in the amount of $12.6 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively, were segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers. also, as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had receivables within other assets of $16.2 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively, consisting of cash deposited with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers. securities with a fair value of $20.0 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. in addition, as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had other restricted cash of $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, primarily representing cash reserves held at non-u.s. central banks and held for other general purposes.note 28  regulatory capital the federal reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firms national banks, including jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and chasebankusa,n.a.basel iii capital rules, for large and internationally active u.s. bank holding companies and banks, including the firm and its insured depository institution (idi) subsidiaries, revised, among other things, the definition of capital and introduced a new common equity tier 1 capital (cet1 capital) requirement. basel iii presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (rwa), a general (standardized) approach, which replaced basel i rwa effective january 1, 2015 (basel iii standardized) and an advanced approach, which replaced basel ii rwa (basel iii advanced); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. certain of the requirements of basel iii are subject to phase-in periods that began on january 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (transitional period). there are three categories of risk-based capital under the basel iii transitional rules: cet1 capital, as well as tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital. cet1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders equity (including capital for aoci related to debt and equity securities classified as afs as well as for defined benefit pension and opeb plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, msrs and deferred tax assets that arise from nol and tax credit carryforwards. tier 1 capital predominantly consists of cet1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. tier 2 capital includes long-term debt qualifying as tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. total capital is tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital.288jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportthe following tables present the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for jpmorgan chase and its significant national bank subsidiaries under both basel iii standardized transitional and basel iii advanced transitional at december 31, 2015 and 2014.  jpmorgan chase & co.(f)basel iii standardized transitionalbasel iii advanced transitional(in millions, except ratios)dec31, 2015dec31, 2014dec31, 2015dec31, 2014regulatory capitalcet1 capital$175,398$164,426$175,398$164,426tier 1 capital(a)200,482186,263200,482186,263total capital234,413221,117224,616210,576assetsrisk-weighted(b)1,465,2621,472,6021,485,3361,608,240adjusted  average(c)2,361,1772,464,9152,361,1772,464,915capital ratios(d)cet112.0%11.2%11.8%10.2%tier 1(a)13.712.613.511.6total16.015.015.113.1tier 1 leverage(e)8.57.68.57.6jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.(f)basel iii standardized transitionalbasel iii advanced transitional(in millions, except ratios)dec31, 2015dec31, 2014dec31, 2015dec31, 2014regulatory capitalcet1 capital$168,857$156,567$168,857$156,567tier 1 capital(a)169,222156,891169,222156,891total capital183,262173,322176,423166,326assetsrisk-weighted(b)1,264,0561,230,3581,249,6071,330,175adjusted  average(c)1,913,4481,968,1311,913,4481,968,131capital ratios(d)cet113.4%12.7%13.5%11.8%tier 1(a)13.412.813.511.8total14.514.114.112.5tier 1 leverage(e)8.88.08.88.0chase bank usa, n.a.(f)basel iii standardized transitionalbasel iii advanced transitional(in millions, except ratios)dec31, 2015dec31, 2014dec31, 2015dec31, 2014regulatory capitalcet1 capital$15,419$14,556$15,419$14,556tier 1 capital(a)15,41914,55615,41914,556total capital21,41820,51720,06919,206assetsrisk-weighted(b)105,807103,468181,775157,565adjusted  average(c)134,152128,111134,152128,111capital ratios(d)cet114.6%14.1%8.5%9.2%tier 1(a)14.614.18.59.2total20.219.811.012.2tier 1 leverage(e)11.511.411.511.4(a)at december31, 2015, trust preferred securities included in basel iii tier 1 capital were $992 million and $420 million for jpmorgan chase and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., respectively. at december31, 2015 chase bank usa, n.a. had no trust preferred securities.(b)effective january 1, 2015, the basel iii standardized rwa is calculated under the basel iii definition of the standardized approach. prior periods were based on basel i (inclusive of basel 2.5).(c)adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the tier 1 leverage ratio, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, less deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets, defined benefit pension plan assets, and deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards.(d)for each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the firm and its national bank subsidiaries are evaluated against the basel iii approach, standardized or advanced, resulting in the lower ratio (the collins floor), as required by the collins amendment of the dodd-frank act.

capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both non-taxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. the firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from non-taxable business combinations of $105 million and $130 million at december31, 2015, and 2014, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion at december31, 2015, and 2014, respectively.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report289notes to consolidated financial statementsunder the risk-based capital guidelines of the federal reserve, jpmorgan chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of cet1, tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the federal reserve to take action. bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital

lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. as a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the firms view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. to provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. see note 15 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. the following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at december31, 2015 and 2014. the amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. the firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. the firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. in addition, the firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. the firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 290jpmorgan chase &

and $150 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in note 3. in addition, at december31, 2015 and 2014, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.(j)for lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for

extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. the firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged finance activities, which were $32.1 billion and $23.4 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. for further information, see note 3 and note 4.the firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the u.s. tri-party repurchase transaction market. in its role as settlement and custody bank, the firm is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. this exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that the firm extends to its clients (i.e. cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the firms intra-day credit risk to the facility amountand must be repaid by the end of the day. as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $2.9 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively.guarantees u.s. gaap requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. u.s. gaap defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third partys failure to perform under a specified agreement. the firm considers the following offbalance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under u.s. gaap: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. as required by u.s. gaap, the firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). for certain types of guarantees, the firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. for indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. for these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the firms risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is recognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable. the contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). the recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at december31, 2015 and 2014, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below. standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees standby letters of credit (sblc) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. the carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $550 million and $672million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets; these carrying values included $123 million and $118million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $427 million and $554 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset. the following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings

been revised to conform with current period presentation.292jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportsecurities lending indemnifications through the firms securities lending program, customers securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. as part of this program, the firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. to minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. if a borrower defaults, the firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending customer with the cash equivalent thereof. derivatives qualifying as guarantees in addition to the contracts described above, the firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under u.s. gaap. these contracts include written put options that require the firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. the firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. the terms of written put options are typically five years or less. derivatives deemed to be guarantees also include contracts such as stable value derivatives that require the firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterpartys reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. stable value derivatives, commonly referred to as stable value wraps, are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio and are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the firm to terminate the contract under certain conditions. derivatives deemed to be guarantees are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in trading assets and trading liabilities. the total notional value of the derivatives that the firm deems to be guarantees was $53.8 billion and $53.6 billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the notional amount generally represents the firms maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. however, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $28.4 billion and $27.5billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $3.0 billion and $2.9billion at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the firm will be required to perform under the contract. the fair value of derivatives that the firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $236 million and $102million and derivative receivables of $14 million and $22million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. in addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. for a further discussion of credit derivatives, see note 6.unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreementsin the normal course of business, the firm enters into reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements, which are secured financing agreements. such agreements settle at a future date. at settlement, these commitments result in the firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. the firm also enters into repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. at settlement, these commitments result in the firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. these agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. these agreements predominantly consist of agreements with regular-way settlement periods. for a further discussion of securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, and securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned, see note 13.loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications mortgage repurchase liability in connection with the firms mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with u.s. gses, as described in note 16, the firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. the firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify u.s. gses (e.g., with make-whole payments to reimburse u.s. gses for their realized losses on liquidated loans). to the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. generally, the maximum amount of future payments the firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related spes) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense. the carrying values of the repurchase liabilities were $148 million and $275 million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.private label securitizationsthe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the firm in establishing its litigation reserves. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report293notes to consolidated financial statementson november 15, 2013, the firm announced that it had reached a $4.5 billion agreement with 21 major institutional investors to make a binding offer to the trustees of 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by j.p.morgan, chase, and bear stearns (rmbs trust settlement) to resolve all representation and warranty claims, as well as all servicing claims, on all trusts issued by j.p. morgan, chase, and bear stearns between 2005 and 2008. for further information see note 31.in addition, from 2005 to 2008, washington mutual made certain loan level representations and warranties in connection with approximately $165 billion of residential mortgage loans that were originally sold or deposited into private-label securitizations by washington mutual. of the $165 billion, approximately $81 billion has been repaid. in addition, approximately $50 billion of the principal amount of such loans has liquidated with an average loss severity of 59%. accordingly, the remaining outstanding principal balance of these loans as of december31, 2015, was approximately $33 billion, of which $6 billion was 60 days or more past due. the firm believes that any repurchase obligations related to these loans remain with the fdic receivership. for additional information regarding litigation, see note 31.loans sold with recourse the firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. in nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). in recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as fannie mae or freddie mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. the firms securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. at december31, 2015 and 2014, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $4.3 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. the carrying value of the related liability that the firm has recorded, which is representative of the firms view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $82 million and $102 million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. other off-balance sheet arrangements indemnification agreements  general in connection with issuing securities to investors, the firm may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that require the firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law or an adverse interpretation of tax law. in certain cases, the contract also may include a termination clause, which would allow the firm to settle the contract at its fair value in lieu of making a payment under the indemnification clause. the firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (software licensees) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (third-party purchasers), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. it is difficult to estimate the firms maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the firm that have not yet occurred. however, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. card charge-backs commerce solutions, cards merchant services business, is a global leader in payment processing and merchant acquiring. under the rules of visa usa, inc., and mastercard international, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., is primarily liable for the amount of each processed card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute between a cardmember and a merchant. if a dispute is resolved in the cardmembers favor, commerce solutions will (through the cardmembers issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. if commerce solutions is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, commerce solutions will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember. commerce solutions mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other security. however, in the unlikely event that: (1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a refund; (2) commerce solutions does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to provide customer refunds; and (3) commerce solutions does not have sufficient financial resources to provide customer refunds, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., would recognize the loss. commerce solutions incurred aggregate losses of $12 million, $10 million, and $14 million on $949.3 billion, $847.9 billion, and $750.1 billion of aggregate volume processed for the years ended december31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. incurred losses from merchant charge-backs are charged to other expense, with the offset recorded in a valuation allowance against accrued interest and accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. the carrying value of the valuation allowance was $20 million and $4 million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which the firm believes, based on historical experience and the collateral held by commerce solutions of $136 million and $174 million at december31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is representative of the payment or performance risk to the firm related to charge-backs. 294jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportclearing services  client credit risk the firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative transactions, with ccps, including etds such as futures and options, as well as otc-cleared derivative contracts. as a clearing member, the firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant ccp or client in whole or part. there are two types of margin. variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients derivative contracts. initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. as clearing member, the firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the ccps. where possible, the firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. the firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. in the event of non-performance by a client, the firm would close out the clients positions and access available margin. the ccp would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the firm as a clearing member. the firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin payables or receivables to clients and ccps, but does not reflect the clients underlying securities or derivative contracts on its consolidated financial statements. it is difficult to estimate the firms maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. however, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the firm, management believes it is unlikely that the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. for information on the derivatives that the firm executes for its own account and records in its consolidated financial statements, see note 6.exchange & clearing house memberships the firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the u.s. and other countries, and it provides clearing services. membership in some of these organizations requires the firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. such obligations vary with different organizations. these obligations may be limited to members who dealt with the defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the firms contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. alternatively, these obligations may be a full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. additionally, certain clearing houses require the firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses resulting from the clearing houses investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member.generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. it is difficult to estimate the firms maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the firm that have not yet occurred. however, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. guarantees of subsidiariesin the normal course of business, jpmorgan chase & co. (parent company) may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the firms counterparties. the obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the firms consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the parent company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. the firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the parent company under these guarantees is remote. the parent company has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes. these guarantees are not included in the table on page 291 of this note. for additional information, see note 21.jpmorgan chase financial company llc (jpmfc), a direct, 100%-owned finance subsidiary of the parent company, was formed on september 30, 2015, for the purpose of issuing debt and other securities in offerings to investors. any securities issued by jpmfc will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company, and these guarantees will rank on a parity with the firms unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.as of december 31, 2015, no securities had been issued by jpmfc.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report295notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 30  commitments, pledged assets and collaterallease commitments at december31, 2015, jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes, and for energy-related tolling service agreements. certain leases contain renewal options or escalation clauses providing for increased rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, or they require the firm to perform restoration work on leased premises. no lease agreement imposes restrictions on the firms ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. the following table presents required future minimum rental payments under operating leases with

borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements. certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the consolidated balance sheets. at december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had pledged assets of $385.6 billion and $324.5 billion, respectively, at federal reserve banks and fhlbs. in addition, as of december31, 2015 and 2014, the firm had pledged $50.7 billion and $60.1 billion, respectively, of financial assets that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated vies; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. see note 16 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated vies. for additional information on the firms securities

& co./2015 annual reportnote 31  litigationcontingenciesas of december31, 2015, the firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. the litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the firms lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.the firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $3.6 billion at december31, 2015. this estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. for certain matters, the firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made. the firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, particularly proceedings that could result from government investigations. accordingly, the firms estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.set forth below are descriptions of the firms material legal proceedings.auto dealer regulatory matter. the u.s. department of justice (doj) is investigating potential statistical disparities in markups charged to borrowers of different races and ethnicities by automobile dealers on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by the firm.cio litigation. the firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder class action, a consolidated putative class action brought under the employee retirement income security act (erisa) and seven shareholder derivative actions brought in delaware state court and in new york federal and state courts relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the firms chief investment office (cio). a settlement of the shareholder class action, under which the firm will pay $150 million, has been preliminarily approved by the court. the putative erisa class action has been dismissed, and plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. six of the seven shareholder derivative actions have been dismissed.credit default swaps investigations and litigation. in july 2013, the european commission (the ec) filed a statement of objections against the firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (cds) marketplace. the ec asserted that between 2006 and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the international swaps and derivatives association (isda) and markit group limited (markit) to foreclose exchanges from the potential market for exchange-traded credit derivatives. in december 2015, the ec announced the closure of its investigation as to the firm and other investment banks.separately, the firm and other defendants have entered separate agreements to settle a consolidated putative class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of purchasers and sellers of cds. the complaint in this action had alleged that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the firm, as well as markit and/or isda, collectively prevented new entrants into the market for exchange-traded cds products. these settlements are subject to court approval.custody assets investigation. the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) has closed its previously-reported investigation concerning compliance by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., london branch and j.p. morgan europe limited with the fcas rules regarding the provision of custody services relating to the administration of client assets.foreign exchange investigations and litigation. the firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (fx) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. fx-related investigations and inquiries by other, non-u.s. government authorities, including competition authorities, remain ongoing, and the firm is cooperating with those matters.the firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by u.s.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the u.s. class action). in january 2015, the firm entered into a settlement agreement in the u.s. class action. following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted fx futures and options on futures (the exchanged-based actions), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the consumer actions), and participants or beneficiaries of qualified erisa plans (the erisa actions). in july 2015, the plaintiffs in the u.s. class action filed an amended complaint, and the court consolidated the exchange-based jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report297notes to consolidated financial statementsactions into the u.s. class action. the firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated u.s. class action, including the exchange-based actions, and that agreement is subject to court approval. the consumer actions and erisa actions remain pending.in september 2015, two class actions were filed in canada against the firm as well as a number of other fx dealers, principally for alleged violations of the canadian competition act based on an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of currency purchased in the fx market. the first action was filed in the province of ontario, and seeks to represent all persons in canada who transacted any fx instrument. the second action seeks to represent only those persons in quebec who engaged in fx transactions.general motors litigation. jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. participated in, and was the administrative agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated term loan facility (term loan) for general motors corporation (gm).in july 2009, in connection with the gm bankruptcy proceedings, the official committee of unsecured creditors of motors liquidation company (creditors committee) filed a lawsuit against jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., in its individual capacity and as administrative agent for other lenders on the term loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a ucc-3 termination statement relating to the term loan. in march 2013, the bankruptcy court granted jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the creditors committees complaint on the grounds that jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. did not authorize the filing of the ucc-3 termination statement at issue. the creditors committee appealed the bankruptcy courts dismissal of its claim to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit. in january 2015, the court of appeals reversed the bankruptcy courts dismissal of the creditors committees claim and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the creditors committee as to the termination statement. the proceedings in the bankruptcy court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and the value of additional collateral on the term loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. in addition, certain term loan lenders filed cross-claims against jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. in the bankruptcy court seeking indemnification and asserting various claims.interchange litigation. a group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that visa and mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. the parties have entered into an agreement to settle the cases for a cash payment of $6.1 billion to the class plaintiffs (of which the firms share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. the agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card networks rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. in december 2013, the court issued a decision granting final approval of the settlement. a number of merchants appealed, and oral argument was held in september 2015. certain merchants and trade associations have also filed a motion with the district court seeking to set aside the approval of the class settlement on the basis of alleged improper communications between one of mastercards former outside counsel and one of plaintiffs outside counsel. that motion remains pending. certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against visa and mastercard, as well as against the firm and other banks. defendants motion to dismiss those actions was denied in july 2014.investment management litigation. the firm is defending two pending cases that are being coordinated for pre-trial purposes, alleging that investment portfolios managed by j.p. morgan investment management (jpmim) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. plaintiffs assured guaranty (u.k.) and ambac assurance uk limited claim that jpmim is liable for total losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. discovery has been completed. in january 2016, plaintiffs filed a joint partial motion for summary judgment in the coordinated actions.lehman brothers bankruptcy proceedings. in may 2010, lehman brothers holdings inc. (lbhi) and its official committee of unsecured creditors (the committee) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york that asserted both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and sought, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion in collateral (after deducting $700 million of returned collateral) that was transferred to jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. in the weeks preceding lbhis bankruptcy. the amended complaint also sought unspecified damages on the grounds that jpmorgan chase bank, n.a.s collateral requests hastened lbhis bankruptcy. the bankruptcy court dismissed the claims in the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the firm during september 2008, but did not dismiss the other claims, including claims for duress and fraud. the firm filed counterclaims against lbhi, including alleging that lbhi fraudulently induced the firm to make large extensions of credit against inappropriate collateral in connection with the firms role as the clearing bank for lehman brothers inc. (lbi), lbhis broker-dealer subsidiary. these extensions of credit left the firm with more than $25 billion in claims against the estate of lbi, which was repaid principally through collateral posted by lbhi and lbi. in september 2015, the district court, to which the case had been transferred from the bankruptcy court, granted summary judgment in favor 298jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportof jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. on most of the claims against it that the bankruptcy court had not previously dismissed, including the claims for duress and fraud. the district court also denied lbhis motion for summary judgment on certain of its claims and for dismissal of the firms counterclaims. the claims that remained following the district courts ruling challenged the propriety of the firms post-petition payment, from collateral posted by lbhi, of approximately $1.9 billion of derivatives, repo and securities lending claims.in the bankruptcy court proceedings, lbhi and several of its subsidiaries that had been chapter 11 debtors had filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by jpmorgan chase entities to recover on the claims. in january 2015, lbhi filed claims objections with respect to guaranty claims asserted by the firm arising from close-outs of derivatives transactions with lbi and one of its affiliates, and a claim objection with respect to derivatives close-out claims acquired by the firm in the washington mutual transaction.in january 2016, the parties reached an agreement, approved by the bankruptcy court, under which the firm will pay $1.42 billion to settle all of the claims, counterclaims and claims objections, including all appeal rights, except for the claims specified in the following paragraph. one pro se objector is seeking to appeal the settlement.the settlement did not resolve the following remaining matters: in the bankruptcy court proceedings, lbhi and the committee filed an objection to the claims asserted by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. against lbhi with respect to clearing advances made to lbi, principally on the grounds that the firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for its claims in a commercially reasonable manner. in january 2015, lbhi brought two claims objections relating to securities lending claims and a group of other smaller claims. discovery with respect to these objections is ongoing.libor and other benchmark rate investigations and litigation. jpmorgan chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the doj, the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc), the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and various state attorneys general, as well as the ec, the fca, the canadian competition bureau, the swiss competition commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the british bankers association (bba) in connection with the setting of the bbas london interbank offered rate (libor) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the european banking federation (ebf) in connection with the setting of the ebfs euro interbank offered rates (euribor) and to the japanese bankers association for the setting of tokyo interbank offered rates (tibor), as well as processes for the setting of u.s. dollar isdafix rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. the firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. as previously reported, the firm has resolved ec inquiries relating to yen libor and swiss franc libor. in may 2014, the ec issued a statement of objections outlining its case against the firm (and others) as to euribor, to which the firm has filed a response and made oral representations. other inquiries have been discontinued without any action against jpmorgan chase, including by the fca and the canadian competition bureau.in addition, the firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various united states district courts, in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the u.s. dollar libor, yen libor, swiss franc libor, euroyen tibor and/or euribor rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in u.s. dollar libor, yen libor, swiss franc libor, euroyen tibor or euribor and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. these matters are in various stages of litigation.the u.s. dollar libor-related putative class actions and most u.s. dollar libor-related individual actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the united states district court for the southern district of new york. the court dismissed certain claims, including the antitrust claims, and permitted other claims under the commodity exchange act and common law to proceed. certain plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the antitrust claims, and the united states court of appeals for the second circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. in january 2015, the united states supreme court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, holding that plaintiffs have the jurisdictional right to appeal, and remanded the case to the court of appeals for further proceedings. the court of appeals heard oral argument on remand in november 2015.the firm is one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and icap conspired to manipulate the u.s. dollar isdafix rates. plaintiffs primarily assert claims under the federal antitrust laws and commodities exchange act.madoff litigation. various subsidiaries of the firm, including j.p. morgan securities plc, have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in bankruptcy court in new york arising out of the liquidation proceedings of fairfield sentry limited and fairfield sigma limited, so-called madoff feeder funds. jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report299notes to consolidated financial statementsthese actions seek to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling approximately $155 million. all but two of these actions have been dismissed.in addition, a putative class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against jpmorgan chase in the united states district court for the southern district of new york, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against the firm and certain subsidiaries to an already pending putative class action in the same court. the allegations in these complaints largely track those previously raised -- and resolved as to the firm -- by the court-appointed trustee for bernard l. madoff investment securities llc. the district court dismissed these complaints and the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the district courts decision. the united states supreme court denied plaintiffs petition for a writ of certiorari in march 2015. plaintiffs subsequently served a motion in the court of appeals seeking to have the court reconsider its prior decision in light of another recent appellate decision. that motion was denied in june 2015.the firm is a defendant in five other madoff-related individual investor actions pending in new york state court. the allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. in august 2014, the court dismissed all claims against the firm. in january 2016, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal.a putative class action was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested) in madoffs ponzi scheme and were not included in a prior class action settlement. these plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, federal and state racketeering statutes and multiple common law and statutory claims including breach of trust, aiding and abetting embezzlement, unjust enrichment, conversion and commercial bad faith. a similar action was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida, although it was not styled as a class action, and included claims pursuant to florida statutes. the firm moved to transfer both the florida and new jersey actions to the united states district court for the southern district of new york. the florida court denied the transfer motion, but subsequently granted the firms motion to dismiss the case in september 2015. plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal, which is pending. in addition, the same plaintiffs have re-filed their dismissed state claims in florida state court. the new jersey court granted the transfer motion to the southern district of new york, and the firm has moved to dismiss the case pending in new york.three shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in new york federal and state court against the firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the firms relationship with bernard madoff and the alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions. the actions seek declaratory relief and damages. all three actions have been dismissed. the plaintiff in one action did not appeal, the dismissal has been affirmed on appeal in another action, and one appeal remains pending.mortgage-backed securities and repurchase litigation and related regulatory investigations. the firm and affiliates (together, jpmc), bear stearns and affiliates (together, bear stearns) and certain washington mutual affiliates (together, washington mutual) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (mbs). these cases include actions by individual mbs purchasers and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of mbs offerings. following the settlements referred to below, there are currently pending and tolled investor claims involving mbs with an original principal balance of approximately $4.2 billion, of which $2.6 billion involves jpmc, bear stearns or washington mutual as issuer and $1.6 billion involves jpmc, bear stearns or washington mutual solely as underwriter. the firm and certain of its current and former officers and board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the firms mbs activities, and trustees have asserted or have threatened to assert claims that loans in securitization trusts should be repurchased.issuer litigation  class actions. jpmc has fully resolved all pending putative class actions on behalf of purchasers of mbs.issuer litigation  individual purchaser actions. the firm is defending individual actions brought against jpmc, bear stearns and washington mutual as mbs issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own mbs offerings). the firm has settled a number of these actions. several actions remain pending in federal and state courts across the u.s. and are in various stages of litigation.monoline insurer litigation. the firm has settled two pending actions relating to a monoline insurers guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of 11 different bear stearns mbs offerings. this settlement fully resolves all pending actions by monoline insurers against the firm relating to rmbs issued and/or sponsored by the firm.underwriter actions. in actions against the firm involving offerings where the firm was solely an underwriter of other issuers mbs offerings, the firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. however, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct. currently there is one such action pending against the firm relating to a single offering of another issuer.repurchase litigation. the firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees, securities administrators or 300jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportmaster servicers of various mbs trusts on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. these cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys fees and costs and other remedies. deutsche bank national trust company, acting as trustee for various mbs trusts, has filed such a suit against jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and the federal deposit insurance corporation (the fdic) in connection with a significant number of mbs issued by washington mutual; that case is described in the washington mutual litigations section below. other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more mbs transactions issued by jpmc and/or bear stearns, are in various stages of litigation.in addition, the firm and a group of 21 institutional mbs investors made a binding offer to the trustees of mbs issued by jpmc and bear stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion and the implementation of certain servicing changes by jpmc, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to 330 mbs trusts created between 2005 and 2008. the offer does not resolve claims relating to washington mutual mbs. the trustees (or separate and successor trustees) for this group of 330 trusts have accepted the settlement for 319 trusts in whole or in part and excluded from the settlement 16 trusts in whole or in part. the trustees acceptance is subject to a judicial approval proceeding initiated by the trustees and pending in new york state court. the judicial approval hearing was held in january 2016, and the parties are awaiting a decision. an investor in some of the trusts for which the settlement has been accepted has intervened in the judicial approval proceeding to challenge the trustees allocation of the settlement among the trusts. separately, in october 2015, jpmc reached agreements to resolve repurchase and servicing claims for four trusts among the 16 that were previously excluded from the trustee settlement. in december 2015, the court approved the trustees decision to accept these separate settlements. the trustees are seeking to obtain certain remaining approvals necessary to effectuate these settlements.additional actions have been filed against third-party trustees that relate to loan repurchase and servicing claims involving trusts sponsored by jpmc, bear stearns and washington mutual.derivative actions. shareholder derivative actions relating to the firms mbs activities have been filed against the firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its board of directors, in new york state court and california federal court. two of the new york actions have been dismissed, one of which is on appeal. a consolidated action in california federal court has been dismissed without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction and plaintiffs are pursuing discovery relating to jurisdiction.government enforcement investigations and litigation. the firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the dojs criminal division and two united states attorneys offices relating to mbs offerings securitized and sold by the firm and its subsidiaries. the firm has also received subpoenas and informal requests for information from state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of mbs-related matters. the firm continues to respond to these mbs-related regulatory inquiries.in addition, the firm continues to cooperate with investigations by the doj, including the united states attorneys office for the district of connecticut, and by the sec division of enforcement and the office of the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief program, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in residential and commercial mbs.the firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased mbs that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. there is no assurance that the firm will not be named as a defendant in additional mbs-related litigation.mortgage-related investigations and litigation. one shareholder derivative action has been filed in new york supreme court against the firms board of directors alleging that the board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the firm regarding mortgage servicing. in december 2014, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and in january 2016, the dismissal was affirmed on appeal.the civil division of the united states attorneys office for the southern district of new york is conducting an investigation concerning the firms compliance with the fair housing act and equal credit opportunity act in connection with its mortgage lending practices. in addition, three municipalities have commenced litigation against the firm alleging violations of an unfair competition law or the fair housing act. the municipalities seek, among other things, civil penalties for the unfair competition claim, and, for the fair housing act claims, damages resulting from lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. two of the municipal actions are stayed, and a motion to dismiss is pending in the remaining action.in march 2015, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a entered into a settlement agreement with the executive office for united states bankruptcy trustees and the united states trustee program (collectively, the bankruptcy trustee) to resolve issues relating to mortgage payment change notices and escrow statements in bankruptcy proceedings. in january 2016, the occ determined that, among other things, the mortgage payment change notices issues that were the subject of the settlement with the bankruptcy trustee violated the 2011 mortgage servicing-related consent order jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report301notes to consolidated financial statementsentered into by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and the occ (as amended in 2013 and 2015), and assessed a $48 million civil money penalty. the occ concurrently terminated that consent order.municipal derivatives litigation. several civil actions were commenced in new york and alabama courts against the firm relating to certain jefferson county, alabama (the county) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. the claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the county and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the county. the county filed for bankruptcy in november 2011. in june 2013, the county filed a chapter 9 plan of adjustment, as amended (the plan of adjustment), which provided that all the above-described actions against the firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. in november 2013, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of adjustment, and in december 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the plan of adjustment. all conditions to the plan of adjustments effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the plan of adjustment occurred in december 2013. accordingly, all the above-described actions against the firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the plan of adjustment. the appeal of the bankruptcy courts order confirming the plan of adjustment remains pending. petters bankruptcy and related matters. jpmorgan chase and certain of its affiliates, including one equity partners (oep), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to thomas j. petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, petters) and the polaroid corporation. the principal actions against jpmorgan chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three petters entities. these actions generally seek to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by petters of polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by oep; (ii) two credit facilities that jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions entered into with polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by petters. the actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the petters bankruptcy trustees.proprietary products investigations and litigation. in december 2015, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and j.p. morgan securities llc agreed to a settlement with the sec, and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. agreed to a settlement with the cftc, regarding disclosures to clients concerning conflicts associated with the firms sale and use of proprietary products, such as j.p. morgan mutual funds, in the firms wealth management businesses, and the u.s. private banks disclosures concerning the use of hedge funds that pay placement agent fees to jpmorgan chase broker-dealer affiliates. as part of the settlements, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and j.p. morgan securities llc paid penalties, disgorgement and interest totaling approximately $307 million. the firm continues to cooperate with inquiries from other government authorities concerning disclosure of conflicts associated with the firms sale and use of proprietary products. a putative class action filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on behalf of financial advisory clients from 2007 to the present whose funds were invested in proprietary funds and who were charged investment management fees, was dismissed by the court. plaintiffs appeal of the dismissal is pending.referral hiring practices investigations. various regulators are investigating, among other things, the firms compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and other laws with respect to the firms hiring practices related to candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials, and its engagement of consultants in the asia pacific region. the firm is responding to and cooperating with these investigations.washington mutual litigations. proceedings related to washington mutuals failure are pending before the united states district court for the district of columbia and include a lawsuit brought by deutsche bank national trust company, initially against the fdic and amended to include jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain washington mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements. the case includes assertions that jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. in june 2015, the court ruled in favor of jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. on the question of whether the firm or the fdic bears responsibility for washington mutual banks repurchase obligations, holding that jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. assumed only those liabilities that were reflected on washington mutual banks financial accounting records as of september 25, 2008, and only up to the amount of the book value reflected therein. the fdic is appealing that ruling and the case has otherwise been stayed pending the outcome of that appeal.certain holders of washington mutual bank debt filed an action against jpmorgan chase which alleged that by acquiring substantially all of the assets of washington mutual bank from the fdic, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. caused washington mutual bank to default on its bond obligations. jpmorgan chase and the fdic moved to dismiss this action and the district court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs claim that jpmorgan chase tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs bond contracts with washington mutual bank prior to its closure. the action has 302jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual reportbeen stayed pending a decision on jpmorgan chases motion to dismiss the plaintiffs remaining claim.jpmorgan chase has also filed complaints in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the fdic, in its corporate capacity as well as in its capacity as receiver for washington mutual bank, asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the purchase & assumption agreement between jpmorgan chase and the fdic relating to jpmorgan chases purchase of most of the assets and certain liabilities of washington mutual bank.wendel. since 2012, the french criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of wendel investissement (wendel) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in wendel. jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of wendel in 2007. in april 2015, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. was notified that the authorities were formally investigating the role of its paris branch in the transactions, including alleged criminal tax abuse. jpmorgan chase is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. in addition, civil proceedings have been commenced against jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. by a number of the managers. the claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.*     *     *in addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings and inquiries. the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and inquiries, and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. additional legal proceedings and inquiries may be initiated from time to time in the future.the firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. in accordance with the provisions of u.s. gaap for contingencies, the firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the firm incurred legal expense of $3.0 billion, $2.9 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. there is no assurance that the firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. jpmorgan chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firms consolidated financial condition. the firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chases income for that period.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual report303notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 32  international operationsthe following table presents income statement- and balance sheet-related information for jpmorgan chase by major international geographic area. the firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the u.s., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, or the location of the trading desk. however, many of the firms u.s. operations serve international businesses.as the firms operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between u.s. and international operations. these estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the firms segment reporting as set forth in note 33.the firms long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. the majority of the firms long-lived assets are located in the u.s.as of or for the year ended december 31, (in

nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, dividends), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. jpmorgan chase grants restricted stock and rsus to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.personal bankers: retail branch office personnel who acquire, retain and expand new and existing customer relationships by assessing customer needs and recommending and selling appropriate banking products and services.jpmorgan chase & co./2015 annual

commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives.purchased credit-impaired (pci) loans: represents loans that were acquired in the washington mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the financial accounting standards board (fasb). the guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, ltv ratios, fico scores, past due status, geographic location). a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.real assets: real assets include investments in productive assets such as agriculture, energy rights, mining and timber properties and exclude raw land to be developed for real estate purposes.real estate investment trust (reit): a special purpose investment vehicle that provides investors with the ability to participate directly in the ownership or financing of real-estate related assets by pooling their capital to purchase and manage income property (i.e., equity reit) and/or mortgage loans (i.e., mortgage reit). reits can be publicly-or privately-held and they also qualify for certain favorable tax considerations.receivables from customers: primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.reported basis: financial statements prepared under u.s. gaap, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.retained loans: loans that are held-for-investment (i.e., excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).revenue wallet: proportion

basel iii establishes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating rwa (a standardized approach and an advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of basel iii advanced, also operational risk. key differences in the calculation of credit risk rwa between the standardized and advanced approaches are that for basel iii advanced, credit risk rwa is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for basel iii standardized, credit risk rwa is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. market risk rwa is calculated on a generally consistent basis between basel iii standardized and basel iii advanced, both of which incorporate the requirements set forth in basel 2.5.sales specialists: retail branch office and field personnel, including relationship managers and loan officers, who specialize in marketing and sales of various business banking products (i.e., business loans, letters of credit, deposit accounts, commerce solutions, etc.) and mortgage products to existing and new clients.seed capital:

states.taxable-equivalent basis: in presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.troubled debt restructuring (tdr): a tdr is deemed to occur when the firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.unaudited: financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.u.s. gaap: accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.u.s. government-sponsored enterprises (u.s. gses) and u.s. gse obligations:

of 2014, the firm recorded a $291 million adjustment to reduce the pci allowance and the recorded investment in the firms pci loan portfolio, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of interest
