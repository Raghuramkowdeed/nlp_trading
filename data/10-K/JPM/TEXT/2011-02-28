PART I

ITEM 1: BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN CHASE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.), WITH $2.1 TRILLION IN ASSETS, $176.1 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

AND OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANK WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN 23 STATES, AND

CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE BANK USA, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANK THAT

IS THE FIRMS CREDIT CARDISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (JPMORGAN SECURITIES), THE FIRMS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK

AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES

AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH

ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM

8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION

15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS

FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND

OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO SIX BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE

INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENTS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES SEGMENTS.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR

RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A), BEGINNING ON

PAGE 67 AND IN NOTE 34 ON PAGES 290291.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING

COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES,

LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES AND

ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE

QUALITY AND RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION AND PRICE.

COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES

SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY;

WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO

DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS

REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED

AND, IN SOME CASES, FAILED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD

RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A

BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL

BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL

PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE

APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM

DOES BUSINESS.

RECENT EVENTS AFFECTING THE FIRM.

ON JULY 21, 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW THE DODD-FRANK

WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE DODD-FRANK ACT) WHICH WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT

STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



VOLCKER RULE

. THE DODD-FRANK ACTS VOLCKER RULE PROHIBITS BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS

JPMORGAN CHASE, FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RESTRICTS THEIR

OWNERSHIP OF, INVESTMENT IN OR SPONSORSHIP OF, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS.



DERIVATIVES

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES MARKET, INCLUDING STRICT CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, CENTRAL CLEARING OF

STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES, AND HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES DEALERS AND MAJOR MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE. THE DODD-FRANK

ACT ALSO REQUIRES BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURE THEIR

DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGING THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH SUCH BUSINESSES

ARE CONDUCTED.



DEBIT INTERCHANGE

. THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS REQUIRED TO RESTRICT THE INTERCHANGE FEES

PAYABLE ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.



CAPITAL

. THE TREATMENT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY

CAPITAL PURPOSES WILL BE PHASED OUT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD, BEGINNING IN 2013. FOR MORE

INFORMATION, SEE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BELOW.



FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND ASSESSMENTS

. THE FDIC IS REQUIRED TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO

REVISE THE ASSESSMENT BASE FOR THE CALCULATION OF BANKING INDUSTRY ASSESSMENTS,

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

WHICH SUPPORT THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

FUND. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE DEPOSIT INSURANCE BELOW.



BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ESTABLISHES A BUREAU OF

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION HAVING BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, PAYMENT

AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NARROW THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL

PREEMPTION OF STATE CONSUMER LAWS AND EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO BRING

ACTIONS TO ENFORCE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION.



HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

. THE

DODD-FRANK ACT CREATES A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND

SUBJECTS THEM TO HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT,

RESOLUTION PLAN, CONCENTRATION LIMIT, AND CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORT REQUIREMENTS. BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN ASSETS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE, ARE CONSIDERED

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT. IF THE REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF

THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL

STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE REGULATORS HAVE THE POWER TO REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO

SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES.



CONCENTRATION LIMITS

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESTRICTS ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES IF,

AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED

10% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT INSTRUCTS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO CONDUCT

APPROXIMATELY 285 RULEMAKINGS AND 130 STUDIES AND REPORTS. THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES INCLUDE THE

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE CFTC); THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE

SEC); THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD); THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (THE OCC); THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

(THE FDIC); THE NEW BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION (THE CFPB); AND THE NEW FINANCIAL

STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC).

OTHER PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL APPLY TO NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, SUCH AS J.P. MORGAN

SECURITIES LTD., THE FIRMS U.K. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY.

IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME WHAT FORM ALL OF THE RULEMAKINGS WILL TAKE, OR WHAT NEW PROPOSALS MAY

BE MADE. THE DESCRIPTION BELOW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE FIRM

OPERATES, WHICH COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE STRUCTURE OF THE FIRM AND THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS COULD ALSO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT.

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF

MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA). UNDER

REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT

THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE

DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE

REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY

ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. SO LONG AS THE DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

MEET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT REQUIREMENTS, THE FIRM IS PERMITTED TO

CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN

UNAFFILIATED BANK. PURSUANT TO THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF

1994 (THE RIEGLE-NEAL ACT), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR SUCH AN

ACQUISITION WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAW OF ANY STATE,

PROVIDED THAT THE ACQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANY, BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION, DOES NOT CONTROL

MORE THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. OR

MORE THAN 30% (OR SUCH GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNTS AS PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW) OF THE TOTAL

DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACQUIRED BANK HAS ITS HOME

OFFICE OR A BRANCH. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESTRICTS ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES

IF, AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED 10%

OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR AND

CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON

THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE

BANK USA, N.A., ARE REGULATED BY THE OCC. SEE OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW FOR A

FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT. IN

ADDITION, UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL REMAIN THE REGULATOR OF JPMORGAN

CHASE, AND WILL BE IMPOSING HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS IN ITS ROLE AS THE REGULATOR OF

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL

BANKS. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AS NATIONAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT

BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE

RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF

THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS

UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGE 273 FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2011, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND

THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN

THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND

PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS ISSUED SUPERVISORY GUIDANCE REQUIRING BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO CONSULT WITH FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD STAFF BEFORE TAKING

ACTIONS, SUCH AS INCREASING DIVIDENDS, IMPLEMENTING COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS OR REDEEMING

OR REPURCHASING CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. SUCH GUIDANCE PROVIDES FOR A SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT

PROGRAM THAT OUTLINES FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING THE PROCESSES THAT SUCH BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THEY HOLD ADEQUATE CAPITAL UNDER ADVERSE

CONDITIONS TO MAINTAIN READY ACCESS TO FUNDING. THE PROCEDURES REQUIRE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN AND DEMONSTRATION THAT THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL MEET PROPOSED BASEL

III REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING THE BASEL III FULLY PHASED-IN 7% TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY

TARGET AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO PROPOSED DIVIDEND INCREASES OR OTHER CAPITAL ACTIONS. THE FIRM IS

CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A CAPITAL ASSESSMENT REVIEW PURSUANT TO THIS SUPERVISORY PROGRAM.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFFBALANCE SHEET

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO RISK-WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED

FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED

INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED

THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER

THE GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL

TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF

THESE GUIDELINES, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES 273274.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE

LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS. THE MINIMUM

LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD GUIDELINES OR WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE

FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON

THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I). IN 2004, THE BASEL

COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO

PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL

COMMITTEE FINALIZED FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE ACCORD (BASEL III) WHICH NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF

CAPITAL, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES, INTRODUCED SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

COVERAGE AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AND ESTABLISHED AN INTERNATIONAL LEVERAGE RATIO. IN ADDITION,

THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE PUBLISHED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PROPOSED RISK-BASED CAPITAL

FLOORS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT BASEL I FLOOR

UNDER BASEL II/BASEL III CALCULATIONS. FOR FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, SEE

PAGES 102104.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, THE SEC AUTHORIZED JPMORGAN SECURITIES TO USE THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF

COMPUTING NET CAPITAL FOR BROKER/DEALERS THAT ARE PART OF CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITIES AS

DEFINED BY SEC RULES. ACCORDINGLY, JPMORGAN SECURITIES MAY CALCULATE DEDUCTIONS FOR MARKET RISK

USING ITS INTERNAL MARKET RISK MODELS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

102104.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL

ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE.

HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF ANY BANK SUBSIDIARY. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES,

THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL RESTORATION

PLAN FOR ITS UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN

DEPOSITS, WHICH INSURANCE IS FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAVE

DRAMATICALLY INCREASED RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FDIC AND DEPLETED THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND. IN

ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR INSURED DEPOSITS HAS BEEN INCREASED GENERALLY

FROM $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR TO $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR, AND UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2013, THE COVERAGE FOR NON-INTEREST BEARING DEMAND DEPOSITS IS UNLIMITED. IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED

STRESS ON THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND CAUSED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A

STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE THE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC

IMPOSED A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT IN JUNE 2009, HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS

GENERALLY, AND REQUIRED INSURED INSTITUTIONS TO PREPAY ON DECEMBER 30, 2009 THE PREMIUMS THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BECOME DUE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES THE FDIC TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO CHANGE THE BASE FOR CALCULATING

ASSESSMENTS FROM DEPOSITS TO ASSETS MINUS TANGIBLE EQUITY. IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE FDIC ISSUED A

FINAL RULE CHANGING THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE ASSESSMENT RATE. THESE

CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THE FIRMS BANK

SUBSIDIARIES PAY TO THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR THE FIRM.

UPON THE

INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, THE FDIC WILL BE APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR

RECEIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT. IN SUCH AN INSOLVENCY, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER.



TO TRANSFER ANY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS;



TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR



TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION IS A PARTY.

THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASES

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE

BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED

BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC) HAVE PRIORITY

OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND

DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH

SUCH INSTITUTION BEING IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS

CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST

SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHERE A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN

CHASE, IS IN DEFAULT OR DANGER OF DEFAULT, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED RECEIVER IN ORDER TO CONDUCT

AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION OF SUCH SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE FDIC IS IN THE

PROCESS OF PROPOSING RULES TO IMPLEMENT ITS ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY. WHILE THE FDIC MAY HAVE POWERS AS RECEIVER SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE DETAILS OF THOSE POWERS ARE THE SUBJECT OF

THE PROPOSED RULES.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT (BSA) REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.

THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH AND SUSPICIOUS

ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE DILIGENCE/KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THE

FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH BSA

REQUIREMENTS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES

TO SUPPORT THESE SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY.

EFFECTIVE JULY 2011, PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT CODIFY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS POLICY,

AND REQUIRE A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT

BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE

PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE

DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE

DIVESTITURE.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW

ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES.

THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK

SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER

LIMITS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGE 273. EFFECTIVE IN 2012, THE DODD-FRANK ACT

EXTENDS SUCH RESTRICTIONS TO DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE

DODD-FRANK ACTS VOLCKER RULE IMPOSES SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BANKING

ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND HEDGE FUNDS OR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS FOR

WHICH THE BANKING ENTITY SERVES AS THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, INVESTMENT ADVISOR OR SPONSOR.

THE FIRMS BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL

REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN

CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE

RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS

OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AND IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, AMONG OTHER POWERS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

THROUGH JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK

EXCHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMILAR SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.), THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE

CONDUCTED BY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD., WHICH IS REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY OF

THE U.K. THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC.

THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND

ARE REGISTERED ACCORDINGLY.

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, THREE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS FUTURES

COMMISSION MERCHANTS, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE EITHER REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS COMMODITY POOL

OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS OR EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRMS U.S. ENERGY BUSINESS

IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER

EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION BOTH IN

THE U.S. AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY.

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CFTC AND SEC WILL BE THE REGULATORS OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES

BUSINESSES. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE CFTC

AND SEC AS SWAPS DEALERS OR SECURITY-BASED SWAPS DEALERS.

THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT

OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AND

CARD ACTS

,

AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON CONSUMER LOAN

ORIGINATION AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE NEW CFPB WILL BE RESPONSIBLE

FOR RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT PURSUANT TO SUCH STATUTES.

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED

PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT

TO THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS, AND THE

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN

THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN GLBA.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION

ON PAGE 157. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER

REPORTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES,

INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE

CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF

CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE HEALTH

OF U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS CAN AFFECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

THE FIRMS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES; THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS; THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND,

THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; AND THE WILLINGNESS OF

FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED

BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE FIRM MAY HAVE TRADING POSITIONS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY

OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

FIRMS SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND

EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES, MARKETS CREDIT SPREADS, AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT

REVENUE RELATING TO ITS TRADING AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL AFFECT PRICING OR THE ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS, AND

THAT THIS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN

IN SECURITIES MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES

OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUE. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET

CONCERNS MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRMS FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE

OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, SUB-PAR

PERFORMANCE BY THE FIRMS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD CAUSE OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE;

CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. ANY DETERIORATION IN THESE

CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR

INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES OR PERSISTENT HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, COULD LEAD TO AN

INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH

CAN REDUCE THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASES LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL

CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE

OTHERWISE DISRUPTED, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS

THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN

SELLING OR

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET

OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED

BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR

CONFIDENCE AND RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE

FIRMS COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH

AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS, AND

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE

FIRMS ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS OR MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING DEBT, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING

OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY

CURTAILING THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS

OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENTS COULD ALSO

IMPAIR THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE FIRM

BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM,

STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES,

AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES

FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED

IN THE FUTURE. SUCH DOWNGRADES MAY COME AT TIMES

OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY, WHEN THE FIRMS OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS ARE MORE LIMITED

AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH

FLOW AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER

REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN

THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD REDUCE ITS LIQUIDITY

POSITION.

SOME GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING LARGE BANKS TO

INCORPORATE A SEPARATE SUBSIDIARY IN EVERY COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND TO MAINTAIN

INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY FOR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. IF ADOPTED, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD

DECREASE THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND INCREASE THE RISK OF ITS LIQUIDITY POSITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, INCLUDING

RECENTLY-ADOPTED LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL

AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH

OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE FIRM DOES

BUSINESS, MAY RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES, LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS

PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR MAKE OFFERING ITS PRODUCTS TO CLIENTS MORE EXPENSIVE.

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADOPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULATIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT WAS ADOPTED IN

2010 AND WILL EFFECT SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS

LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS: THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION WHICH WILL HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THE FIRM OFFERS; THE CREATION OF A STRUCTURE TO

REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE POWER TO

REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES IF THE REGULATORS

DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND

SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES; MORE COMPREHENSIVE

REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET, INCLUDING PROVIDING FOR HIGHER CAPITAL AND

MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES, AND

HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION OF ALL OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALERS AND MAJOR MARKET PARTICIPANTS,

INCLUDING THE FIRM; SO-CALLED PUSH OUT PROVISIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANTLY

RESTRUCTURE OR RESTRICT ITS DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, CHANGE THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH SUCH

BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED, OR LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE COLLATERAL, MARGIN AND OTHER RISKS;

PROHIBITIONS ON THE FIRM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RESTRICTING ITS OWNERSHIP OF,

INVESTMENT IN OR SPONSORSHIP OF, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS; RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERCHANGE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS; AND A REQUIREMENT THAT BANK

REGULATORS PHASE OUT THE TREATMENT OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR

REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES.

THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS CREATED A EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD TO MONITOR FINANCIAL STABILITY

AND IMPLEMENTED RULES THAT WILL INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRADING INSTRUMENTS OR

EXPOSURES AND IMPOSE COMPENSATION LIMITS ON CERTAIN EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE EU COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER INITIATIVES, INCLUDING NEW

LEGISLATION THAT WILL AFFECT DERIVATIVES TRADING, IMPOSE SURCHARGES ON GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FIRMS AND POSSIBLY IMPOSE NEW LEVIES ON BANK BALANCE SHEETS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2010 REVISIONS TO ITS CAPITAL

ACCORD, WHICH WILL REQUIRE HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS, NARROW THE DEFINITION OF

CAPITAL, AND INTRODUCE SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. ALSO

BEING CONSIDERED IS THE IMPOSITION OF A BANK SURCHARGE ON INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE

GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD INCREASE THE FIRMS FUNDING

AND OPERATIONAL COSTS.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE AND ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES, AND ANY

REQUIRED CHANGES TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM SUCH LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS,

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE, LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING, AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE

FIRM HOLDS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS,

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS WOULD

NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE

FUTURE.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO ITS

OPERATIONS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES

IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND

ENFORCEMENT HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. AS THIS REGULATORY TREND CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASES CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WERE TO DETERIORATE, MORE OF JPMORGAN CHASES CUSTOMERS MAY

BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR IN REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM

PURCHASE ASSETS FROM OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING TO ITS CLIENTS

AND COUNTERPARTIES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF THE FIRMS COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO

CONCERNS IN THE MARKET ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY,

THEREBY EXACERBATING THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES (INCLUDING

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES) THAT THE FIRM COULD INCUR IN ITS TRADING AND CLEARING BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT

RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING

PERIODS OF MARKET ILLIQUIDITY. DURING SUCH PERIODS, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER

INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES

THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO

THE FIRM. IN ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY, AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008

AND EARLY 2009, MAY OCCUR AGAIN AND COULD PRODUCE LOSSES IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REALIZE UPON

COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS

PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR

HEDGE ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, INCREASED CONCENTRATION WITHIN THE FIRMS SECURITIES OR LOAN PORTFOLIOS, OR IN OTHER

POSITIONS THAT THE FIRM MAY HOLD, MAY OCCUR FOR REASONS OUTSIDE OF THE FIRMS CONTROL. DISRUPTIONS

IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRMS INABILITY TO

SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE

INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRMS POSITIONS NOT ONLY INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE FIRMS BALANCE

SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO

THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM

HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE

THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK,

INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE

FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF THE FIRMS RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES CHANGE AND GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH

THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP

SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED,

MONITORED OR MANAGED. IN ADDITION, IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRMS

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING

TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF

SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRMS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES, LENDING COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT

ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, THE FIRM HAS EXPOSURES ARISING FROM ITS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS EARNINGS. THE FIRM

ESTABLISHES RESERVES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES

PART I

INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THE FIRM ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER METHODS TO DETERMINE THE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET

EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE

DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT

IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER

OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT THE FIRM

WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE

IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND

OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET

VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS

NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A TRADING

INSTRUMENT SUCH AS A DERIVATIVE. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL

SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE

FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME

FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN

SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY

BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A

DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES. IN PARTICULAR, DISPUTES

REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD

FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, AND

IMPAIR THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THE FIRMS HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN

HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON

MANAGEMENTS SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED

INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR

UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE

ASSURANCE THAT ITS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE FIRMS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR

STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY,

POLITICAL, LEGAL AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE

ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE

PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE RETURN EARNED ON

THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO MATERIALLY DECREASE THE

VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES,

POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND

MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES) ARE BEYOND THE

FIRMS CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES ON THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN

SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE

POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND

A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN CERTAIN

EMERGING MARKETS.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY

BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE

FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE

VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE

COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRMS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH

UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL

AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED,

OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON

OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS OR MAY CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND

THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN

THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THAT COUNTRY OR

REGION, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG

OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. IN 2010, CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,

INCLUDING GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN, REGARDING PERCEIVED WEAKNESSES IN THEIR

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONDITION, AND HOW SUCH WEAKNESSES MIGHT AFFECT OTHER ECONOMIES AS WELL AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, WHICH LENT FUNDS TO OR DID BUSINESS WITH OR IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOAN REPURCHASE AND INDEMNITY

OBLIGATIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS (WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT RECOURSE), THE

ORIGINATOR IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A VARIETY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BOTH

THE ORIGINATOR AND THE LOANS BEING SOLD OR SECURITIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE AND SOME OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THOSE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, HAVE MADE SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND

SECURITIZATION OF LOANS, AND THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WHEN IT SECURITIZES LOANS IT HAS

ORIGINATED. IF A LOAN THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IS SOLD OR

SECURITIZED, THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN AND INCUR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS

DIRECTLY, OR THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSSES. IN 2010,

THE COSTS OF REPURCHASING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SOLD TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS FANNIE

MAE AND FREDDIE MAC (THE GSES) INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH COSTS

COULD NOT CONTINUE TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY, REPURCHASE

OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO THE GSES OR TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM RECORDS WITH RESPECT TO ITS LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS IS

ESTIMATED BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE

REPURCHASE DEMANDS MADE BY PURCHASERS, THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE

REPURCHASES DEMANDS, AND THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE. WHILE THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT REPURCHASE LIABILITY RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE, THE FACTORS REFERRED TO ABOVE

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN LIGHT OF MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER

CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH RESERVES MAY BE INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES LITIGATION RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS NOT

SOLD TO THE GSES. THE FIRM SEPARATELY EVALUATES ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH LITIGATION IN ESTABLISHING ITS

LITIGATION RESERVES. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESERVES IN RESPECT OF SUCH

LITIGATION MATTERS ARE ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RESERVES WILL NOT NEED TO BE

INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ENSURING THAT IT SATISFIES REQUIREMENTS

RELATING TO MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES.

IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF

OBTAINING MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE JUDGMENTS IN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT REQUIRE A JUDICIAL

FORECLOSURE PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM EXTENDED THIS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION TO FORECLOSURE SALES

IN THOSE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT REQUIRE A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS, AND TO FORECLOSURES

AND FORECLOSURE SALES IN THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING

STATES WHERE A JUDICIAL PROCESS IS NOT REQUIRED,

BUT WHERE AN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS PART OF THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS. IN MID-OCTOBER, THE FIRM ALSO TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED EVICTIONS IN THE STATES AND

TERRITORIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD SUSPENDED FORECLOSURES AND FORECLOSURE SALES, AS WELL AS IN

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL STATES IN WHICH AN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN

CONNECTION WITH EVICTION PROCEEDINGS.

THIS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION AROSE OUT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS PREPARED BY LOCAL

FORECLOSURE COUNSEL, SIGNED BY FIRM EMPLOYEES, AND FILED OR USED IN MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS IN CERTAIN STATES. BASED ON THE FIRMS WORK TO DATE, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE

INFORMATION IN THOSE AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS ABOUT THE FACT OF DEFAULT AND AMOUNT OF

INDEBTEDNESS WAS MATERIALLY ACCURATE. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING REVIEW AND VERIFICATION OF THIS

INFORMATION WAS PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THE AFFIANTS, OR THE AFFIDAVITS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

PROPERLY NOTARIZED. THE FIRM HAS SINCE RESUMED FILING NEW FORECLOSURE ACTIONS IN MOST OF THE STATES

IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD PREVIOUSLY HALTED SUCH ACTIONS, USING REVISED PROCEDURES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE EXECUTION OF THE AFFIDAVITS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE USED IN THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS,

AND THE FIRM INTENDS TO RESUME FILING NEW FORECLOSURE ACTIONS IN ALL REMAINING STATES. THE FIRM IS

ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING PENDING FORECLOSURE MATTERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REMEDIATION

OF PREVIOUSLY FILED AFFIDAVITS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS IS NECESSARY, AND THE FIRM

INTENDS TO RESUME PENDING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AS THE REVIEW, AND IF NECESSARY, REMEDIATION, OF

EACH PENDING MATTER IS COMPLETED.

THE FIRM EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EFFORTS TO CORRECT

AND ENHANCE ITS MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES. MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY MORTGAGE SERVICING COMPANIES AND BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS AFFILIATES,

RELATING TO FORECLOSURE

AND LOSS MITIGATION PROCESSES.

THE FIRM IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS,

AND THESE INVESTIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL FINES, PENALTIES, EQUITABLE REMEDIES

(INCLUDING REQUIRING DEFAULT SERVICING OR OTHER PROCESS CHANGES), OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL COSTS IN RESPONDING TO GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ADDITIONAL LITIGATION.

THE FIRM CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE IMPACT THAT THEY COULD HAVE ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND

LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES,

INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER,

EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO ENGAGED IN

POWER GENERATION AND HAS INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING

AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND

IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY, AND TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER

REVENUES FROM THE FIRMS COMMODITIES

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS

IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. FURTHERMORE,

LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS.

THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC

SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN

PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF

OPERATIONS. THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

OUTSIDE OF THE FIRMS CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT,

TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY

THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW

MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE FIRMS ACTIONS TO

MITIGATE ITS RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS

EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND

THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT

TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASES REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN

CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

HARM TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS

SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR

REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, OR A FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

FAIRLY, CAN RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ALL

OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST REVENUE, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND HARM TO REPUTATION FOR THE FIRM.

ADVERSE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRMS

PROSPECTS. ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR

INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRMS REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN

TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRMS REPUTATION OCCUR,

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO

ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING RISE TO THE REPUTATIONAL HARM COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS

EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRMS CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO

DEAL WITH THE FIRM, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS CAUSE SERIOUS

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A

LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF ONE OF ITS EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS

A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES

THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE

SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH

PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, INCREASED

OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE FIRMS

POSSESSION WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT

PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER BY FAULT OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR

COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY

THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY

OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRMS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES,

ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE

FIRMS PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING

FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE

RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT

DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. AS PROCESSES

ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR

IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE RISK

THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

COULD PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT,

AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED

BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY

RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASES INABILITY TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITIVE

CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

PRODUCES LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF

OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND

COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES

PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER

INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. THE FIRMS BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE

BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS

MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO

LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE

EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO

EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS

FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF

THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER

BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED

POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED

TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMBINED ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION EFFORTS

COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS

OR RESULTS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY INTEGRATION EFFORTS IN CONNECTION WITH

ACQUISITIONS ALREADY CONSUMMATED OR ANY NEW ACQUISITIONS WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF

UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN THE DISRUPTION OF THE FIRMS ONGOING

BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, DEPOSITORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION

WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

ITS BUSINESS, AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRMS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON THE

FIRM OR ITS EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN EXISTING AND PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS OR TAXES ON EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF

INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING

IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AND RESERVES RELATED TO

LITIGATIONS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS,

REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE

LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, AS THEY ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION

AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

AND

SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR

ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE

MATERIAL LOSSES.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

JPMORGAN CHASES HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY AT 270 PARK AVENUE, A 50-STORY OFFICE

BUILDING OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THIS LOCATION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF

SPACE. THE BUILDING IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A MAJOR RENOVATION.

THE DESIGN SEEKS TO ATTAIN THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY RATING FOR RENOVATIONS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS

UNDER THE LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEM. THE

TOTAL RENOVATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED IN 2011.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER IN 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED 383 MADISON AVENUE IN

NEW YORK CITY, A 45-STORY, 1.1 MILLION SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE BUILDING ON LAND WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A

GROUND LEASE THROUGH 2096. THIS BUILDING SERVES AS THE U.S. HEADQUARTERS OF JPMORGAN CHASES

INVESTMENT BANK. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE BUILDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN NOTE 30, ON PAGE 278.

IN TOTAL, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNED OR LEASED APPROXIMATELY 12.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL

OFFICE SPACE AND RETAIL SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OWN OR LEASE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN CHICAGO,

ILLINOIS (3.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET); HOUSTON AND DALLAS, TEXAS (3.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET); COLUMBUS,

OHIO (2.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET); PHOENIX, ARIZONA (1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET); JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY

(1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET); AND 5,268 RETAIL BRANCHES IN 23 STATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM

OCCUPIED APPROXIMATELY 68.2 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF SPACE IN THE UNITED STATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM ALSO MANAGED AND OCCUPIED APPROXIMATELY 5.6 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE

FEET OF SPACE IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNED OR LEASED APPROXIMATELY 4.7

MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE AND OWNED A 424,000 SQUARE-FOOT OPERATIONS CENTER. IN DECEMBER

2010, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED A 999-YEAR LEASEHOLD INTEREST IN 25 BANK STREET IN LONDONS CANARY

WHARF. WITH 1.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE, 25 BANK STREET WILL BECOME THE NEW EUROPEAN

HEADQUARTERS OF THE INVESTMENT BANK IN 2012. IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AGREED TO PURCHASE 60

VICTORIA EMBANKMENT IN 2011, A 518,000 SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE BUILDING THE FIRM HAS BEEN LEASING SINCE

1991. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE BUILDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN NOTE 30, ON PAGE 278.

IN 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED A 999-YEAR LEASEHOLD INTEREST IN LAND AT LONDONS CANARY WHARF AND

ENTERED INTO A BUILDING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP THE SITE AND CONSTRUCT A EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS

BUILDING. HOWEVER, ACQUISITION OF 25 BANK STREET ALLOWS THE FIRM TO

ACCELERATE BY FOUR YEARS THE

CONSOLIDATION OF ITS INVESTMENT BANK PERSONNEL IN ONE LOCATION. IN DECEMBER 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE

SIGNED AN AMENDED BUILDING AGREEMENT TO ALLOW CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE CANARY WHARF SITE FOR

FUTURE USE. THE AMENDED TERMS EXTEND THE BUILDING AGREEMENT TO OCTOBER 30, 2016.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL

FACILITIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF OWNERSHIP

AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS, AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY 5.3 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF SPACE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010. JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LEASE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN INDIA (1.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET) AND THE PHILIPPINES (1.0 MILLION SQUARE

FEET).

THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES. JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE

REQUIREMENTS AND MAY DETERMINE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CERTAIN OF ITS PREMISES AND FACILITIES ARE NO

LONGER NECESSARY FOR ITS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF

ANY SUCH EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS.

SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OCCUPANCY EXPENSE, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION ON PAGES

5963.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEFENDANTS OR PUTATIVE DEFENDANTS IN

MORE THAN 10,000 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THE FORM OF REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS PRIVATE, CIVIL LITIGATIONS. THE LITIGATIONS

RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS INVOLVING A

SINGLE PLAINTIFF TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WITH POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF CLASS MEMBERS.

INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVE BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS, BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND

SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE AT VARYING STAGES OF ADJUDICATION,

ARBITRATION OR INVESTIGATION, AND INVOLVE EACH OF THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND

A WIDE VARIETY OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING COMMON LAW TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AND STATUTORY ANTITRUST,

SECURITIES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS), SOME OF WHICH PRESENT NOVEL CLAIMS OR LEGAL THEORIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY

OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IT INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN ALL SUCH MATTERS.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF

RESERVES ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS FROM $0 TO

APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2010. THIS ESTIMATED AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES IS BASED UPON CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

FIRMS BEST ESTIMATE OF SUCH LOSSES FOR THOSE CASES FOR WHICH

SUCH ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE. FOR CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN CURRENTLY BE MADE. THE FIRMS

ESTIMATE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, GIVEN THE VARYING STAGES OF

THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY

IN PRELIMINARY STAGES), THE EXISTENCE OF

MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) IN MANY OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS WHOSE SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS

YET TO BE DETERMINED, THE NUMEROUS YET-UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MANY OF

THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING ISSUES REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND

THE SCOPE OF MANY OF THE CLAIMS), AND THE

ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FIRMS ESTIMATE WILL CHANGE FROM

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL LOSSES MAY BE MORE THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATE.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED OF ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. THE FIRM ACCRUES FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM SUCH PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EACH QUARTER TO ASSESS ITS

LITIGATION RESERVES, AND MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IN SUCH RESERVES, UPWARDS OR DOWNWARDS, AS APPROPRIATE,

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST JUDGMENT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE MATTERS PRESENT NOVEL

LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM

CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE CURRENTLY PENDING MATTERS WILL BE,

WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE

EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE

BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT

SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FIRM

NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES

CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE NOTE 32 ON PAGES 282289.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID ON APRIL 30, 2009, TO SHAREHOLDERS

OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009. THE ACTION ENABLED THE FIRM TO RETAIN APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION IN

COMMON EQUITY IN EACH OF 2010 AND 2009, AND WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE FIRM HAD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL

STRENGTH IN THE EVENT THE VERY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE BEGINNING OF 2009

STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE FIRM IS

AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK PLUS THE 88 MILLION

WARRANTS SOLD BY THE U.S. TREASURY IN 2009. DURING 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT

REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK OR WARRANTS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM

RESUMED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND DURING THE YEAR REPURCHASED AN

AGGREGATE OF 78 MILLION SHARES

FOR $3.0 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $38.49. THE FIRMS SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES IN

2010 WERE INTENDED TO OFFSET SHARECOUNT INCREASES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE

AWARDS AND WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GOAL OF MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE SHARECOUNT. THE FIRM

DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS DURING 2010. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, $3.2 BILLION OF

AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMON STOCK, AND ALL OF THE AUTHORIZED

REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE WARRANTS.

THE FIRM MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE

ITS EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING

COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE

DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE

ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION.

THE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT MANAGEMENTS

DISCRETION, AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND THE EXACT NUMBER OF SHARES AND WARRANTS PURCHASED IS

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED ON

THAT EVALUATION, THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED

THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE. SEE EXHIBITS 31.1 AND 31.2 FOR THE

CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY

NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE,

LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES  OR EVEN

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES  IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE. SEE PAGE 158 FOR MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO

MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS), AND BEAR STEARNS BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL ACQUISITION RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL, AND

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM RECORDED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. A PRELIMINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FINAL TOTAL EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS $2.0 BILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 166170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(E)

THE CALCULATION OF 2009 EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AND NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON EQUITY

INCLUDES A ONE-TIME, NONCASH REDUCTION OF $1.1 BILLION, OR $0.27 PER SHARE, RESULTING FROM

REPAYMENT OF U.S. TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (TARP) PREFERRED CAPITAL IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2009. EXCLUDING THIS REDUCTION, THE ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE WERE 7% AND 11%,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2009. THE FIRM VIEWS THE ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE, BOTH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES, AS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY ENABLE THE COMPARABILITY TO PRIOR PERIODS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES ON PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

THIS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF MD&A HIGHLIGHTS SELECTED INFORMATION AND MAY

NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO READERS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR A

COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS WELL AS THE CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY,

CREDIT, OPERATIONAL AND MARKET RISKS, AND THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES, AFFECTING THE FIRM AND

ITS VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS, THIS ANNUAL REPORT SHOULD BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2010 CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, AS SIGNS OF GROWTH AND STABILITY RETURNED TO

BOTH THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE YEAR BEGAN WITH A CONTINUATION OF THE

TRENDS SEEN AT THE END OF 2009: ALTHOUGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAD REACHED 10%, ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE

1983, SIGNS WERE EMERGING THAT DETERIORATION IN THE LABOR MARKETS WAS ABATING AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

WAS BEGINNING TO EXPAND. THE HOUSING SECTOR ALSO SHOWED SOME SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, WHICH WAS HELPED

BY A NEW ROUND OF HOME-BUYER CREDITS. OVERALL, DURING 2010, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO

IMPROVE AND THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW, THOUGH THE PACE OF GROWTH WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEANINGFULLY

AFFECT UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH, AT YEAR-END 2010, STOOD AT 9.4%. CONSUMER SPENDING EXPANDED AT A

MODERATE RATE EARLY IN THE YEAR AND ACCELERATED AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, AS HOUSEHOLDS CONTINUED TO

REDUCE DEBT AND INCREASE SAVINGS. BUSINESSES BEGAN TO SPEND AGGRESSIVELY, WITH OUTLAYS FOR

EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE EXPANDING AT A DOUBLE-DIGIT PACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY,

BUSINESSES CAUTIOUSLY ADDED TO PAYROLLS IN EVERY MONTH OF THE YEAR.

LOW INFLATION ALLOWED THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO MAINTAIN ITS ACCOMMODATIVE STANCE THROUGHOUT 2010, IN

ORDER TO HELP PROMOTE THE U.S. ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAINTAINED THE TARGET RANGE

FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT ZERO TO ONE-QUARTER PERCENT AND CONTINUED TO INDICATE THAT ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS WERE LIKELY TO WARRANT A LOW FEDERAL FUNDS RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD.

THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY PAUSED BRIEFLY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 AS CONCERNS

AROSE THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MEASURES TO ADDRESS THEIR WORSENING FISCAL

POSITIONS. EQUITY MARKETS FELL SHARPLY, AND BOND YIELDS TUMBLED. CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVELOPED

ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, PERSISTED THROUGHOUT 2010 AND HAVE CONTINUED INTO 2011.

HOWEVER, FEARS THAT THE U.S. RECOVERY WAS FALTERING PROVED UNFOUNDED, AND THE U.S. ECONOMY

CONTINUED TO GROW OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, GROWTH IN THE EMERGING

ECONOMIES REMAINED ROBUST. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED A PROGRAM TO

PURCHASE LONGER-TERM TREASURY SECURITIES THROUGH 2011 IN ORDER TO RESTRAIN INTEREST RATES AND BOOST

THE ECONOMY. THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COMBINED WITH RECORD U.S. CORPORATE PROFIT MARGINS AND RAPID

INTERNATIONAL GROWTH, CONTINUED TO SUPPORT STOCK MARKETS AS FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED

AND RISK SPREADS CONTINUED TO NARROW.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT DURING THE YEAR, JPMORGAN CHASE

REPORTED FULL-YEAR 2010 RECORD NET INCOME OF $17.4 BILLION, OR $3.96 PER SHARE, ON NET REVENUE OF $102.7

BILLION. NET INCOME WAS UP 48% COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $11.7 BILLION, OR $2.26 PER SHARE, IN

2009. RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 10% FOR THE YEAR, COMPARED WITH 6% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER

NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

REFLECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE

WAS DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO HIGHER SECURITIES GAINS IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, INCREASED

OTHER INCOME AND INCREASED PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CREDIT CARD

INCOME. THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE BENEFITED FROM AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT DURING 2010. COMPARED WITH

2009, DELINQUENCY TRENDS WERE MORE FAVORABLE AND ESTIMATED LOSSES WERE LOWER IN THE CONSUMER

BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH THEY REMAINED AT ELEVATED LEVELS. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IMPROVED. IN ADDITION, FOR THE

YEAR, NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE LOWER ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES, THOUGH THE LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE

FIRMS MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO REMAINED VERY HIGH AND CONTINUED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DRAG ON RETURNS.

THESE POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN CARD

SERVICES, THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES (EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS), AND IN THE INVESTMENT BANK AND COMMERCIAL BANKING. NEVERTHELESS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOAN PORTFOLIO IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES INCREASED, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES LARGELY

RELATED TO HOME EQUITY, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OPTION ARM LOANS. TOTAL FIRMWIDE CREDIT RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE $33.0 BILLION, RESULTING IN A FIRMWIDE LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO OF 4.5%

OF TOTAL LOANS.

STRONG CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS FOR GROWTH RESULTED IN GOOD RESULTS ACROSS

MOST OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING RECORD REVENUE AND NET INCOME IN COMMERCIAL BANKING,

RECORD REVENUE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SOLID RESULTS ACROSS MOST OTHER BUSINESSES. FOR THE YEAR,

THE INVESTMENT BANK RANKED #1 FOR GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING FEES; RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES ADDED

MORE THAN 150 NEW BRANCHES AND 5,000 SALESPEOPLE, AND OPENED MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION NET NEW CHECKING

ACCOUNTS; CARD SERVICES ROLLED OUT NEW PRODUCTS AND OPENED 11.3 MILLION NEW ACCOUNTS; TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES GREW ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY TO $16.1 TRILLION; AND ASSET MANAGEMENT REPORTED

RECORD LONG-TERM AUM NET INFLOWS OF $69 BILLION.

THE FIRM ALSO CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN ITS BALANCE SHEET DURING 2010, ENDING THE YEAR WITH A TIER 1

COMMON RATIO OF 9.8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 12.1%. TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER

31, 2010, WAS $176.1 BILLION.

THROUGHOUT 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BY PROVIDING CAPITAL,

FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY TO ITS CLIENTS IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD. DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM

LOANED OR RAISED CAPITAL OF MORE THAN $1.4 TRILLION FOR ITS CLIENTS, WHICH INCLUDED MORE THAN $10

BILLION OF CREDIT PROVIDED TO MORE THAN 250,000 SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE U.S., AN INCREASE OF MORE

THAN 50% OVER 2009. JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE OF ITS

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING HIRING MORE THAN 8,000 PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ALONE. THE FIRM REMAINS COMMITTED

TO HELPING HOMEOWNERS AND PREVENTING FORECLOSURES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2009, THE FIRM HAS

OFFERED 1,038,000 TRIAL MODIFICATIONS TO STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS. OF THE 285,000 MODIFICATIONS THAT THE FIRM HAS

COMPLETED, MORE THAN HALF WERE MODIFIED UNDER CHASE PROGRAMS, AND THE REMAINDER WERE OFFERED UNDER

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED OR AGENCY PROGRAMS.

ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CONTINUES TO FACE CHALLENGES, THERE ARE SIGNS OF STABILITY AND GROWTH RETURNING

TO BOTH THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE FIRM INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE

AND INVEST IN THE PRODUCTS THAT SUPPORT AND SERVE ITS CLIENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT DOES

BUSINESS.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR AND PRESENTS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS. MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S.

GAAP RESULTS AND, FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND THE FIRM AS A WHOLE, INCLUDES CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRED IT TO CONSOLIDATE ITS FIRM-SPONSORED

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; AS A RESULT, REPORTED AND MANAGED BASIS RELATING TO CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS ARE EQUIVALENT FOR PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION

OF THIS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, IN 2009 AND ALL OTHER

PRIOR PERIODS, U.S. GAAP RESULTS FOR CS AND THE

FIRM WERE ALSO ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUMED CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAD BEEN

SECURITIZED AND SOLD BY CS REMAINED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS (MANAGED

BASIS) HAD NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE OR BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, AS WELL AS OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY

MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, SEE

PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

INVESTMENT BANK

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUE AND HIGHER

NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND GAINS

OF $509 MILLION FROM THE WIDENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED AND DERIVATIVE

LIABILITIES (COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $2.3 BILLION ON THE TIGHTENING OF THE SPREAD ON THOSE

LIABILITIES IN THE PRIOR YEAR). THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN FIXED INCOME

MARKETS REVENUE AS WELL AS LOWER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A

BENEFIT IN 2010, COMPARED WITH AN EXPENSE IN 2009, AND REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES, LARGELY RELATED TO NET REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED,

DRIVEN BY HIGHER NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING INCREASED LITIGATION RESERVES, AS WELL AS

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

NET INCOME INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY A LOWER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND LOWER NET

REVENUE. NET REVENUE DECREASED, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES RELATED TO NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES), AND LOWER LOAN BALANCES.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT TO WIDER-SPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN

DEBIT CARD INCOME AND AUTO OPERATING LEASE INCOME. THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED FROM THE 2009 LEVEL, REFLECTING IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND REDUCED NET

CHARGE-OFFS. THE PROVISION ALSO REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES, PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE FOR MORTGAGE LOANS SERVICED, AND SALES FORCE

INCREASES IN BUSINESS BANKING AND BANK BRANCHES.

CARD SERVICES

REPORTED NET INCOME COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A LOWER PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN

BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME, REFLECTING LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, THE IMPACT OF

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND A DECREASED LEVEL OF FEES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A REDUCTION IN THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED AN

INCREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING

EXPENSE.

56

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL BANKING

REPORTED RECORD NET INCOME, DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES AND RECORD NET REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN LIABILITY

BALANCES, WIDER LOAN SPREADS, HIGHER NET GAINS FROM ASSET SALES, HIGHER LENDING-RELATED FEES, AN

IMPROVEMENT IN THE MARKET CONDITIONS IMPACTING THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE, AND

HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES; THESE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY SPREAD COMPRESSION ON LIABILITY

PRODUCTS AND LOWER LOAN BALANCES. RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE PURCHASE OF A $3.5

BILLION LOAN PORTFOLIO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED

FROM 2009 AND REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO

STABILIZATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND REFINEMENTS TO CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED SLIGHTLY, REFLECTING HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

TREASURY AND SECURITIES SERVICES

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER

NET REVENUE. WORLDWIDE SECURITIES SERVICES NET REVENUE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT, AS HIGHER MARKET LEVELS

AND NET INFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SPREADS IN SECURITIES LENDING, LOWER

VOLATILITY ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND LOWER BALANCES ON LIABILITY PRODUCTS. TREASURY SERVICES NET

REVENUE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT, AS LOWER SPREADS ON LIABILITY PRODUCTS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER TRADE

LOAN AND CARD PRODUCT VOLUMES. ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY GREW TO $16.1 TRILLION DURING 2010, AN 8% INCREASE.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR TSS INCREASED, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT

PLATFORMS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ON RECORD REVENUE, LARGELY OFFSET BY

HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE GROWTH IN NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET

LEVELS, NET INFLOWS TO PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS, HIGHER LOAN ORIGINATIONS, HIGHER DEPOSIT AND

LOAN BALANCES, AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER DEPOSIT SPREADS. ASSETS

UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED 8% DURING 2010 DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET VALUATIONS, RECORD

NET INFLOWS OF $69 BILLION TO LONG-TERM PRODUCTS, AND INFLOWS IN CUSTODY AND BROKERAGE PRODUCTS,

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NET OUTFLOWS FROM LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO

HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NONINTEREST

EXPENSE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE REFLECTED HIGHER

SECURITIES GAINS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIONS TAKEN TO REPOSITION THE CORPORATE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IN CONNECTION WITH MANAGING THE FIRMS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK, AND

HIGHER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME FROM

THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION

RESERVES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF A $675

MILLION FDIC SPECIAL ASSESSMENT IN 2009.

2011 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS NOTED ABOVE,

THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE THE FIRMS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE

SET FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SEE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ON PAGE 157 AND RISK

FACTORS ON PAGES 512 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2011 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S.

ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT,

CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES

WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. EACH OF THESE LINKED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM

AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS. ECONOMIC AND MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, SUCH AS MARKET AND CREDIT TRENDS,

CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR, CLIENT BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND COMPETITION, ARE ALL EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES. THE OUTLOOK FOR RFS AND CS, IN PARTICULAR, REFLECTS THE EXPECTED EFFECT OF

CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE U.S RELATING TO HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE CONTINUING STRESS

AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE HOUSING MARKETS. THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES WILL BE AFFECTED BY MARKET

LEVELS AND VOLUMES, WHICH ARE VOLATILE AND QUICKLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

IN THE

MORTGAGE BANKING, AUTO & OTHER CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS WITHIN RFS, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME TO BE $1 BILLION OR LESS FOR

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, GIVEN THE LEVELS OF MORTGAGE INTEREST

RATES AND PRODUCTION VOLUMES EXPERIENCED YEAR-TO-DATE. IF MORTGAGE

INTEREST RATES REMAIN AT CURRENT LEVELS OR RISE IN THE FUTURE, LOAN

PRODUCTION AND MARGINS COULD CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED

RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2011. IN ADDITION, REVENUE COULD

CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CONTINUED ELEVATED LEVELS OF REPURCHASES OF MORTGAGES

PREVIOUSLY SOLD, PREDOMINANTLY TO U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES (GSES). MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THAT REALIZED REPURCHASE LOSSES COULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN 2011. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM IS DEDICATING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS, CORRECT AND ENHANCE ITS MORTGAGE LOAN

FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES AND IS COOPERATING WITH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO ITS

PROCEDURES. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE

ISSUES.

IN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS BUSINESS WITHIN RFS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON THE CURRENT

OUTLOOK FOR DELINQUENCIES AND LOSS SEVERITY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TOTAL QUARTERLY NET CHARGE-OFFS

COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION DURING 2011. GIVEN CURRENT ORIGINATION AND PRODUCTION LEVELS,

COMBINED WITH MANAGEMENTS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF PORTFOLIO RUNOFF LEVELS, THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 10% TO 15% ANNUALLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE ANNUAL REDUCTIONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE NET INTEREST

INCOME IN EACH PERIOD, INCLUDING A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION IN 2011 FROM THE 2010

LEVEL; HOWEVER, OVER TIME THE REDUCTION IN NET INTEREST INCOME IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET

BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT COSTS AND LOWER EXPENSES. AS THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO RUN OFF,

MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OF CAPITAL MAY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

REDEPLOYMENT EACH YEAR, SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINING

PORTFOLIO.

ALSO, IN RFS, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS NONINTEREST EXPENSE IN 2011 TO REMAIN MODESTLY ABOVE 2010 LEVELS,

REFLECTING INVESTMENTS IN NEW BRANCH BUILDS AND SALES FORCE HIRES, AS WELL AS CONTINUED ELEVATED

SERVICING-, DEFAULT- AND FORECLOSED ASSET-RELATED COSTS.

IN CS, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS END-OF-PERIOD OUTSTANDINGS FOR THE CHASE PORTFOLIO (EXCLUDING THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO) TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN 2011. THIS DECLINE MAY BE AS MUCH AS $10

BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, REFLECTING BOTH CONTINUED PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF AND SEASONAL ACTIVITY.

THE DECLINE IN THE CHASE PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO BOTTOM OUT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, AND BY

THE END OF 2011, OUTSTANDINGS IN THE PORTFOLIO ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $120 BILLION AND

REFLECT A BETTER MIX OF CUSTOMERS. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO DECLINED TO APPROXIMATELY $14

BILLION AT THE END OF 2010, FROM $20 BILLION AT THE END OF 2009. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE TO $10 BILLION BY THE END OF 2011. THE EFFECT OF SUCH

REDUCTIONS IN THE CHASE AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIOS IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE 2011 NET INTEREST

INCOME IN CS BY APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION FROM THE 2010 LEVEL.

THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATES FOR BOTH THE CHASE AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS ARE

ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. IF CURRENT DELINQUENCY TRENDS CONTINUE, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

FOR THE CHASE PORTFOLIO (EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO) COULD BE BELOW 6.5% IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2011.

DESPITE THESE POSITIVE ECONOMIC TRENDS, RESULTS FOR RFS AND CS WILL DEPEND ON THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC DATA SEEN IN 2010 SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY

WAS NOT FALLING BACK INTO RECESSION, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND THE DIFFICULT HOUSING MARKET HAVE

BEEN PERSISTENT. EVEN AS CONSUMER LENDING NET CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES HAVE IMPROVED, THE

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO REMAINS UNDER STRESS. FURTHER DECLINES IN U.S. HOUSING PRICES AND

INCREASES IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAIN POSSIBLE; IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, RESULTS FOR BOTH RFS AND

CS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN IB, TSS AND AM, REVENUE WILL BE AFFECTED BY MARKET LEVELS, VOLUMES AND VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL

INFLUENCE CLIENT FLOWS AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND CUSTODY. IN ADDITION, IB AND CB

RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL INFLUENCE LEVELS OF

CHARGE-OFFS, REPAYMENTS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

IN PRIVATE EQUITY (WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT), EARNINGS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO

BE VOLATILE AND BE INFLUENCED BY CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, MARKET LEVELS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

BROADER ECONOMY AND INVESTMENT-SPECIFIC ISSUES. CORPORATES NET INTEREST INCOME LEVELS WILL

GENERALLY TREND WITH THE SIZE AND DURATION OF THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. CORPORATE NET

INCOME (EXCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, AND EXCLUDING MERGER-RELATED ITEMS, MATERIAL LITIGATION EXPENSES

AND SIGNIFICANT NONRECURRING ITEMS, IF ANY) IS ANTICIPATED TO TREND TOWARD A LEVEL OF APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION PER QUARTER.

FURTHERMORE, CONTINUED REPOSITIONING OF THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IN CORPORATE COULD

RESULT IN MODEST DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE FIRMS NET INTEREST MARGIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.

REGARDING REGULATORY REFORM, JPMORGAN CHASE INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FIRMS REGULATORS AS THEY

PROCEED WITH THE EXTENSIVE RULEMAKING REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL REFORM. THE FIRM WILL

CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO ACHIEVING IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY REFORMS IN A WAY

THAT PRESERVES THE VALUE THE FIRM DELIVERS TO ITS CLIENTS.

MANAGEMENT AND THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUALLY EVALUATE WAYS TO DEPLOY THE FIRMS STRONG

CAPITAL BASE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE. SUCH ALTERNATIVES COULD INCLUDE THE REPURCHASE

OF COMMON STOCK, INCREASING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND PURSUING ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THESE

ALTERNATIVES, AS APPROPRIATE, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2010 WAS $102.7 BILLION, UP BY $2.3 BILLION, OR 2%, FROM 2009. RESULTS FOR

2010 WERE DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITIES GAINS AND PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM AND ADMINISTRATION FEES IN TSS, AND

HIGHER OTHER INCOME IN SEVERAL BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CREDIT CARD INCOME.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES DECREASED FROM 2009 DUE TO LOWER EQUITY UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY FEES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES. COMPETITIVE MARKETS COMBINED WITH FLAT

INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING AND COMPLETED M&A VOLUMES, RESULTED IN LOWER EQUITY UNDERWRITING

AND ADVISORY FEES; WHILE STRONG INDUSTRY-WIDE LOAN SYNDICATION AND HIGH-YIELD BOND VOLUMES DROVE

RECORD DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES IN IB. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH

ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

6971 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF REVENUE FROM THE FIRMS TRADING AND PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2009. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS, WHICH HAD SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN 2010, COMPARED WITH A SMALL LOSS IN 2009,

REFLECTING IMPROVEMENTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. TRADING REVENUE DECREASED, REFLECTING LOWER RESULTS

IN CORPORATE, OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE IN IB PRIMARILY REFLECTING GAINS FROM THE WIDENING OF THE

FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE IB AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

6971 AND 89

90, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 7 ON PAGES 199200 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DECREASED IN 2010 FROM 2009 LEVELS, REFLECTING LOWER

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES IN RFS ASSOCIATED, IN PART, WITH NEWLY-ENACTED LEGISLATION RELATED TO

NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES; THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LENDING-RELATED

SERVICE FEES IN IB, PRIMARILY FROM GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME, AND IN CB, PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER

COMMITMENT AND LETTER-OF-CREDIT FEES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED

FEES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN IB, RFS, CB AND TSS, SEE SEGMENT

RESULTS FOR IB ON PAGES 6971,

RFS ON PAGES 7278, CB ON PAGES 8283 AND TSS ON PAGES

8485 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE INCREASED FROM 2009. THE INCREASE LARGELY

REFLECTED HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM, DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS, NET

INFLOWS TO PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE FEES; AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATION FEES

IN TSS, REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS AND NET INFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS IN IB, AS A RESULT OF LOWER

MARKET VOLUMES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS FOR AM ON PAGES 8688 AND TSS ON PAGES 8485 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES GAINS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE

REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND TO

REBALANCE EXPOSURE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SECURITIES GAINS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN

THE FIRMS CORPORATE SEGMENT, SEE THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 8990

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009, DRIVEN BY HIGHER MORTGAGE

PRODUCTION REVENUE, REFLECTING INCREASED MORTGAGE ORIGINATION VOLUMES IN RFS AND AM, AND WIDER

MARGINS, PARTICULARLY IN RFS. THIS INCREASE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER REPURCHASE LOSSES IN RFS

(RECORDED AS CONTRA-REVENUE), WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO

REPURCHASE DEMANDS, PREDOMINANTLY FROM GSES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN

RFS, SEE RFSS MORTGAGE BANKING, AUTO

& OTHER CONSUMER LENDING DISCUSSION ON PAGES 7477 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON REPURCHASE LOSSES, SEE THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 98101 AND NOTE 30

ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME DECREASED DURING 2010, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THAT REQUIRED THE FIRM TO CONSOLIDATE THE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW

GUIDANCE RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF ALL SERVICING FEES RECEIVED FROM FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS (WHICH WAS OFFSET BY RELATED INCREASES IN NET

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INTEREST INCOME AND THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AND THE ELIMINATION OF SECURITIZATION INCOME/(LOSSES) IN OTHER

INCOME). LOWER INCOME FROM OTHER FEE-BASED PRODUCTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN CREDIT CARD

INCOME. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, CREDIT CARD INCOME

INCREASED IN 2010, REFLECTING HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME ON CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS. FOR A MORE

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CREDIT CARD

INCOME, SEE THE CS AND RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 7981, AND

PAGES 7278, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED IN 2010, LARGELY DUE TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF SECURITIZATION INTERESTS DURING

2009 AND HIGHER AUTO OPERATING LEASE INCOME IN RFS.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009. THE EFFECT OF LOWER LOAN

BALANCES WAS PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RELATED TO VIES (WHICH INCREASED NET INTEREST INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION IN 2010).

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED,

DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, PRIMARILY IN CS, RFS AND IB, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED RUNOFF

OF THE CREDIT CARD BALANCES AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, AND NET REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES;

LOWER YIELDS AND FEES ON CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND

LOWER YIELDS ON SECURITIES IN CORPORATE RESULTING FROM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING. THE

FIRMS AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE $1.7 TRILLION IN 2010, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE

ASSETS, ON A FTE BASIS, WAS 3.06%, A DECREASE OF 6 BASIS POINTS FROM 2009. FOR A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF

THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SEE CS DISCUSSION ON CREDIT CARD

LEGISLATION ON PAGE 79 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $100.4 BILLION, UP BY $33.2 BILLION, OR 49%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE ACROSS MOST FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS, AND THE ABSENCE OF NET MARKDOWNS ON

LEGACY LEVERAGED LENDING AND MORTGAGE POSITIONS IN IB, AS WELL AS HIGHER LEVELS OF TRADING GAINS

AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES INCOME IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. RESULTS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME,

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AND MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME. LASTLY, HIGHER INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO REVENUE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY REDUCED FEES AND COMMISSIONS FROM THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET LEVELS ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND CUSTODY, AND THE ABSENCE OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING

FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE

IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 6971 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF REVENUE FROM TRADING AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. TRADING REVENUE INCREASED,

DRIVEN BY IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ACROSS MOST FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRODUCTS; MODEST NET GAINS ON

LEGACY LEVERAGED LENDING AND MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS, COMPARED WITH NET MARKDOWNS OF $10.6

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND GAINS ON TRADING POSITIONS IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, COMPARED

WITH LOSSES IN THE PRIOR YEAR OF $1.1 BILLION ON MARKDOWNS OF FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION

(FANNIE MAE) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC) PREFERRED SECURITIES.

THESE INCREASES IN REVENUE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN AGGREGATE LOSS OF $2.3 BILLION FROM THE

TIGHTENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES, COMPARED

WITH GAINS OF $2.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM WIDENING SPREADS ON THESE LIABILITIES AND

DERIVATIVES. THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PRODUCED A SLIGHT NET LOSS IN 2009, A

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM A LARGER NET LOSS IN 2008. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE IB AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND ORGANIC GROWTH IN BOTH LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES IN

RFS, CB, IB AND TSS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE

MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB, SEE THE RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 7278, THE TSS SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 8485, AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

8283 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DECLINE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM FROM THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKET LEVELS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER ADMINISTRATION FEES IN TSS, DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF

MARKET DEPRECIATION ON CERTAIN CUSTODY ASSETS AND LOWER SECURITIES LENDING BALANCES; AND LOWER

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS REVENUE IN IB, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO LOWER TRANSACTION VOLUME. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR TSS AND AM ON

PAGES 8485 AND PAGES 8688, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES GAINS WERE LOWER IN 2009 AND INCLUDED CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT AND LOWER GAINS ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES TOTALING $241 MILLION IN 2009, COMPARED

WITH $668 MILLION IN 2008. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER GAINS FROM REPOSITIONING

THE CORPORATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IN CONNECTION WITH MANAGING THE FIRMS STRUCTURAL

INTEREST RATE RISK. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, SEE THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 8990 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS HIGHER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN AVERAGE THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED AS A RESULT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FROM THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY-SOLD LOANS, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

WIDER MARGINS ON NEW ORIGINATIONS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS

RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFS, SEE RFSS MORTGAGE BANKING, AUTO & OTHER CONSUMER LENDING DISCUSSION ON PAGES

7477 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, DECREASED

SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO LOWER SERVICING FEES EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH CS

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CREDIT LOSSES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY WIDER LOAN MARGINS ON SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS; HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE

RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE; AND HIGHER INTERCHANGE

INCOME. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE THE CS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 7981

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE ABSENCE OF $1.5 BILLION IN

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES AS PART OF ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2008; A $1.0 BILLION GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008; AND LOWER NET SECURITIZATION INCOME IN CS. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $464 MILLION CHARGE RECOGNIZED IN 2008 RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES AT PAR; THE ABSENCE OF A $423 MILLION LOSS INCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008,

REFLECTING THE FIRMS 49.4% SHARE OF BEAR STEARNSS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008; AND HIGHER

VALUATIONS ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING SEED CAPITAL IN AM.

NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER AVERAGE LOANS AND DEPOSITS. THE FIRMS INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE

$1.7 TRILLION, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS, WAS

3.12%, AN INCREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS FROM 2008. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME IN 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES, AS WELL AS A WIDER NET INTEREST MARGIN, WHICH REFLECTED THE OVERALL DECLINE IN MARKET

INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR. DECLINING INTEREST RATES HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE NET INTEREST

MARGIN, AS RATES PAID ON THE FIRMS INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED FASTER RELATIVE TO THE

DECLINE IN RATES EARNED ON INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. THESE INCREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER LOAN BALANCES, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND,

REPAYMENTS AND CHARGE-OFFS.

RECOGNIZED IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT RELATED TO THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION IN 2008.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECLINED BY $15.4 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2009, DUE TO DECREASES IN

BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS. THE DECREASES IN THE CONSUMER PROVISIONS REFLECTED

REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR MORTGAGES AND CREDIT CARDS AS A RESULT OF

IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS PORTFOLIO, RESULTING FROM INCREASED ESTIMATED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES. THE DECREASE IN THE

WHOLESALE PROVISION IN 2010 REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PREDOMINANTLY

AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOAN

PORTFOLIO, REDUCED NET CHARGE-OFFS, AND NET REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES. FOR A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS

FOR RFS ON PAGES 7278, CS ON PAGES 7981, IB ON PAGES

6971 AND CB ON PAGES 8283, AND THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SECTION ON PAGES 139141 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2009 ROSE BY $11.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED A

$1.5 BILLION CHARGE TO CONFORM WASHINGTON MUTUALS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH AFFECTED BOTH

THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, THIS CHARGE IS

EXCLUDED. THE CONSUMER PROVISION REFLECTED ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HOME

EQUITY, MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS, AS WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HOUSING PRICE DECLINES

AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THESE PORTFOLIOS.

INCLUDED IN THE 2009 ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS A $1.6 BILLION PROVISION RELATED

TO ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO. THE

WHOLESALE PROVISION INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT IN 2009 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT

NOTE 11 ON PAGE 213 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(D)

EXPENSE FOR 2009 INCLUDED A $675 MILLION FDIC SPECIAL ASSESSMENT.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2010 WAS $61.2 BILLION, UP BY

$8.8 BILLION, OR 17%, FROM 2009. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE, LARGELY

DUE TO HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE, AND THE EFFECT OF INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER SALARY EXPENSE

RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL SALES STAFF IN RFS AND CLIENT

ADVISORS IN AM, AND THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX.

IN ADDITION TO THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE, WHICH WAS LARGELY FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED

MATTERS IN CORPORATE AND IB, THE INCREASE IN NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING

EXPENSE IN CS; HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE, DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT

PLATFORMS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION; HIGHER

DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FORECLOSURE AFFIDAVIT-RELATED SUSPENSIONS

(RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE), FOR THE SERVICED PORTFOLIO IN RFS; AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND

EXCHANGE TRANSACTION PROCESSING EXPENSE IN IB. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WAS THE ABSENCE

OF A $675 MILLION FDIC SPECIAL ASSESSMENT RECOGNIZED IN 2009. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

LITIGATION EXPENSE, SEE THE LITIGATION RESERVE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 32 PAGES 282289 OF THIS ANNUAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $52.4 BILLION, UP BY $8.9 BILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, HIGHER FDIC-RELATED COSTS, AND INCREASED MORTGAGE SERVICING AND

DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE,

INCLUDING SALARY AND BENEFITS BUT EXCLUDING PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, AND OTHER NONCOMPENSATION

COSTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2009 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING

THESE TWO ITEMS, COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT,

PARTICULARLY IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES AND IN CORPORATE.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE FOLLOWING: THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION; HIGHER ONGOING FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND AN FDIC

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF $675 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009; HIGHER MORTGAGE

SERVICING AND DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE, WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSE OF

$1.2 BILLION; HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS; AND THE EFFECT OF THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE,

PARTICULARLY IN IB, TSS AND AM; A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS; LOWER MORTGAGE REINSURANCE LOSSES; AND A DECREASE IN CREDIT

CARD MARKETING EXPENSE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, REFER TO NOTE 17 ON PAGES

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX BOOK INCOME, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO U.S.

FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE

REINVESTED INDEFINITELY, AS WELL AS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED UPON THE RESOLUTION OF TAX AUDITS IN

2010. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE

FIRM ON PAGES 149154 AND NOTE 27 ON PAGES 271273 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME AND CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. BENEFITS RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT INCOME, BUSINESS TAX CREDITS AND TAX AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS INCREASED IN 2009 RELATIVE TO 2008; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON THE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME IN 2009. IN ADDITION, 2008

REFLECTED THE REALIZATION OF BENEFITS OF $1.1 BILLION FROM THE RELEASE OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE

REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL. THIS

TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

THE ADJUSTED NET ASSET VALUE OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS AFTER PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS WAS

HIGHER THAN THE CONSIDERATION PAID BY JPMORGAN CHASE, RESULTING IN AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. THE

PRELIMINARY GAIN RECOGNIZED IN 2008 WAS $1.9 BILLION. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM

RECOGNIZED AN ADDITIONAL $76 MILLION EXTRAORDINARY GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINAL PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 166170 OF THE FIRMS 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES 160163

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED BASIS, PROVIDES THE

READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO

YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS

RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP

RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FIRM (AND EACH

OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS) ON A FTE BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS IS PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO

TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE

COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME

TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE NO

IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE OR BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRMS MANAGED-BASIS PRESENTATION ALSO INCLUDED CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT ASSUMED CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY CS REMAINED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRED THE

FIRM TO CONSOLIDATE ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. THE INCOME, EXPENSE AND

CREDIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE NOW RECORDED IN THE 2010

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY USED TO REPORT

SUCH ITEMS ON A MANAGED BASIS. AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS, REPORTED AND MANAGED BASIS RELATING TO CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ARE EQUIVALENT FOR

PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, SEE

NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE PRESENTATION IN 2009 AND 2008 OF CS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS ASSUMED THAT CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SECURITIZED AND SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP REMAINED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHEETS, AND THAT THE EARNINGS ON THE SECURITIZED LOANS WERE CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME MANNER AS

THE EARNINGS ON RETAINED LOANS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAD USED

THIS MANAGED-BASIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. OPERATIONS WERE FUNDED AND DECISIONS WERE MADE ABOUT

ALLOCATING RESOURCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED ON MANAGED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IN

ADDITION, THE SAME UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING RISK MONITORING ARE USED FOR BOTH LOANS ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND SECURITIZED LOANS. ALTHOUGH SECURITIZATIONS RESULT IN THE SALE

OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS THE ONGOING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS,

AS THE CUSTOMERS MAY CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS; ACCORDINGLY, THE CUSTOMERS CREDIT

PERFORMANCE AFFECTS BOTH THE SECURITIZED LOANS AND THE LOANS RETAINED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS, AND LOANS

AND RESIDUAL INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (TCE) REPRESENTS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (I.E., TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK) LESS IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN MORTGAGE SERVICING

RIGHTS (MSRS)) AND GOODWILL, NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ROTCE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

RATIO, MEASURES THE FIRMS EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TCE AND IS, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, A

MEANINGFUL MEASURE TO ASSESS THE FIRMS USE OF EQUITY.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT

BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE

UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND, THEREFORE,

FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS. NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE FIRM MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING,

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF

CUSTOMER SERVED, AND REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY

MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A

STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING

METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS,

METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS

MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS

REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND

TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO THE TREASURY GROUP WITHIN THE

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT

SEGMENTS STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REVIEWED BY THE

FIRMS ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO). BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY BE PERMITTED TO RETAIN CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER

COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ENHANCED

ITS LINE-OF-BUSINESS EQUITY FRAMEWORK TO BETTER ALIGN EQUITY ASSIGNED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AS A

RESULT OF THE CHANGES ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR IN THE BUSINESS, AND IN THE COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY

LANDSCAPE. THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE NOW CAPITALIZED BASED ON THE TIER 1 COMMON STANDARD, RATHER

THAN THE TIER 1 CAPITAL STANDARD. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGES, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

 LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGE 105 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE

SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THEIR

ACTUAL COST OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR MARKET, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED.

IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY

AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED

EXPENSE INCLUDES: PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE

BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS

WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH A PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

EXPENSE WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 17% ON $40.0 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

NET INCOME WAS $6.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $1.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE

RESULTS REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST

EXPENSE AND A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $28.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $12.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES WERE UP 21% TO $7.2 BILLION, CONSISTING OF DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.7 BILLION (UP

24%), EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.6 BILLION (UP 51%), AND ADVISORY FEES OF $1.9 BILLION (DOWN

7%). FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE WAS $17.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ACROSS MOST PRODUCTS AND MODEST NET GAINS ON LEGACY LEVERAGED

LENDING AND MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS, COMPARED WITH NET MARKDOWNS OF $10.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $4.4 BILLION, UP 22% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY STRONG CLIENT

REVENUE ACROSS PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY PRIME SERVICES, AND IMPROVED

TRADING RESULTS. FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED

LOSSES OF $1.7 BILLION FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRMS

CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES, COMPARED WITH GAINS

OF $1.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CREDIT PORTFOLIO

REVENUE WAS A LOSS OF $1.0 BILLION VERSUS A GAIN OF $860 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON HEDGES OF RETAINED LOANS COMPARED WITH GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE NET IMPACT OF CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO

END-OF-PERIOD LOANS RETAINED WAS 8.25%, COMPARED WITH 4.83% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE

$1.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $105 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS WERE $4.2

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $15.4 BILLION, UP $1.6 BILLION, OR 11%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 21% ON $33.0 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL, COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE 5%

ON $26.1 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TO ASSESS A COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. IB BELIEVES AN ADJUSTED ASSET AMOUNT THAT EXCLUDES THE

ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WHICH WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A LOW RISK PROFILE, PROVIDES A MORE

MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF BALANCE SHEET LEVERAGE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY.

RFS USES THE OVERHEAD RATIO (EXCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES

(CDI)), A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING EXPENSE TRENDS OF THE

BUSINESS. INCLUDING CDI AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE OVERHEAD RATIO CALCULATION WOULD RESULT IN

A HIGHER OVERHEAD RATIO IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND A LOWER OVERHEAD RATIO IN LATER YEARS. THIS

METHOD WOULD THEREFORE RESULT IN AN IMPROVING OVERHEAD RATIO OVER TIME, ALL THINGS REMAINING

EQUAL. THE NON-GAAP RATIO EXCLUDES RETAIL BANKINGS CDI AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO PRIOR

BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS OF $276 MILLION, $328 MILLION AND $394 MILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

NET INCOME WAS $2.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $97 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE WAS $31.8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $936 MILLION, OR 3%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $19.5 BILLION, DOWN BY $964 MILLION, OR 5%, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER LOAN

AND DEPOSIT BALANCES AND NARROWER LOAN SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT TO WIDER-SPREAD DEPOSIT

PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $12.2 BILLION, FLAT TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED

FEES WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEBIT CARD INCOME AND AUTO OPERATING LEASE INCOME.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $9.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $15.9 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED AN ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $3.4 BILLION

FOR THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) PORTFOLIO AND A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES OF $1.8 BILLION, PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. IN COMPARISON, THE

PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED AN ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES OF $5.8 BILLION, PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS, BUT WHICH ALSO

INCLUDED AN ADDITION OF $1.6 BILLION FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO. WHILE DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND NET

CHARGE-OFFS IMPROVED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, THE PROVISION CONTINUED TO REFLECT ELEVATED

LOSSES FOR THE MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIOS. SEE PAGE 130 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE NET

CHARGE-OFF AMOUNTS AND RATES. TO DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON PCI LOANS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $17.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.1 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING HIGHER DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RFSS FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTS THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS

RETAIL BANK NETWORK AND MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008. SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 166170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE

INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS TRANSACTION.

NET INCOME WAS $97 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $783 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS THE INCREASE IN

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES MORE THAN OFFSET THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION.

NET REVENUE WAS $32.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $9.2 BILLION, OR 39%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $20.5 BILLION, UP BY $6.3 BILLION, OR 45%, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, AND WIDER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $12.2

BILLION, UP BY $2.8 BILLION, OR 30%, DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

WIDER MARGINS ON MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND HIGHER NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY $1.6 BILLION IN ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $15.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $6.0 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND HOUSING PRICE DECLINES CONTINUED TO DRIVE HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR

THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE PROVISION INCLUDED AN ADDITION OF $5.8 BILLION TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, COMPARED WITH AN ADDITION OF $5.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

INCLUDED IN THE 2009 ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS A $1.6 BILLION INCREASE RELATED

TO ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PCI PORTFOLIO.

SEE PAGE 130 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF AMOUNTS AND RATES. TO DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON PCI

LOANS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $16.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $4.7 BILLION, OR 39%. THE INCREASE REFLECTED

THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER SERVICING AND DEFAULT-RELATED

EXPENSE.

REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $2.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $5.4

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME.

NET REVENUE WAS $5.5 BILLION, DOWN BY $973 MILLION, OR 15%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS

DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER LOAN BALANCES, REFLECTING NET

PORTFOLIO RUNOFF.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $8.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $13.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $1.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A

$1.6 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THIS REDUCTION IN THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF $632 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE ESTIMATED

NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING DELINQUENT

RESIDENTIAL HOME LOANS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO

PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS ON PAGE 131 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE REMAINING REDUCTION OF THE ALLOWANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION WAS A RESULT

OF AN IMPROVEMENT IN DELINQUENCIES AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES, COMPARED WITH PRIOR YEAR ADDITIONS

OF $3.6 BILLION FOR THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT-YEAR

PROVISION REFLECTED AN ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $3.4 BILLION FOR THE PCI

PORTFOLIO,

COMPARED WITH A PRIOR YEAR ADDITION OF $1.6 BILLION FOR THIS PORTFOLIO. (FOR FURTHER

DETAIL, SEE THE RFS DISCUSSION OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

PAGE 72 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.)

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.6 BILLION, DOWN BY $220 MILLION, OR 12%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

LOWER DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $5.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $3.4

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE WAS $6.5 BILLION, UP BY $2.6 BILLION, OR 65%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS

DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND WIDER LOAN SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER HERITAGE CHASE LOAN BALANCES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $13.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $8.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE PROVISION REFLECTED WEAKNESS IN THE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. (FOR FURTHER DETAIL,

SEE THE RFS DISCUSSION OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR FURTHER

DETAIL) ON PAGES 7273 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.8 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $889 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

HIGHER DEFAULT-RELATED EXPENSE.

INCLUDED WITHIN REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS ARE PCI LOANS THAT THE FIRM ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION. FOR PCI LOANS, THE EXCESS OF THE UNDISCOUNTED GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOANS (THE ACCRETABLE YIELD) IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST

INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE LOANS.

THE NET SPREAD BETWEEN THE PCI LOANS AND THE RELATED LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER

TIME, EXCEPT FOR ANY BASIS RISK OR OTHER RESIDUAL INTEREST RATE RISK THAT REMAINS AND FOR CERTAIN

CHANGES IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE (E.G. FROM EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS AND FROM

PREPAYMENTS). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF THE PCI LOAN

PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO BE 7.0 YEARS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 14, PCI LOANS, ON PAGES

233236 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE LOAN BALANCES ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE MORE RAPIDLY IN THE

EARLIER YEARS AS THE MOST TROUBLED LOANS ARE LIQUIDATED, AND MORE SLOWLY THEREAFTER AS THE

REMAINING TROUBLED BORROWERS HAVE LIMITED REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. SIMILARLY, DEFAULT AND

SERVICING EXPENSE ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND DECLINE OVER TIME AS

LIQUIDATIONS SLOW DOWN.

TO DATE THE IMPACT OF THE PCI LOANS ON REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS NET INCOME HAS BEEN MODESTLY

NEGATIVE. THIS IS DUE TO THE CURRENT NET SPREAD OF THE PORTFOLIO, THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

RECOGNIZED SUBSEQUENT TO ITS ACQUISITION, AND THE HIGHER LEVEL OF DEFAULT AND SERVICING EXPENSE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PORTFOLIO. OVER TIME, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THIS PORTFOLIO WILL CONTRIBUTE

POSITIVELY TO NET INCOME.

OF THE PORTFOLIO. AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $4.9 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION WAS RECORDED

FOR THESE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN EXCLUDED

SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS, THE PAST-DUE

STATUS OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF THE INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT MEANINGFUL.

BECAUSE THE FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE ALL

CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING.

NA: NOT APPLICABLE

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

NET INCOME WAS $2.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $2.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

IMPROVED RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET

REVENUE.

END-OF-PERIOD LOANS WERE $137.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $25.7 BILLION, OR 16%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

AVERAGE LOANS WERE $144.4 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $28.0 BILLION, OR 16%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

DECLINES IN BOTH END-OF-PERIOD AND AVERAGE LOANS WERE DUE TO A DECLINE IN LOWER-YIELDING

PROMOTIONAL BALANCES AND THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO RUNOFF.

NET REVENUE WAS $17.2 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $3.1 BILLION, OR 15%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.9 BILLION, DOWN BY $3.5 BILLION, OR 20%. THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST

INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AND A

DECREASED LEVEL OF FEES. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS

ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $3.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $357

MILLION, OR 12%, DRIVEN BY THE PRIOR-YEAR WRITE-DOWN OF SECURITIZATION INTERESTS, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

LOWER REVENUE FROM FEE-BASED PRODUCTS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $8.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $18.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A REDUCTION OF $6.0 BILLION TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED AN

ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. INCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

PORTFOLIO, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 9.72%, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, UP FROM 9.33% IN THE

PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 4.07%, DOWN FROM 6.28% IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 8.72%, INCLUDING LOANS

HELD-FOR-SALE, UP FROM 8.45% IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 3.66%, DOWN

FROM 5.52% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $416 MILLION, OR 8%, DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING

EXPENSE.

CREDIT CARD LEGISLATION

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT WAS ENACTED. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL REDUCTION IN NET INCOME

RESULTING FROM THE CARD ACT IS APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION ANNUALLY. THE RUN-RATE IMPACT OF THIS

REDUCTION IN NET INCOME IS REFLECTED IN RESULTS AS OF THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. THE

FULL YEAR IMPACT ON 2010 NET INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF THE CARD ACT INCLUDE: (A) THE INABILITY TO CHANGE THE PRICING OF

EXISTING BALANCES; (B) THE ALLOCATION OF CUSTOMER PAYMENTS ABOVE THE MINIMUM PAYMENT TO THE

EXISTING BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR); (C) THE REQUIREMENT THAT

CUSTOMERS OPT-IN IN ORDER TO RECEIVE, FOR A FEE, OVERLIMIT PROTECTION THAT PERMITS AN AUTHORIZED

TRANSACTION OVER THEIR CREDIT LIMIT; (D) THE REQUIREMENT THAT STATEMENTS MUST BE MAILED OR

DELIVERED NOT LATER THAN 21 DAYS BEFORE THE PAYMENT DUE DATE; (E) THE LIMITING OF THE AMOUNT OF

PENALTY FEES THAT CAN BE ASSESSED; AND (F) THE REQUIREMENT TO REVIEW CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS FOR

POTENTIAL INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

AS A RESULT OF THE CARD ACT, CS HAS IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES TO MANAGE

ITS INABILITY TO PRICE LOANS TO CUSTOMERS AT RATES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR RISK OVER TIME.

THESE CHANGES INCLUDE: (A) SELECTIVELY INCREASING PRICING; (B) REDUCING THE VOLUME AND DURATION OF

LOW-RATE PROMOTIONAL PRICING OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS; AND (C) REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT IS

GRANTED TO CERTAIN NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF CSS FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTS THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS

CREDIT CARDS OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, AND

THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2008. SEE NOTE 2 ON

PAGES 166170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE TRANSACTIONS.

CARD SERVICES REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $2.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $780 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER TOTAL NET REVENUE.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE $163.4 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $26.9 BILLION, OR 14%, FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER CHARGE VOLUME AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS. AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS

WERE $172.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $9.5 BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, END-OF-PERIOD AND AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS FOR 2009 WERE $143.8 BILLION AND $148.8

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $20.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $3.8 BILLION, OR 23%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $17.4 BILLION, UP BY $3.6 BILLION, OR 26%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

DRIVEN BY WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THESE BENEFITS

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS, A DECREASED

LEVEL OF FEES, LOWER AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $201 MILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A LARGER WRITE-DOWN OF SECURITIZATION INTERESTS.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $18.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $8.4 BILLION FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND AN ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 9.33%, UP FROM 5.01% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS

6.28%, UP FROM 4.97% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 8.45%, AND THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 5.52%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $241 MILLION, OR 5%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE

TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

RECORD NET INCOME WAS $2.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $813 MILLION, OR 64%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER NET REVENUE.

NET REVENUE WAS A RECORD $6.0 BILLION, UP BY $320 MILLION, OR 6%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $3.8 BILLION, DOWN BY $63 MILLION, OR 2%, DRIVEN BY SPREAD COMPRESSION ON

LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND LOWER LOAN BALANCES, PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN LIABILITY BALANCES

AND WIDER LOAN SPREADS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $383 MILLION, OR 21%,

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER NET GAINS FROM ASSET SALES, HIGHER LENDING-RELATED FEES, AN

IMPROVEMENT IN THE MARKET CONDITIONS IMPACTING THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE, HIGHER

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND INCREASED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT-RELATED REVENUE.

BALANCES. REAL ESTATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $460 MILLION, FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

82

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $297 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

DECLINE WAS MAINLY DUE TO STABILIZATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND REFINEMENTS

WITH $1.1 BILLION (1.02% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO

PERIOD-END LOANS RETAINED WAS 2.61%, DOWN FROM 3.12% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE $2.0

BILLION, A DECREASE OF $801 MILLION, OR 29%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $23 MILLION, OR 1%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR REFLECTING HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSE.

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

NET INCOME WAS $1.3 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $168 MILLION, OR 12%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS HIGHER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE,

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

RECORD NET REVENUE OF $5.7 BILLION INCREASED $943 MILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME OF $3.9 BILLION INCREASED $607 MILLION, OR 18%, DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $336 MILLION,

OR 23%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND HIGHER

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND OTHER INCOME.

ON A CLIENT SEGMENT BASIS, REVENUE FROM MIDDLE MARKET BANKING WAS $3.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $116

MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES, A SHIFT TO HIGHER-SPREAD

LIABILITY PRODUCTS, WIDER LOAN SPREADS, HIGHER LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AND HIGHER OTHER

INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NARROWING OF SPREADS ON LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND REDUCED LOAN BALANCES.

12%, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

PREDOMINANTLY IN REAL ESTATE-RELATED SEGMENTS. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $1.1 BILLION (1.02% NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE), COMPARED WITH $288 MILLION (0.35% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO END-OF-PERIOD LOANS RETAINED WAS 3.12%, UP FROM 2.45% IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE $2.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAD A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE

OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION

EXPENSE WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS

RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON

MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE

16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2010 COMPARED WITH 2009

NET INCOME WAS $1.3 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN

BY HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE.

NET INCOME FOR PRIVATE EQUITY WAS $588 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $78 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN THE

PORTFOLIO. NET REVENUE WAS $1.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $18 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS OF $1.3 BILLION COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $54 MILLION. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS

$323 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $182 MILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

NET INCOME FOR CORPORATE WAS $670 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CURRENT

YEAR RESULTS REFLECT AFTER-TAX LITIGATION EXPENSE OF $3.5 BILLION, LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME AND

TRADING GAINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITIES GAINS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND TO

REBALANCE EXPOSURE. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED MERGER-RELATED NET LOSS OF $635 MILLION AND A $419

MILLION FDIC ASSESSMENT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2009 COMPARED WITH 2008

NET INCOME WAS $3.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH $557 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LITIGATION

EXPENSE.

NET LOSS FOR PRIVATE EQUITY WAS $78 MILLION COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF $690 MILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET REVENUE WAS $18 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $981 MILLION, REFLECTING PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES OF

$54 MILLION COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $894 MILLION. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $141 MILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $21 MILLION.

NET INCOME FOR CORPORATE, INCLUDING MERGER-RELATED ITEMS, WAS $3.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.2

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS IN 2009 REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF TRADING GAINS, NET INTEREST

INCOME AND AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $150 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY $635 MILLION MERGER-RELATED LOSSES, A $419 MILLION FDIC SPECIAL ASSESSMENT, LOWER SECURITIES

GAINS AND THE ABSENCE OF THE $1.9 BILLION EXTRAORDINARY GAIN RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

MERGER IN 2008. TRADING GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICES

(CIO) SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS WERE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK

AND INVESTMENT OF CASH RESULTING FROM THE EXCESS FUNDING THE FIRM CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE DURING

2009. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF HIGHER-COUPON INSTRUMENTS (PART

OF REPOSITIONING THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO) AS WELL AS PREPAYMENTS AND MATURITIES.

AFTER-TAX RESULTS IN 2008 INCLUDED $955 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND $627 MILLION FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF

THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT

VENTURE. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES OF $642 MILLION ON PREFERRED SECURITIES OF

FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, A $248 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE OFFER TO REPURCHASE AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES AND $211 MILLION NET MERGER COSTS.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OVERVIEW

TOTAL ASSETS WERE $2.1 TRILLION, UP BY $85.6 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY A RESULT OF HIGHER TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

IMPROVED MARKET ACTIVITY; HIGHER LOANS, LARGELY DUE TO THE JANUARY 1, 2010, ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES; AND HIGHER FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER FINANCING VOLUME IN IB. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, AS MARKET STRESS EASED FROM THE END OF 2009.

TOTAL LIABILITIES WERE $1.9 TRILLION, UP BY $74.9 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY A RESULT

OF HIGHER BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS $176.1 BILLION, UP BY $10.7 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PREDOMINANTLY

BY NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AS A

RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES.

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE SPECIFIC LINE CAPTIONS OF THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009.

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS; FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; AND

SECURITIES BORROWED

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES; TO MANAGE ITS CASH

POSITIONS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; AND TO SUPPORT ITS TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED ARE

USED TO PROVIDE FUNDING OR LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS BY PURCHASING AND BORROWING THEIR SECURITIES FOR

THE SHORT TERM. THE DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER DEPOSITS WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND LOWER INTERBANK LENDING, AS MARKET STRESS EASED FROM THE END OF 2009.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS INCREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER FINANCING

VOLUME IN IB. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES

110115 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY. THESE

INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE

DEBT; EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES; LOANS, INCLUDING PRIME MORTGAGE AND

OTHER LOANS WAREHOUSED BY RFS AND IB FOR SALE OR SECURITIZATION PURPOSES AND ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE; AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. TRADING

ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS INCREASED, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO IMPROVED MARKET ACTIVITY,

PRIMARILY IN EQUITY SECURITIES, FOREIGN DEBT AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES. TRADING LIABILITIES  DEBT

AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS INCREASED, LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF POSITIONS TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER

TRADING. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY. DERIVATIVES ENABLE

CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND

OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE. DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES WERE FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. DERIVATIVE PAYABLES INCREASED, REFLECTING

TIGHTER CREDIT SPREADS, APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AND HIGHER COMMODITY DERIVATIVES BALANCES

(DRIVEN BY INCREASING COMMODITY PRICES AND THE RBS SEMPRA

ACQUISITION). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ON PAGES 125128, AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 3 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES

170187 AND 191199, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) AND USED

PRIMARILY TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND TO INVEST CASH RESULTING

FROM EXCESS FUNDING POSITIONS. SECURITIES DECREASED, LARGELY DUE TO REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO

IN CORPORATE, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND TO REBALANCE EXPOSURES.

THE REPOSITIONING REDUCED U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND INCREASED NON-U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES, WHICH RESULTED IN THE

ELIMINATION OF RETAINED AFS SECURITIES ISSUED BY FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS,

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE. FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT ON PAGES 8990, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES 170187 AND

214218, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS

TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE

FIRMS ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES AT JANUARY 1, 2010. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, LOANS DECREASED DUE TO THE CONTINUED RUNOFF OF THE

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AND CREDIT CARD BALANCES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE IN WHOLESALE LOANS, MAINLY IN TSS AND AM.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THIS ADOPTION, DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A

DECLINE IN THE CREDIT CARD AND WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE. THE DECREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN

INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) ALLOWANCE.

FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 116141, AND NOTES 3, 4, 14 AND 15 ON PAGES 170187, 187189,

220238 AND 239243, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THIS LINE CAPTION CONSISTS OF ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLES FROM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS;

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS (PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS);

RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS; AND RECEIVABLES FROM FAILED

SECURITIES SALES. ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED, REFLECTING HIGHER CUSTOMER

RECEIVABLES IN IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS DUE TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE WAS

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE ELIMINATION OF RETAINED SECURITIZATION INTERESTS UPON THE ADOPTION OF THE

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE ADOPTION, SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 164165 AND 244259, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

THE FIRMS PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT CONSIST OF LAND, BUILDINGS, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, FURNITURE AND

FIXTURES, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. THE INCREASE IN PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF TWO BUILDINGS, ONE IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN LONDON; INVESTMENTS IN

HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF THESE ASSETS.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ARISES FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN

ACQUIRED ENTITY OR BUSINESS OVER THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED. THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF RBS SEMPRA COMMODITIES

GLOBAL OIL, GLOBAL METAL, AND EUROPEAN POWER AND GAS BUSINESSES BY IB; AND THE PURCHASE OF A

MAJORITY INTEREST IN GÁVEA INVESTIMENTOS, A LEADING ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN BRAZIL,

BY AM. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MSRS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SPECIFIED MORTGAGE-SERVICING

ACTIVITIES (PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES) FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED

FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX

AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE RELATED

INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. MSRS DECREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT

DECLINE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES DURING 2010, AS WELL AS FROM SERVICING PORTFOLIO RUNOFF AND

DISPOSITIONS OF MSRS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES RELATED TO SALES IN RFS OF

ORIGINATED LOANS FOR WHICH SERVICING RIGHTS WERE RETAINED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS, SEE

NOTE 3 AND NOTE 17 ON PAGES 170187 AND 260263, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, OTHER CREDIT CARDRELATED

INTANGIBLES, CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. THE DECREASE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WAS PREDOMINATELY DUE TO AMORTIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE RESULTING FROM THE

AFOREMENTIONED GÁVEA INVESTIMENTOS TRANSACTION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER ASSETS

OTHER ASSETS CONSIST OF PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, CASH COLLATERAL PLEDGED, CORPORATE

AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS (INCLUDING REAL

ESTATE OWNED) AND ALL OTHER ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OTHER ASSETS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT

COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DEPOSITS

DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS, BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE, RELATED TO NON-BROKERAGE

FUNDS HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS ARE CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION (U.S. AND NON-U.S.), WHETHER THEY

ARE INTEREST- OR NONINTEREST-BEARING, AND BY TYPE (I.E., DEMAND, MONEY-MARKET, SAVINGS, TIME OR

NEGOTIABLE ORDER OF WITHDRAWAL ACCOUNTS). DEPOSITS PROVIDE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

FUNDING FOR THE FIRM. DEPOSITS DECREASED, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN WHOLESALE FUNDING DUE TO THE

FIRMS LOWER FUNDING NEEDS, AND LOWER DEPOSIT LEVELS IN TSS.

THESE FACTORS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

NET INFLOWS FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS IN CB, RFS AND AM. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE RFS AND AM SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES

7278 AND 8688, RESPECTIVELY; THE

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 110115; AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 19 ON PAGES 170187

AND 263264, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON WHOLESALE LIABILITY

BALANCES, WHICH INCLUDES DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 8283 AND

8485, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND TO SUPPORT ITS

TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES

LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE USED AS SHORT-TERM FUNDING SOURCES AND TO MAKE

SECURITIES AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS INCREASED, LARGELY DUE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN IB, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CIO REPOSITIONING ACTIVITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES 110115 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM USES COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS IN ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO

MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, AND IN CONNECTION WITH A TSS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, WHEREBY

EXCESS CLIENT FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS. COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, WHICH INCLUDES ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (FHLBS),

DECREASED DUE TO LOWER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, SEE PAGES 110115, AND NOTE 20 ON PAGE 264 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES CONSIST OF PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS (PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVITIES

RELATED TO IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS); PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS;

PAYABLES FROM FAILED SECURITIES PURCHASES; ACCRUED EXPENSE, INCLUDING INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES;

AND ALL OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES AND OBLIGATIONS TO RETURN SECURITIES

RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCREASED DUE TO ADDITIONAL

LITIGATION RESERVES, LARGELY FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES REPRESENT INTEREST-BEARING BENEFICIAL-INTEREST

LIABILITIES, WHICH INCREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RELATED TO VIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF $24.9 BILLION RELATED TO FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FIRM-SPONSORED VIES AND LOAN

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, SEE OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS BELOW,

AND NOTE 16 AND NOTE 22 ON PAGES 244259 AND 265266, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

THE FIRM USES LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST-PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) TO PROVIDE

COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDS AND AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED, DUE TO LOWER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

MATURITIES AND REDEMPTIONS TOTALED $53.4 BILLION DURING 2010 AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW

ISSUANCES OF $36.0 BILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE

THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 110115, AND NOTE 22 ON PAGES 265266 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET INCOME, AND NET ISSUANCES AND

COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE INCREASE WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES,

WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $4.5 BILLION, DRIVEN BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES OF $7.5 BILLION (PRETAX) RELATED TO RECEIVABLES PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED AT THE ADOPTION DATE. ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE

INCREASE WERE STOCK REPURCHASES; THE PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY FROM NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS; AND THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND

PREFERRED STOCK. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE ADOPTION OF NEW CONSOLIDATED GUIDANCE

RELATED TO VIES, SEE NOTES 1 AND 16 ON PAGES 164165 AND 244259, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS

INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGH UNCONSOLIDATED

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), WHICH ARE A TYPE OF VIE, AND THROUGH LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

SPES ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE, USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS TO ISOLATE

CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE RELATED CASH FLOWS TO INVESTORS. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY

SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO

INVESTORS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, SHORT-TERM ASSET-BACKED NOTES, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND

OTHER FORMS OF INTEREST. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE

SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

AS A RESULT OF NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, CERTAIN VIES WERE CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. NEVERTHELESS, SPES CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AS THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MARKETS FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING

FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SPES

THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. SEE

NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE TYPES OF SPES.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED

EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES

PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH

THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS,

PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS, TO BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND NONCONSOLIDATED SPES,

WERE $34.2 BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.,

WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF

PROVIDING

FUNDING UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE

SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES REVENUE

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN REVENUE INFORMATION RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED AND

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT. THE REVENUE REPORTED IN THE

TABLE BELOW PRIMARILY REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL SERVICING AND CREDIT FEE INCOME (I.E., FEE INCOME FROM

ACTING AS ADMINISTRATOR, STRUCTURER OR LIQUIDITY PROVIDER). IT DOES NOT INCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES

FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING POSITIONS (SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS) ENTERED INTO

WITH VIES. THOSE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

THE U.S. TREASURYS MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (MHA) PROGRAMS AND THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS MITIGATION

PROGRAMS. SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES 129138 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE DETAILS ON

THESE LOAN MODIFICATIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO

MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE FIRMS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT

OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE

GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY

SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL

AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT

EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ON PAGE 128 AND NOTE

30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE PRESENTS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE AMOUNTS BY CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF

OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER GUARANTEES. THE AMOUNTS IN THE

TABLE FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL

AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WOULD BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRM CAN

REDUCE OR CANCEL CREDIT CARD LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME

CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE FIRM MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT

WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN

A

DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE EXCLUDES

CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT DO NOT HAVE A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE (E.G., LOAN SALE AND

SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS). FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE DISCUSSION OF LOAN SALE AND

SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN NOTE 30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS ANNUAL

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH FANNIE MAE AND

STANDARDS, VALIDITY OF CERTAIN BORROWER REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN, PRIMARY

MORTGAGE INSURANCE BEING IN

FORCE FOR ANY MORTGAGE LOAN WITH A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO (LTV) GREATER THAN 80%, AND THE USE OF THE

GSES STANDARD LEGAL DOCUMENTATION. THE FIRM MAY BE, AND HAS BEEN, REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS

AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE GSES AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; HOWEVER, PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS RECEIVED BY

THE FIRM AND THE FIRMS LOSSES REALIZED TO DATE ARE RELATED TO LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES.

TO DATE, THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED FROM THE GSES PRIMARILY RELATE TO LOANS

ORIGINATED FROM 2005 TO 2008. DEMANDS AGAINST THE PRE-2005 AND POST-2008 VINTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN

SIGNIFICANT; THE FIRM ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THE COMPARATIVELY FAVORABLE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THESE

VINTAGES AND TO THE ENHANCED UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED

PROGRESSIVELY DURING 2007 AND 2008. FROM 2005 TO 2008, EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, LOANS SOLD TO

THE GSES SUBJECT TO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM MAY BE LIABLE WERE

APPROXIMATELY $380 BILLION; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF LOANS SOLD THROUGHOUT

2005 TO 2008 AND HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY, SUCH AS BORROWER REPAYMENTS OF

PRINCIPAL OR REPURCHASES COMPLETED TO DATE. SEE THE DISCUSSION BELOW FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

PROCESS THE FIRM USES TO EVALUATE REPURCHASE DEMANDS FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES, AND THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES RELATED TO SUCH EXPOSURE.

FROM 2005 TO 2008, WASHINGTON MUTUAL SOLD APPROXIMATELY $150 BILLION OF LOANS TO THE GSES SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRMS ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE FDIC IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED AND/OR

LIMITED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS FOR LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES BY WASHINGTON

MUTUAL, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE FIRMS POSITION THAT SUCH OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC

RECEIVERSHIP. NEVERTHELESS, CERTAIN PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF THE THEN

CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS, AND THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND MAY PAY CERTAIN

FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL LOANS. IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENTS ALREADY MADE,

THE FIRM ESTIMATES IT HAS A REMAINING REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, RELATING TO UNRESOLVED AND FUTURE DEMANDS ON LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES BY

WASHINGTON MUTUAL. AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THIS REPURCHASE LIABILITY, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE

REMAINING GSE REPURCHASE EXPOSURE RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL PRESENTS MINIMAL FUTURE RISK TO THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE FIRM ALSO SELLS LOANS IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE; THESE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY

INSURED BY THE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION (FHA) OR THE RURAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION (RHA)

AND/OR GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA). THE FIRM, IN ITS ROLE AS

SERVICER, MAY ELECT TO REPURCHASE DELINQUENT LOANS SECURITIZED BY GINNIE MAE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY GINNIE MAE, FHA, RHA AND VA. AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE LOANS

CONTINUE TO BE INSURED AND THE REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED AMOUNTS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT RECORDED ANY REPURCHASE LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE LOANS.

FROM 2005 TO 2008, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED ENTITIES SOLD OR DEPOSITED APPROXIMATELY $450

BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TO SECURITIZATION TRUSTS IN PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS THEY SPONSORED. IN CONNECTION THEREWITH CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WERE MADE RELATED TO THESE LOANS. WITH RESPECT TO THE $165 BILLION OF PRIVATE-LABEL

SECURITIZATIONS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, IT IS THE FIRMS POSITION THAT REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH

THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP.

WHILE THE

TERMS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS VARY, THEY GENERALLY DIFFER FROM LOAN SALES TO

GSES IN THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) IN ORDER TO DIRECT THE TRUSTEE TO INVESTIGATE LOAN FILES, THE

SECURITY HOLDERS MUST MAKE A FORMAL REQUEST FOR THE TRUSTEE TO DO SO, AND TYPICALLY, THIS REQUIRES

AGREEMENT OF THE HOLDERS OF A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES; (II) GENERALLY,

THE MORTGAGE LOANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET ALL GSE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; AND (III) IN MANY CASES,

THE PARTY DEMANDING REPURCHASE IS REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOAN-LEVEL BREACH OF A

REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HAS MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE VALUE OF THE LOAN. OF THE $450

BILLION ORIGINALLY SOLD OR DEPOSITED (INCLUDING $165 BILLION BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AS TO WHICH THE FIRM MAINTAINS THE REPURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP), APPROXIMATELY $180 BILLION OF PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN REPAID.

APPROXIMATELY $80 BILLION OF LOANS HAVE BEEN LIQUIDATED, WITH AN AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITY OF 57%. THE

REMAINING OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THESE LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$190 BILLION.

TO DATE, LOAN-LEVEL REPURCHASE DEMANDS IN PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS HAVE BEEN

LIMITED. AS A RESULT, THE FIRMS REPURCHASE RESERVE PRIMARILY RELATES TO LOAN SALES TO THE GSES AND

IS PREDOMINANTLY DERIVED FROM REPURCHASE ACTIVITY WITH THE GSES. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

VOLUME OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS IN PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THE FIRM

CANNOT OFFER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THOSE FUTURE DEMANDS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE TO DATE.

THUS FAR, CLAIMS RELATED TO PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS (INCLUDING FROM INSURERS THAT HAVE GUARANTEED

CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS) HAVE GENERALLY MANIFESTED THEMSELVES THROUGH

SECURITIES-RELATED LITIGATION. THE FIRM SEPARATELY EVALUATES ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH LITIGATION IN

ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 32

ON PAGES 282289 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPURCHASE

DEMAND PROCESS

THE FIRM FIRST BECOMES AWARE THAT A GSE IS EVALUATING A PARTICULAR LOAN FOR REPURCHASE WHEN THE

FIRM RECEIVES A REQUEST FROM THE GSE TO REVIEW THE UNDERLYING LOAN FILE (FILE REQUEST). UPON

COMPLETING ITS REVIEW, THE GSE MAY SUBMIT A REPURCHASE DEMAND TO THE FIRM; HISTORICALLY, MOST FILE

REQUESTS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN REPURCHASE DEMANDS.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES RELATE TO ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS

PRIMARILY ARISING FROM: (I) CREDIT QUALITY AND/OR UNDISCLOSED DEBT OF THE BORROWER; (II) INCOME

LEVEL AND/OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THE BORROWER; AND (III) APPRAISED VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

INELIGIBILITY OF THE BORROWER FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT, MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS AND

MISSING DOCUMENTATION ARE OTHER REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS. BEGINNING IN 2009, MORTGAGE

INSURERS MORE FREQUENTLY RESCINDED MORTGAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE SUCCESSFUL RESCISSION OF

MORTGAGE INSURANCE TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A VIOLATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO THE

GSES AND, THEREFORE, HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES. THE FIRM

ACTIVELY REVIEWS ALL RESCISSION NOTICES FROM MORTGAGE INSURERS AND

CONTESTS THEM WHEN APPROPRIATE.

AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER RECEIVING A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM A GSE, THE FIRM EVALUATES THE

REQUEST AND TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTIONS BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE REPURCHASE DEMAND. LOAN-LEVEL

APPEALS WITH THE GSES ARE TYPICAL AND THE FIRM SEEKS TO PROVIDE A FINAL RESPONSE TO A REPURCHASE

DEMAND WITHIN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OF THE DATE OF RECEIPT. IN MANY CASES, THE FIRM ULTIMATELY IS

NOT REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE A LOAN BECAUSE IT IS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE PURPORTED DEFECT. ALTHOUGH

REPURCHASE DEMANDS MAY BE MADE FOR

AS LONG AS THE LOAN IS OUTSTANDING, MOST REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM

THE GSES HISTORICALLY HAVE RELATED TO LOANS THAT BECAME DELINQUENT IN THE FIRST 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING

ORIGINATION.

WHEN THE FIRM ACCEPTS A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM ONE OF THE GSES, THE FIRM MAY EITHER A) REPURCHASE

THE LOAN OR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL FROM THE GSE AT THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN PLUS

ACCRUED INTEREST, OR B) REIMBURSE THE GSE FOR ITS REALIZED LOSS ON A LIQUIDATED PROPERTY (A

MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT).

ESTIMATED

REPURCHASE LIABILITY

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS REPURCHASE LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS.

(I)

THE LEVEL OF CURRENT UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES,

(II)

ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS CONSIDERING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

(III)

THE POTENTIAL ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS (CURE

RATE),

(IV)

THE ESTIMATED SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OF THE LOAN OR COLLATERAL, MAKE-WHOLE SETTLEMENT, OR

INDEMNIFICATION,

(V)

THE FIRMS POTENTIAL ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS LOSSES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, AND

(VI)

THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURERS AND OTHER PARTIES.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED A REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF $3.3 BILLION AND $1.7

BILLION, INCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL LIABILITY DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE

INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES, EXCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AT EACH OF THE FIVE

MOST RECENT QUARTER-END DATES. DUE TO THE RATE AT WHICH DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS AREA,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL OR MEANINGFUL TO REPORT QUARTERLY INFORMATION

FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009; THE MOST MEANINGFUL TRENDS ARE THOSE

WHICH ARE MORE RECENT.

BECAUSE THE GSES MAY MAKE REPURCHASE DEMANDS BASED ON MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION

NOTICES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED, CERTAIN LOANS MAY BE SUBJECT TO BOTH AN UNRESOLVED MORTGAGE

INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICE AND AN UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMAND.

PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS ARE GENERALLY ESTIMATED BASED ON LOANS THAT ARE OR

EVER HAVE BEEN 90 DAYS PAST DUE. THE FIRM ESTIMATES PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS BY

CONSIDERING THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THESE DELINQUENT LOANS AND EXPECTED REPURCHASE DEMAND

RATES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND DATA, INCLUDING THE AGE OF THE LOAN WHEN IT FIRST BECAME

DELINQUENT. THROUGH THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2010, THE FIRM EXPERIENCED A SUSTAINED TREND OF

INCREASED FILE REQUESTS AND REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES ACROSS MOST VINTAGES, INCLUDING THE

2005-2008 VINTAGES, IN SPITE OF IMPROVED DELINQUENCY STATISTICS AND THE AGING OF THE 2005-2008

VINTAGES. FILE REQUESTS FROM THE GSES, EXCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AND PRIVATE INVESTORS DECREASED BY 29% BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2009 AND REMAINED RELATIVELY

STABLE THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. AFTER THIS PERIOD OF DECLINE AND RELATIVE STABILITY,

FILE REQUESTS FROM THE GSES AND PRIVATE INVESTORS THEN EXPERIENCED QUARTER OVER QUARTER INCREASES

OF 5%, 18% AND 15% IN THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE NUMBER OF

FILE REQUESTS RECEIVED FROM THE GSES AND PRIVATE INVESTORS DECREASED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010,

BUT THE LEVEL OF FILE REQUESTS CONTINUES TO BE ELEVATED AND VOLATILE.

THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THE CHANGE IN GSE BEHAVIOR THAT IT BEGAN TO OBSERVE EARLIER IN 2010 WILL

ALTER THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DELINQUENCIES AND REPURCHASE DEMANDS. IN RESPONSE TO

THESE CHANGING TRENDS, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM REFINED ITS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS BY SEPARATELY FORECASTING NEAR-TERM REPURCHASE DEMANDS (USING OUTSTANDING

FILE REQUESTS) AND LONGER-TERM REPURCHASE DEMANDS (CONSIDERING DELINQUENT LOANS FOR WHICH NO FILE

REQUEST HAS BEEN RECEIVED).

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THIS REFINED ESTIMATION PROCESS PRODUCES A BETTER ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS SINCE IT DIRECTLY INCORPORATES THE FIRMS RECENT FILE REQUEST EXPERIENCE.

THE FIRM ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE REFINED ESTIMATION PROCESS WILL BETTER

REFLECT EMERGING TRENDS IN

FILE REQUESTS AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FILE REQUESTS AND ULTIMATE REPURCHASE DEMANDS.

THIS REFINEMENT IN THE FIRMS ESTIMATION PROCESS RESULTED IN A HIGHER ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PROBABLE

FUTURE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES, AND THIS REVISED FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMAND ASSUMPTION, ALONG WITH AN

OVERALL INCREASE IN REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES DURING 2010, WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE

$1.6 BILLION INCREASE IN THE FIRMS REPURCHASE LIABILITY DURING 2010.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SHOW THE TREND IN REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION

NOTICES RECEIVED BY LOAN ORIGINATION VINTAGE, EXCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL, FOR THE

FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS. DUE TO THE RATE AT WHICH DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS AREA,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL OR MEANINGFUL TO REPORT QUARTERLY INFORMATION

FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009; THE MOST MEANINGFUL TRENDS ARE THOSE

MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM THE GSES

ON A LAGGED BASIS. THIS TABLE INCLUDES MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS WHERE THE GSES HAVE ALSO

ISSUED A REPURCHASE DEMAND.

BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO CURE CERTAIN TYPES OF DEFECTS MORE

FREQUENTLY THAN OTHERS (E.G., MISSING DOCUMENTS), TRENDS IN THE TYPES OF DEFECTS IDENTIFIED AS WELL

AS THE FIRMS HISTORICAL DATA ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE FUTURE CURE RATE. DURING 2010, THE

FIRMS OVERALL CURE RATE, EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL LOANS, HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY 50%. WHILE THE

ACTUAL CURE RATE MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THE OVERALL CURE RATE WILL

REMAIN IN THE 4050% RANGE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE FIRM HAS NOT OBSERVED A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TYPE OF DEFECT THAT CAUSES THE BREACH

OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND THE SEVERITY OF THE REALIZED LOSS. THEREFORE, THE LOSS

SEVERITY ASSUMPTION IS ESTIMATED USING THE FIRMS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING

HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. ACTUAL LOSS SEVERITIES ON FINALIZED REPURCHASES AND MAKE-WHOLE

SETTLEMENTS, EXCLUDING ANY RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL LOANS, CURRENTLY AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 50%,

BUT MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND

CHANGES IN HOME PRICES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEN A LOAN WAS ORIGINATED BY A THIRD-PARTY CORRESPONDENT, THE FIRM TYPICALLY HAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK

A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE CORRESPONDENT ORIGINATOR. CORRESPONDENT-ORIGINATED

LOANS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF LOANS UNDERLYING OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE DEMANDS,

EXCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL. THE FIRM EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN THIRD-PARTY

RECOVERIES FROM LATE 2009 INTO 2010. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY RECOVERY RATE MAY VARY FROM

QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING MIX OF CORRESPONDENTS (E.G., ACTIVE, INACTIVE,

OUT-OF-BUSINESS) FROM WHICH RECOVERIES ARE BEING SOUGHT.

THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH VARIOUS MORTGAGE INSURERS ON THEIR RIGHTS AND PRACTICES OF

RESCINDING MORTGAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH TWO MORTGAGE

INSURERS TO RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS ON CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS A SERVICER. THE IMPACT

OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS REFLECTED IN THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AND THE DISCLOSED OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE

INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS METHODOLOGY

FOR COMPUTING ITS RECORDED REPURCHASE LIABILITYINCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE

FUTURE DEMANDS FROM PURCHASERS (WHICH IS IN PART BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE), THE ABILITY OF

THE FIRM TO CURE IDENTIFIED DEFECTS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE AND

RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIESREQUIRE APPLICATION OF A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

ESTIMATING THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY LIMITED AND RAPIDLY

CHANGING HISTORICAL DATA AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING: (I)

ECONOMIC FACTORS (E.G., FURTHER DECLINES IN HOME PRICES AND CHANGES IN BORROWER BEHAVIOR MAY LEAD

TO INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES, OR BOTH), AND (II) THE LEVEL OF

FUTURE DEMANDS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS THE GSES

AND MORTGAGE INSURERS. WHILE THE FIRM USES THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT IN ESTIMATING ITS

REPURCHASE LIABILITY, THE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, IMPRECISE AND POTENTIALLY

VOLATILE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE

POSITION. THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRATEGY FOCUSES ON LONG-TERM STABILITY, WHICH ENABLES IT TO BUILD AND

INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRENGTH PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISION ON FUTURE

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. CAPITAL AND EARNINGS ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED, AS EARNINGS DIRECTLY AFFECT

CAPITAL GENERATION FOR THE FIRM. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE FIRMS EARNINGS OUTLOOK, SENIOR

MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL AND MAKES DECISIONS TO VARY SOURCES OR USES TO

PRESERVE THE FIRMS CAPITAL STRENGTH.

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO HOLD CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO.



COVER ALL MATERIAL RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;



MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;



ACHIEVE DEBT RATING TARGETS;



REMAIN FLEXIBLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES; AND



BUILD AND INVEST IN BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED

ENVIRONMENT.

TO MEET

THESE OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A ROBUST AND DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT

PROCESS, WHICH IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY, AND WHICH IS INTENDED TO ENABLE THE FIRM TO REMAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED AND FUND ONGOING

OPERATIONS UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS. THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON EARNINGS AND CAPITAL FOR THE FIRMS BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALLY AND

IN THE AGGREGATE OVER A ROLLING THREE-YEAR PERIOD. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS

UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BUSINESSES.

THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE KEY DRIVERS OF

BUSINESS RESULTS; GLOBAL MARKET SHOCKS, WHICH GENERATE SHORT-TERM BUT SEVERE TRADING LOSSES; AND

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS, WHICH GENERATE SIGNIFICANT ONE-TIME LOSSES. HOWEVER, EVEN WHEN DEFINING A

BROAD RANGE OF SCENARIOS, REALIZED EVENTS CAN ALWAYS BE WORSE. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS

ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS AS NECESSARY. THE FIRM UTILIZED THIS CAPITAL ADEQUACY

PROCESS IN COMPLETING THE FEDERAL RESERVE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN. THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL

ADEQUACY IS ALSO EVALUATED TOGETHER WITH THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE

PAGES 110115 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL ARE KEY FACTORS IN SENIOR MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION OF THE

FIRMS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ITS CAPITAL IN THE FORM OF

COMMON EQUITY. THE FIRM USES THREE CAPITAL DISCIPLINES.



REGULATORY CAPITAL

 THE CAPITAL REQUIRED ACCORDING TO STANDARDS STIPULATED BY U.S. BANK

REGULATORY AGENCIES.



ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

 A BOTTOM-UP ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES.



LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

 THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY THE FIRM BELIEVES EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT

WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, WHICH INCORPORATES SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO

ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR

SIMILARLY RATED PEERS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS, FOR

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)

ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009, U.S.

BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED A NEW MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1

CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY  SUCH AS PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. TIER 1 COMMON, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USED BY BANKING REGULATORS, INVESTORS

AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL WITH THE

CAPITAL OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON ALONG WITH THE OTHER

CAPITAL MEASURES TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS

OF THE WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS INDICATED IN THE TABLES

BELOW. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE 4% WELL-CAPITALIZED

STANDARD ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF THE SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. FOR MORE

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS CONSIST OF ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE

OF SEVERAL BROAD RISK CATEGORIES AND WEIGHTED BY FACTORS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK AND POTENTIAL

FOR DEFAULT. ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE PERCEIVED CREDIT RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY, THE NATURE OF ANY COLLATERAL, AND THE GUARANTOR,

IF ANY. OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS  SUCH AS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES,

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER APPLICABLE OFFBALANCE SHEET POSITIONS  ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BY

MULTIPLYING THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT BY THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT CONVERSION FACTOR TO DETERMINE

THE ONBALANCE SHEET CREDIT-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT, WHICH IS THEN RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE SAME

FACTORS USED FOR ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ALSO INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR

THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO APPLICABLE TRADING ASSETSDEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. THE RESULTING RISK-WEIGHTED VALUES FOR EACH OF THE RISK

CATEGORIES ARE THEN AGGREGATED TO DETERMINE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

(D)

INCLUDES OFFBALANCE SHEET RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, OF $282.9

BILLION AND $367.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ARE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH U.S. FEDERAL REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS.

(E)

ADJUSTED AVERAGE ASSETS, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE LEVERAGE RATIO, INCLUDE

TOTAL AVERAGE ASSETS ADJUSTED FOR UNREALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) ON SECURITIES, LESS DEDUCTIONS FOR

DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, AND THE

TOTAL ADJUSTED CARRYING VALUE OF NONFINANCIAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

DEDUCTIONS FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL.

THE FIRMS TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL WAS $114.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $105.3

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN INCREASE OF $9.5 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO

NET INCOME (ADJUSTED FOR DVA) OF $17.0 BILLION AND NET ISSUANCES AND COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE COMMON

STOCK UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OF $2.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $4.4 BILLION OF CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENTS TO RETAINED EARNINGS THAT

PREDOMINANTLY RESULTED FROM THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES; $3.0 BILLION

OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES; $1.5 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK; AND A $1.3

BILLION REDUCTION RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY

FROM NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS. THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL WAS $142.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010, COMPARED WITH $133.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AN INCREASE OF $9.5 BILLION. THE INCREASE

IN TIER 1 CAPITAL REFLECTED THE INCREASE IN TIER 1 COMMON AND A NET ISSUANCE OF TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, OFFSET BY THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FEDERAL REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL RATIOS OF

THE FIRM AND THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT BANKING SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, SEE NOTE 29

ON PAGES 273274 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BASEL II

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (BASEL I). IN 2004, THE BASEL

COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO

PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS

PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH REQUIRES JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT BASEL

II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS KEY U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE

A QUALIFICATION PERIOD OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS DURING WHICH IT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT

MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS PRIMARY U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. THE

U.S. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE CONSISTS OF THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD, STARTING NO LATER THAN APRIL 1,

2010, FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM TRANSITION PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, BASEL

II RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT FALL BELOW CERTAIN FLOORS

BASED ON CURRENT BASEL I REGULATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD AND EXPECTS TO BE IN

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

HAS ADOPTED, AND WILL CON-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TINUE TO ADOPT, BASED ON VARIOUS ESTABLISHED TIMELINES, BASEL II RULES IN

CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

BASEL III

IN ADDITION TO THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK, ON DECEMBER 16, 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED THE FINAL

VERSION OF THE CAPITAL ACCORD, CALLED BASEL III, WHICH INCLUDED NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF

CAPITAL, INCREASING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES, INTRODUCING SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

COVERAGE AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AND ESTABLISHING AN INTERNATIONAL LEVERAGE RATIO. THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ALSO ANNOUNCED HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL III WHICH PROVIDE THAT THE

COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENT WILL BE INCREASED TO 7%, COMPRISED OF A MINIMUM OF 4.5% PLUS A 2.5%

CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE PUBLISHED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PROPOSED

RISK-BASED CAPITAL FLOORS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT TO ESTABLISH A

PERMANENT BASEL I FLOOR UNDER BASEL II / BASEL III CAPITAL CALCULATIONS.

THE FIRM FULLY EXPECTS TO

BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HIGHER BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS WHEN THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY

1, 2019, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DODD-FRANK ACT CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHEN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED. THE

FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL III RULES (INCLUDING THE CHANGES FOR

CALCULATING CAPITAL ON TRADING ASSETS AND SECURITIZATIONS) WOULD BE 7% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

THIS ESTIMATE REFLECTS THE FIRMS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASEL III RULES AND THEIR

APPLICATION TO ITS BUSINESSES AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED; ACCORDINGLY, THIS ESTIMATE WILL EVOLVE OVER

TIME AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES CHANGE AND AS A RESULT OF FURTHER RULE-MAKING ON BASEL III

IMPLEMENTATION FROM U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. THE FIRM ALSO BELIEVES IT MAY NEED TO MODIFY THE

CURRENT LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

COVERAGE AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS CONTAINED IN BASEL III. THE BASEL III REVISIONS

GOVERNING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PROLONGED OBSERVATION AND TRANSITION

PERIODS. THE OBSERVATION PERIOD FOR THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND

TERM FUNDING STANDARDS BEGINS IN 2011, WITH

IMPLEMENTATION IN 2015 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE TRANSITION PERIOD FOR BANKS TO MEET THE REVISED COMMON EQUITY

REQUIREMENT WILL BEGIN IN 2013, WITH IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO

MONITOR THE ONGOING RULE-MAKING PROCESS TO ASSESS BOTH THE TIMING AND THE IMPACT OF BASEL III ON

ITS BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES

ARE J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (JPMORGAN SECURITIES; FORMERLY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.), AND

J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. (JPMORGAN CLEARING). JPMORGAN SECURITIES BECAME A LIMITED LIABILITY

COMPANY ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2010. JPMORGAN CLEARING IS A SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND PROVIDES

CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES. JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND JPMORGAN CLEARING ARE EACH SUBJECT TO

RULE 15C3-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE NET CAPITAL RULE). JPMORGAN SECURITIES

AND JPMORGAN CLEARING ARE ALSO REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION

MERCHANTS AND SUBJECT TO RULE 1.17

OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC).

JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND JPMORGAN CLEARING HAVE ELECTED TO COMPUTE THEIR MINIMUM NET CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE NET CAPITAL RULE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN SECURITIES NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY THE NET CAPITAL RULE, WAS

$6.9 BILLION, EXCEEDING THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT BY $6.3 BILLION, AND JPMORGAN CLEARINGS NET

CAPITAL WAS $5.7 BILLION, EXCEEDING THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT BY $3.9 BILLION.

IN ADDITION TO ITS MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT, JPMORGAN SECURITIES IS REQUIRED TO HOLD

TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION AND IS ALSO REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) IN THE EVENT THAT TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5.0 BILLION, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF THE NET CAPITAL RULE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN SECURITIES HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM AND

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RELATIVE TO THE RISKS UNDERLYING ITS BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, USING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM MEASURES ECONOMIC CAPITAL

PRIMARILY BASED ON FOUR RISK FACTORS: CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK.

RATING OBJECTIVES.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) AND

CONSUMER BUSINESSES (RFS AND CS).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND FROM DECLINES IN THE PORTFOLIO VALUE DUE TO CREDIT

DETERIORATION MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT

RATING STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THOSE FOR WHICH ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ARE MAINTAINED. THE CAPITAL METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT

RISK: EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD, CREDIT SPREADS, LOSS

SEVERITY AND PORTFOLIO CORRELATION.

104

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK

SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT-LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT RATING STANDARD.

SEE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 116118 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

CREDIT RISK MEASURES.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE

RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN

MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, AND SECURITIES AND

COMMODITIES PRICES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. RESULTS FROM

DAILY VAR, BIWEEKLY STRESS-TESTS, ISSUER CREDIT SPREADS AND DEFAULT RISK CALCULATIONS, AS WELL AS

OTHER FACTORS, ARE USED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. MARKET RISK CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED

TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT BASED ON ITS RISK ASSESSMENT. SEE MARKET

RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 142146

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL RISK ON A BOTTOM-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED ON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

OR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL II

FRAMEWORK. SEE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 147148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE

INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATIONAL RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY- AND PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS, AND

COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE

IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS,

POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY LIQUIDITY RISK.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS EXPERIENCE

SUFFERED BY THE FIRM AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET

CONDITIONS.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN

EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS;



MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF

IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK

MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. CAPITAL IS

ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS. RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY IS MEASURED

AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS KEY MEASURES OF A BUSINESS SEGMENTS

PERFORMANCE.

CAPITALIZED BASED ON THE TIER 1 COMMON STANDARD, RATHER THAN THE TIER 1 CAPITAL STANDARD. IN 2011,

FUTURE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

DIVIDENDS

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID ON APRIL 30, 2009, TO SHAREHOLDERS

OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009. THE ACTION ENABLED THE FIRM TO RETAIN APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION IN

COMMON EQUITY IN EACH OF 2010 AND 2009, AND WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE FIRM HAD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL

STRENGTH IN THE EVENT THE VERY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE BEGINNING OF 2009

DETERIORATED FURTHER. JPMORGAN CHASE DECLARED QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE

AMOUNT OF $0.05 PER SHARE FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2010 AND 2009.

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM

PURSUANT

TO THE U.S. TREASURYS CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S.

TREASURY, FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION, (I) 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK,

AND (II) A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTIDILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. ON JUNE 17, 2009,

THE FIRM REDEEMED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK AND REPAID THE FULL

$25.0 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TOGETHER WITH ACCRUED DIVIDENDS. THE U.S. TREASURY EXCHANGED THE

WARRANT FOR 88,401,697 WARRANTS, EACH OF WHICH IS A WARRANT TO PURCHASE A SHARE OF THE FIRMS

COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE, AND, ON DECEMBER 11, 2009, SOLD THE WARRANTS

IN A SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING FOR $950 MILLION. THE FIRM DID NOT PURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS SOLD

BY THE U.S. TREASURY.

STOCK REPURCHASES

UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE FIRM IS

AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK PLUS THE 88 MILLION

WARRANTS SOLD BY THE U.S. TREASURY IN 2009. DURING 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT

REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK OR WARRANTS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM

RESUMED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND DURING THE YEAR REPURCHASED AN

AGGREGATE OF 78 MILLION SHARES

FOR $3.0 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $38.49. THE FIRMS SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES IN

2010 WERE INTENDED TO OFFSET SHARECOUNT INCREASES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE

AWARDS AND WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GOAL OF MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE SHARECOUNT. THE FIRM

DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS DURING 2010. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, $3.2 BILLION OF

AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMON STOCK, AND ALL OF THE AUTHORIZED

REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE WARRANTS.

THE FIRM MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE

ITS EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE,

DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE

ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION.

THE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT MANAGEMENTS

DISCRETION, AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND THE EXACT NUMBER OF SHARES AND WARRANTS PURCHASED IS

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH

OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF RULE

10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME.

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND

ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS TAKEN IN ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A HOLISTIC

APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF RISK TYPES ARE CONSIDERED IN MANAGING

ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO CREATE A CULTURE OF

RISK AWARENESS AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE FIRM WHERE COLLABORATION, DISCUSSION,

ESCALATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION IS ENCOURAGED.

THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK APPETITE IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL, EARNINGS

POWER, AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS MODEL. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A FORMAL RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK TO

CLEARLY LINK RISK APPETITE AND RETURN TARGETS, CONTROLS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THE FIRMS CEO IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE OVERALL RISK APPETITE OF THE FIRM AND THE LOB CEOS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

SETTING THE RISK APPETITE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE RISK POLICY

COMMITTEE OF THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES THE RISK APPETITE POLICY ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE RISK INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS, ALBEIT WITH APPROPRIATE CORPORATE

OVERSIGHT. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING THE

BUSINESS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND CONTROLS.

OVERLAYING LINE OF BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT ARE FOUR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK

MANAGEMENTRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES: RISK MANAGEMENT, THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE, CORPORATE

TREASURY, AND LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE.

RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT AND

CONTROLS, AND IS VIEWED AS A PARTNER IN ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. RISK MANAGEMENT

COORDINATES AND COMMUNICATES WITH EACH LINE OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEES AND CHIEF RISK OFFICERS TO MANAGE RISK. THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS HEADED BY THE

FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE AND WHO REPORTS TO THE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY

COMMITTEE. THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES. WITHIN

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL

RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AS WELL AS RISK REPORTING, RISK POLICY AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS. RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AND CORPORATE TREASURY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING,

REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, AND OTHER

STRUCTURAL RISKS.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE HAS OVERSIGHT FOR LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, AN ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND

THREE OTHER RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES  THE RISK WORKING GROUP, THE GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY COMMITTEE

AND THE MARKETS COMMITTEE. ALL OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE

MEMBERSHIP OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM, INCLUDING

REPRESENTATIVES OF LINES OF BUSINESS, RISK MANAGEMENT, FINANCE AND OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE

COMMITTEES MEET FREQUENTLY TO DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS, RISK EXPOSURES, AND RISK CONCENTRATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE

IMPACT OF RISK FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED BROADLY ACROSS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE TREASURER, MONITORS THE FIRMS

OVERALL INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY RISK. ALCO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. ALCO ALSO REVIEWS THE FIRMS FUNDS TRANSFER

PRICING POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF BUSINESS TRANSFER INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

TO CORPORATE TREASURY IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT), EARNINGS AT RISK, OVERALL INTEREST

RATE POSITION, FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND STRATEGY, AND THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS (AND ANY

REQUIRED LIQUIDITY SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF SUCH PROGRAMS).

THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OVERSEES GLOBAL MERGER

AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE

SCOPE OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

THE RISK WORKING GROUP, CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW ISSUES

THAT CROSS LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS RISK POLICY, RISK METHODOLOGY, RISK CONCENTRATIONS, REGULATORY

CAPITAL AND OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES, AND SUCH OTHER TOPICS REFERRED TO IT BY LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEES.

THE MARKETS COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, MEETS WEEKLY TO REVIEW, MONITOR

AND DISCUSS SIGNIFICANT RISK MATTERS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK ISSUES;

MARKET MOVING EVENTS; LARGE TRANSACTIONS; HEDGING STRATEGIES; REPUTATION RISK; CONFLICTS OF

INTEREST; AND OTHER ISSUES.

THE GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, REVIEWS EXPOSURES TO

COUNTERPARTIES WHEN SUCH EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE ABOVE PORTFOLIO-ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. THE COMMITTEE

MEETS QUARTERLY TO REVIEW TOTAL EXPOSURES WITH THESE COUNTERPARTIES, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

COUNTERPARTY TRADING EXPOSURES TO ENSURE THAT SUCH EXPOSURES ARE DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THE

FIRMS TRADING ACTIVITIES, AND TO DIRECT CHANGES IN EXPOSURE LEVELS AS NEEDED.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARDS

RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT

RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

OVERSIGHT OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT

GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND

MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF

COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS

SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION: THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS DEALINGS,

INCLUDING LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, IS IDENTIFIED AND AGGREGATED THROUGH THE

FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESTIMATING POTENTIAL

LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC OR UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT MAY NOT BE CAPTURED IN OTHER

MODELS, AND FOR COMMUNICATING THOSE RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.



RISK MEASUREMENT: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING

CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS TESTS

AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE

ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO INTERNAL MODEL REVIEW,

EMPIRICAL VALIDATION AND BENCHMARKING WITH THE

GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE RISK OF

THE UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL: THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCORPORATE

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY

AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING: THE FIRM REPORTS RISK EXPOSURES ON BOTH A LINE OF BUSINESS AND A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SURPLUS LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY

THROUGH ECONOMIC CYCLES IS CRUCIAL TO FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY DURING PERIODS OF

ADVERSE CONDITIONS. THE FIRMS FUNDING STRATEGY IS INTENDED TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND DIVERSITY OF

FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET ACTUAL AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THROUGH BOTH NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE A DIVERSIFIED DEPOSIT BASE, WHICH WAS $930.4

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND ACCESS TO THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND LONG-TERM UNSECURED AND

SECURED FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND BORROWINGS FROM FHLBS. ADDITIONALLY,

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS LARGE POOLS OF HIGHLY-LIQUID UNENCUMBERED ASSETS. THE FIRM ACTIVELY

MONITORS THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS ACROSS VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND

IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE FUNDING FROM A BROAD RANGE OF SOURCES IN A

VARIETY OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AND IN A RANGE OF TENORS IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY AND LIMIT FUNDING CONCENTRATION RISK.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION TO BE STRONG, BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY METRICS AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND BELIEVES THAT THE FIRMS UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS

SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THE

FUNDING MARKETS AS NEEDED DURING 2010 AND THROUGHOUT THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS.

GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS GOVERNANCE PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINS STRONG. THE

ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING

PLAN. CORPORATE TREASURY FORMULATES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY

AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN AS WELL AS MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE. JPMORGAN CHASE CENTRALIZES THE MANAGEMENT OF GLOBAL FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

RISK WITHIN CORPORATE TREASURY TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS, MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS AND ENHANCE

GLOBAL IDENTIFICATION AND COORDINATION OF LIQUIDITY RISK. THIS CENTRALIZED APPROACH INVOLVES

FREQUENT COMMUNICATION WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, DISCIPLINED MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY AT THE

PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, COMPREHENSIVE MARKET-BASED PRICING OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

CONTINUOUS BALANCE SHEET MONITORING, FREQUENT STRESS TESTING OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES, AND FREQUENT

REPORTING TO AND COMMUNICATION WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

LIQUIDITY MONITORING

THE FIRM EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF METRICS TO MONITOR AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY. ONE SET OF ANALYSES USED BY

THE FIRM RELATES TO THE TIMING OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES VERSUS LIQUIDITY USES (E.G., FUNDING GAP

ANALYSIS AND PARENT HOLDING COMPANY FUNDING, WHICH IS DISCUSSED BELOW). A SECOND SET OF ANALYSES

FOCUSES ON RATIOS OF FUNDING AND LIQUID COLLATERAL (E.G., MEASUREMENTS OF THE FIRMS RELIANCE ON

SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS ANALYSES OF THE

RELATIONSHIP OF SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING TO HIGHLY-LIQUID ASSETS, THE DEPOSITS-TO-LOANS RATIO

AND OTHER BALANCE SHEET MEASURES).

THE FIRM PERFORMS REGULAR LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MONITORING. THE PURPOSE

OF THE LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM UNDER BOTH

IDIOSYNCRATIC AND SYSTEMIC MARKET STRESS CONDITIONS. THESE SCENARIOS EVALUATE THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

POSITION ACROSS A FULL YEAR HORIZON BY ANALYZING THE NET FUNDING GAPS RESULTING FROM CONTRACTUAL

AND CONTINGENT CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS VERSUS BY THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL

LIQUIDITY BY PLEDGING OR SELLING EXCESS COLLATERAL AND ISSUING UNSECURED DEBT. THE SCENARIOS ARE

PRODUCED FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND MAJOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS THE FIRMS MAJOR

U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES.

THE IDIOSYNCRATIC STRESS SCENARIO EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM IS A JPMORGAN CHASE-SPECIFIC EVENT THAT

EVALUATES THE FIRMS NET FUNDING GAP AFTER A SHORT-TERM RATINGS DOWNGRADE FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF

A-1+/P-1 TO A-2/P-2. THE SYSTEMIC MARKET STRESS SCENARIO EVALUATES THE FIRMS NET FUNDING GAP

DURING A PERIOD OF SEVERE MARKET STRESS SIMILAR TO MARKET CONDITIONS IN 2008 AND ASSUMES THE FIRM

IS NOT UNIQUELY STRESSED VERSUS ITS PEERS. THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

POSITION IS STRONG UNDER THE FIRM-DEFINED STRESS SCENARIOS OUTLINED

ABOVE.

PARENT HOLDING COMPANY

LIQUIDITY MONITORING ON THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH BANK SUBSIDIARIES MAY EXTEND CREDIT TO THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY

AND OTHER NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES. EXCESS CASH GENERATED BY PARENT HOLDING COMPANY ISSUANCE ACTIVITY

IS PLACED WITH BOTH BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES IN THE FORM OF DEPOSITS AND ADVANCES TO SATISFY A

PORTION OF SUBSIDIARY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THE REMAINDER OF THE EXCESS CASH IS USED TO PURCHASE

LIQUID COLLATERAL THROUGH REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO

GENERATE REPLACEMENT FUNDING IN THE EVENT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF THE

AFOREMENTIONED DEPOSITS AND ADVANCES.

110

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS THE ABILITY OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY TO MEET ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS

WITH LIQUID SOURCES OF CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT ACCESS TO

THE UNSECURED FUNDING MARKETS. THE FIRM TARGETS PRE-FUNDING OF PARENT HOLDING COMPANY OBLIGATIONS

FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS; HOWEVER, DUE TO CONSERVATIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM

IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE CURRENT PRE-FUNDING OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

THAN TARGET.

GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE

IN ADDITION TO THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY 

PRIMARILY AT ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BUT ALSO AT ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY

RESERVE REPRESENTS CONSOLIDATED SOURCES OF AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING CASH ON

DEPOSIT AT CENTRAL BANKS, AND CASH PROCEEDS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN SECURED

FINANCINGS OF HIGHLY LIQUID, UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES  SUCH AS GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT, GOVERNMENT-

AND FDIC-GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY DEBT AND AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES (MBS). THE LIQUIDITY AMOUNT ANTICIPATED TO BE REALIZED FROM SECURED FINANCINGS IS

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT JUDGMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS ABILITY TO QUICKLY RAISE

SECURED FINANCINGS. THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE ALSO INCLUDES THE FIRMS BORROWING CAPACITY AT

VARIOUS FHLBS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS FROM

COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY THE FIRM TO SUCH BANKS. ALTHOUGH CONSIDERED AS A SOURCE OF AVAILABLE

LIQUIDITY, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW

AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE GLOBAL

LIQUIDITY RESERVE WAS APPROXIMATELY $262 BILLION.

IN ADDITION TO THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE, THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF OTHER

HIGH-QUALITY, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE TO RAISE LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS CORPORATE DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

BASEL III

ON DECEMBER 16, 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED THE FINAL BASEL III RULES PERTAINING TO CAPITAL

AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY COVERAGE  THE

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (THE LCR)  AND TERM FUNDING  THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (THE

NSFR). THESE MINIMUM STANDARDS WILL BE PHASED IN OVER TIME. THE OBSERVATION PERIOD FOR BOTH THE

LCR AND THE NSFR COMMENCES IN 2011, WITH IMPLEMENTATION IN 2015 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. FOR MORE

INFORMATION, SEE THE DISCUSSION ON BASEL III ON PAGE 104 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

A KEY STRENGTH OF THE FIRM IS ITS DIVERSIFIED DEPOSIT FRANCHISE, THROUGH THE RFS, CB, TSS AND AM

LINES OF BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING AND DECREASES RELIANCE ON THE

WHOLESALE MARKETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE $930.4 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $938.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. AVERAGE TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE $881.1

BILLION DURING 2010, COMPARED WITH $882.0 BILLION DURING 2009. THE FIRM TYPICALLY EXPERIENCES

HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES AT PERIOD ENDS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SEASONAL CUSTOMER DEPOSIT INFLOWS. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS DEPOSITS ARE RETAIL DEPOSITS (40% AND 38% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY), WHICH ARE CONSIDERED PARTICULARLY STABLE AS THEY ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES OR MARKET VOLATILITY. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE DEPOSITS

ARE ALSO CONSIDERED STABLE SOURCES OF FUNDING DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS FROM WHICH

THEY ARE GENERATED, PARTICULARLY CUSTOMERS OPERATING SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRMS DEPOSITS-TO-LOANS RATIO WAS 134%, COMPARED WITH 148% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009. THE DECLINE IN THE FIRMS DEPOSITS-TO-LOANS RATIO WAS PREDOMINATELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

LOANS RESULTING FROM THE JANUARY 1, 2010, IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO

VIES. THE IMPACT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON THE DEPOSITS-TO-LOANS RATIO WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY CONTINUED ATTRITION OF THE HERITAGE WASHINGTON MUTUAL RESIDENTIAL LOAN AND CREDIT CARD LOAN

PORTFOLIOS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF DEPOSIT AND LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF

THE RESULTS FOR THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE BALANCE

SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES 6988 AND

9294, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE ADOPTION OF THE

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGES 164165 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDE A VARIETY OF UNSECURED AND SECURED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM

INSTRUMENTS. SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS AND EURODOLLARS PURCHASED,

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BANK NOTES. LONG-TERM UNSECURED

FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK

AND COMMON STOCK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRMS SHORT-TERM SECURED SOURCES OF FUNDING CONSIST OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER

AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND BORROWINGS FROM THE CHICAGO, PITTSBURGH AND SAN FRANCISCO FHLBS.

SECURED LONG-TERM FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS, AND BORROWINGS FROM THE

CHICAGO, PITTSBURGH AND SAN FRANCISCO FHLBS.

FUNDING MARKETS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE GLOBAL BALANCE OF

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING AT FAVORABLE RATES.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING

THE FIRMS RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS FEDERAL FUNDS AND EURODOLLARS

PURCHASED, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BANK NOTES IS LIMITED.

TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES FOR THE FIRM WERE $35.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010,

COMPARED WITH $41.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. HOWEVER, OF THOSE TOTALS, $29.2 BILLION AND

$28.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, ORIGINATED FROM DEPOSITS THAT

CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO SWEEP INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES AS A CASH MANAGEMENT PRODUCT OFFERED BY

THE FIRM. THEREFORE, COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES SOURCED FROM WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS WERE $6.2

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $13.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THERE WERE NO

MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AVERAGE AND YEAR-END BALANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING FOR

THE YEAR ENDED AND AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE ARE SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY HIGH QUALITY

SECURITIES COLLATERAL, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT, AGENCY DEBT AND AGENCY MBS. THE BALANCES

OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, WHICH CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WAS

$273.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $253.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THERE

WERE NO MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AVERAGE AND YEAR-END BALANCES OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD

UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED AND AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE BALANCES

ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FLUCTUATE OVER TIME DUE TO

CUSTOMERS INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES; THE FIRMS DEMAND FOR FINANCING; THE FIRMS MATCHED

BOOK ACTIVITY; THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MIX OF THE FIRMS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ITS SECURED

AND UNSECURED FINANCING (FOR BOTH THE INVESTMENT AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS); AND OTHER MARKET AND

PORTFOLIO FACTORS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE THE BALANCE SHEET

ANALYSIS ON PAGES 9294, NOTE

13 ON PAGE 219 AND NOTE 20 ON PAGE 264 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF TOTAL OTHER BORROWED FUNDS FOR THE FIRM WAS $34.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $32.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE AVERAGE AND YEAR-END BALANCES OF OTHER BORROWED FUNDS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AND AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE THE TABLE FOR SHORT-TERM AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS ON PAGE 299 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM FUNDING AND ISSUANCE

DURING 2010, THE FIRM ISSUED $36.1 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING $17.1 BILLION OF SENIOR

NOTES ISSUED IN THE U.S. MARKET, $2.9 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN THE NON-U.S. MARKETS, $1.5

BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, AND $14.6 BILLION OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES. IN

ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2011, THE FIRM ISSUED $4.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING $3.5 BILLION

OF SENIOR NOTES IN THE U.S. MARKET AND $800 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN NON-U.S. MARKETS.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM ISSUED $19.7 BILLION OF FDIC-GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT UNDER THE TEMPORARY

LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM. DURING 2009, THE FIRM ALSO ISSUED NON-FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT OF $16.1

BILLION (INCLUDING $11.0 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES AND $2.5 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE U.S. MARKET, AND $2.6 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN NON-U.S. MARKETS)

AND $15.5 BILLION OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES. DURING 2010, $53.4 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURED OR

WERE REDEEMED, INCLUDING $907 MILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES REDEEMED ON

DECEMBER 28, 2010, THROUGH A TENDER OFFER, AND $22.8 BILLION OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES. DURING 2009,

$55.7 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) MATURED OR WERE

REDEEMED, INCLUDING $27.2 BILLION OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES.

IN ADDITION TO THE UNSECURED LONG-TERM FUNDING AND ISSUANCES DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE FIRM SECURITIZES

CONSUMER CREDIT CARD LOANS, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AUTO LOANS AND STUDENT LOANS FOR FUNDING

PURPOSES. LOANS SECURITIZED BY THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN

TRANSACTIONS AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE FIRM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2010, CERTAIN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD LOAN, STUDENT LOAN AND AUTO LOAN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

WERE CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. AS A RESULT OF

CONSOLIDATING THESE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, THE MATURITIES OR REDEMPTIONS OF THE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE FIRMS CASH FLOWS

FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. DURING 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT SECURITIZE ANY CREDIT CARD LOANS,

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AUTO LOANS OR STUDENT LOANS THROUGH CONSOLIDATED OR NONCONSOLIDATED

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. DURING 2009, THE FIRM SECURITIZED $26.5 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS VIA

NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. DURING 2010, $25.8 BILLION OF LOAN SECURITIZATIONS MATURED

OR WERE REDEEMED,

INCLUDING $24.9 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, $210 MILLION OF AUTO LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS, $294 MILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND $326 MILLION OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2010, THE FIRM BORROWED $18.7 BILLION OF NEW LONG-TERM ADVANCES FROM THE FHLBS, WHICH WERE

OFFSET BY $18.6 BILLION OF MATURITIES. DURING 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT ACCESS THE FHLBS FOR ANY NEW

LONG-TERM ADVANCES AND MATURITIES WERE $9.5 BILLION DURING THE PERIOD.

TERMINATION OF REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN OF ITS TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND ITS

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, THE FIRM HAD ENTERED INTO REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS

(RCCS). THESE RCCS GRANTED CERTAIN RIGHTS TO THE HOLDERS OF COVERED DEBT, AS DEFINED IN THE

RCCS, THAT PROHIBITED THE REPAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR PURCHASE OF SUCH TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES AND NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK EXCEPT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO THE

EXTENT THAT JPMORGAN CHASE HAD RECEIVED, IN EACH SUCH CASE, SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALE OF CERTAIN QUALIFYING SECURITIES. ON DECEMBER 10, 2010, THE FIRM RECEIVED CONSENTS FROM THE

HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY IN LIQUIDATION AMOUNT OF THE COVERED DEBT TO THE TERMINATION OF THE RCCS, AND

THE FIRM TERMINATED THE RCCS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS.

CASH FLOWS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS INCREASED $1.4

BILLION, AND DECREASED $689 MILLION AND $13.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASES CASH FLOWS DURING

2010, 2009 AND 2008.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE.

OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, MARKET CONDITIONS

AND TRADING STRATEGIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND

THE FIRMS OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.8 BILLION,

MAINLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE PRIMARILY IN TRADING ASSETSDEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS; PRINCIPALLY

DUE TO IMPROVED MARKET ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IN EQUITY SECURITIES, FOREIGN DEBT AND PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF POSITIONS TAKEN TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER DRIVEN TRADING. NET CASH WAS PROVIDED BY NET INCOME AND FROM

ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. ADDITIONALLY, PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WERE HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH

LOANS.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$122.8 BILLION AND $23.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2009, THE NET DECLINE IN TRADING ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES WAS AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF THE CHALLENGING CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTED

IN 2008, AND CONTINUED INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2009. IN 2009 AND 2008, NET CASH GENERATED FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH

ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. IN ADDITION, FOR 2009 AND 2008 PROCEEDS FROM SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WERE

HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS, BUT THE CASH FLOWS FROM THESE LOAN ACTIVITIES

REMAINED AT REDUCED LEVELS AS A RESULT OF THE LOWER ACTIVITY IN THESE MARKETS.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE LOANS ORIGINATED TO BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT,

THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010, NET CASH OF $54.0 BILLION WAS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED

FROM A DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS LARGELY DUE TO A DECLINE IN DEPOSITS PLACED WITH THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK AND LOWER INTERBANK LENDING AS MARKET STRESS EASED SINCE THE END OF 2009; NET SALES

AND MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES USED IN THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

LARGELY DUE TO REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO IN CORPORATE, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE INTEREST

RATE ENVIRONMENT AND TO REBALANCE EXPOSURES; AND A NET DECREASE IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, DRIVEN BY

THE EXPECTED RUNOFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, A DECLINE IN LOWER-YIELDING

PROMOTIONAL CREDIT CARD BALANCES, CONTINUED RUNOFF OF THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS, AND

REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES IN IB AND CB; THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ORIGINATIONS

ACROSS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WAS AN

INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER FINANCING

VOLUME IN IB; AND CASH USED FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY RBS SEMPRA.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, NET CASH OF $29.4 BILLION WAS PROVIDED BY INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FROM A DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING LOWER DEMAND FOR INTER-BANK

LENDING AND LOWER DEPOSITS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RELATIVE TO THE ELEVATED LEVELS AT THE END

OF 2008; A NET DECREASE IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND AND LOAN SALES IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, LOWER CHARGE VOLUME ON CREDIT CARDS,

SLIGHTLY HIGHER CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, AND PAYDOWNS; AND THE MATURITY OF ALL ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AML FACILITY OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON. LARGELY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WERE NET PURCHASES OF AFS

SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND INVESTMENT OF CASH

RESULTING FROM AN EXCESS FUNDING POSITION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

113

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, NET CASH OF $283.7 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY FOR: INCREASED DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AS THE RESULT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF EXCESS CASH FOR

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH INTERBANK LENDING, AND RESERVE BALANCES HELD BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE (WHICH BECAME AN INVESTING ACTIVITY IN 2008, REFLECTING A POLICY CHANGE OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE TO PAY INTEREST TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ON RESERVE BALANCES); NET PURCHASES OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN THE AFS PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

MOVEMENTS; NET ADDITIONS TO THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO FROM ORGANIC GROWTH IN CB; ADDITIONS TO

THE CONSUMER PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO RETAIN, RATHER THAN SELL, NEW

ORIGINATIONS OF NONCONFORMING PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS; AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS REFLECTING GROWTH IN DEMAND FROM CLIENTS FOR LIQUIDITY; AND NET PURCHASES OF

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY FACILITY (AML FACILITY) OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE USES OF CASH WERE PROCEEDS FROM LOAN SALES AND

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS NET CASH RECEIVED FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE SALE OF AN

INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY, IN JUNE 2008, IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE FIRM SOLD

ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM BEAR STEARNS TO THE FRBNY AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $28.85 BILLION.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECT CASH FLOWS RELATED TO RAISING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS,

AND ISSUING LONG-TERM

DEBT (INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES) AS WELL AS PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK. IN

2010, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $49.2 BILLION. THIS RESULTED FROM NET PAYMENTS OF

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AS NEW ISSUANCES WERE MORE THAN

OFFSET BY PAYMENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECLINE IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED

VIES DUE TO MATURITIES RELATED TO FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; A DECLINE IN

DEPOSITS ASSOCIATED WITH WHOLESALE FUNDING ACTIVITIES DUE TO THE FIRMS LOWER FUNDING NEEDS; LOWER

DEPOSIT LEVELS IN TSS, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NET INFLOWS FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS IN

AM, CB AND RFS; A DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS DUE TO LOWER FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS; PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS; AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK. CASH WAS GENERATED AS A

RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS LARGELY AS A RESULT OF AN

INCREASE IN ACTIVITY LEVELS IN IB PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CIO REFLECTING REPOSITIONING

ACTIVITIES.

IN 2009, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $153.1 BILLION; THIS REFLECTED A DECLINE IN

WHOLESALE DEPOSITS, PREDOMINANTLY IN TSS, DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED NORMALIZATION OF WHOLESALE

DEPOSIT LEVELS RESULTING FROM THE MITIGATION OF CREDIT CONCERNS, COMPARED WITH THE HEIGHTENED

MARKET VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS IN THE LATTER PART OF 2008; A DECLINE IN OTHER BORROWINGS,

DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE TERM AUCTION FACILITY PROGRAM;

NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM ADVANCES FROM FHLBS AND THE MATURITY OF THE NONRECOURSE ADVANCES UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON AML FACILITY; THE JUNE 17, 2009, REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE $25.0

BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY; AND THE PAYMENT

OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. CASH WAS ALSO USED FOR THE NET PAYMENT OF

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, AS ISSUANCES OF FDIC-GUARANTEED

DEBT AND NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT IN BOTH THE U.S. AND EUROPEAN MARKETS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY

REPAYMENTS INCLUDING LONG-TERM ADVANCES FROM FHLBS. CASH PROCEEDS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN

SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE PRICING AND

TO FINANCING THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE FIRMS AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO; AND THE ISSUANCE OF $5.8

BILLION OF COMMON STOCK. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES IN THE OPEN MARKET OF COMMON STOCK OR THE

WARRANTS DURING 2009.

IN 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $247.0 BILLION DUE TO GROWTH IN WHOLESALE

DEPOSITS, IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST- AND NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS IN TSS (DRIVEN BY BOTH NEW AND

EXISTING CLIENTS, AND DUE TO THE DEPOSIT INFLOWS RELATED TO THE HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND CREDIT

CONCERNS AFFECTING THE GLOBAL MARKETS THAT BEGAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008), AS WELL AS

INCREASES IN AM AND CB (DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH); PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF

PREFERRED STOCK AND THE WARRANT TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM; ADDITIONAL

ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES; AN INCREASE IN

OTHER BORROWINGS DUE TO NONRECOURSE SECURED ADVANCES UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON AML

FACILITY TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS;

INCREASES IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN

CONNECTION WITH HIGHER CLIENT DEMAND FOR LIQUIDITY AND TO FINANCE GROWTH IN THE FIRMS AFS

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO; AND A NET INCREASE IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF NON-FDIC

GUARANTEED DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED PRIOR TO DECEMBER 4, 2008, AND

THE ISSUANCE OF $20.8 BILLION OF FDIC-GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008. THE FOURTH-QUARTER FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT ISSUANCE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MATURITIES OF

NON-FDIC GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND

TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES WAS USED PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND TO BUILD LIQUIDITY. CASH WAS ALSO USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE

ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING 2008.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE RATINGS

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY

COMMITMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN CREDIT RATINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE

ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES ON PAGE 95 AND RATINGS PROFILE OF

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM ON PAGE 124, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES 191199, RESPECTIVELY,

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS

STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT BANKING

DECEMBER 31, 2010, MOODYS AND S&PS OUTLOOK REMAINED NEGATIVE, WHILE FITCHS OUTLOOK REMAINED

STABLE.

FOLLOWING THE FIRMS EARNINGS RELEASE ON JANUARY 14, 2011, S&P AND MOODYS ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR

RATINGS ON THE FIRM REMAINED UNCHANGED.

IF THE FIRMS SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH, THE FIRM BELIEVES THE

INCREMENTAL COST OF FUNDS OR LOSS OF FUNDING WOULD BE MANAGEABLE, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RESOURCES. JPMORGAN CHASES

UNSECURED DEBT DOES NOT

CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR CHANGES IN THE

STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, PROVIDE ANY LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE BORROWINGS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL, BASED ON UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS,

OR STOCK PRICE.

SEVERAL RATING AGENCIES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL BE EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF THE FINANCIAL

REGULATORY REFORM LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE FIRMS

CREDIT RATINGS WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH REVIEWS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES

CREDIT (FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND DERIVATIVES) TO A

VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER.

LOANS ORIGINATED OR ACQUIRED BY THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVELY MONITORS THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT IT

IS WELL DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHY, RISK RATING, MATURITY AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENT

CATEGORIES. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT FOR WHOLESALE LOANS INCLUDES, FOR THE FIRMS SYNDICATED LOAN

BUSINESS, DISTRIBUTING ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKET PLACE, TARGETING EXPOSURE HELD IN THE RETAINED

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO AT LESS THAN 10% OF THE CUSTOMER FACILITY. WITH REGARD TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT

MARKET, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED FROM A PRODUCT, INDUSTRY AND

GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE BEING EMPLOYED FOR ALL HOME LENDING

PORTFOLIOS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE RATE REDUCTIONS, FORBEARANCE AND OTHER ACTIONS INTENDED TO

MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND AVOID FORECLOSURE. IN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE EITHER

RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO OR SECURITIZED AND SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S.

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF

BUSINESS. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LINE APPROVAL



ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE



MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES AND DELINQUENT LOANS



DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURES

ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER VERSUS WHOLESALE), RISK MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS

(E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND BORROWERS CREDIT SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK-RATING) AND RISK

MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED

WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR

THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH PROBABLE AND

UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS AS FOLLOWS.



PROBABLE LOSSES ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON STATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES AS A RESULT

OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF

RISK.



UNEXPECTED LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE

POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF LOSSES.

RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A RISK-RATED BASIS; FOR THE

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

RISK RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING

BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO REFLECT THE BORROWERS CURRENT FINANCIAL

POSITIONS, RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL. FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED, PROBABLE

AND UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS SEVERITY

GIVEN A DEFAULT. THESE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE GENERALLY HELD IN IB, CB, TSS AND AM; THEY ALSO

INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $18 BILLION OF CERTAIN BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS IN RFS THAT ARE

RISK-RATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL LOANS. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS

THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL NOT BE REPAID AND WILL DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS

CALCULATED FOR EACH CLIENT WHO HAS A RISK-RATED LOAN (WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN RISK-RATED CONSUMER LOANS). LOSS

GIVEN DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED

ON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW.

116

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED ON A

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES EXPECTED TO EMERGE OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME FOR EACH

PORTFOLIO. THE CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY, CERTAIN BUSINESS BANKING AND

AUTO LOANS, STUDENT LOANS, AS WELL AS CREDIT CARD LOANS. PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO

ARE ESTIMATED USING SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS,

WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY, GEOGRAPHY, LTV RATIOS AND CREDIT SCORES.

THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE SEVERITY OF

LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE LOSSES. OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS UTILIZED TO

EVALUATE PROBABLE LOSSES INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION

SOURCES, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, POTENTIAL BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THESE

FACTORS AND ANALYSES ARE UPDATED AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS MARKET

CONDITIONS DICTATE.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT AND TO ENSURE CREDIT

RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH

THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES,

CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR

MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURE.

FOR

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS, INCLUDING ANY CONCENTRATIONS AT THE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL, ARE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, AS CERTAIN OF THESE TRENDS CAN BE AMELIORATED

THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

EVALUATES DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS, CURRENT AND FORECASTED

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. ALL OF THESE HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED TRENDS ARE

INCORPORATED INTO THE MODELING OF ESTIMATED CONSUMER CREDIT LOSSES AND ARE PART OF THE MONITORING

OF THE CREDIT RISK PROFILE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY AT AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO, INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL

COUNTERPARTY BASIS WITH ESTABLISHED CONCENTRATION LIMITS THAT ARE REVIEWED AND REVISED, AS DEEMED

APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. INDUSTRY AND COUNTERPARTY LIMITS, AS MEASURED IN

TERMS OF EXPOSURE AND ECONOMIC CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, ARE SUBJECT TO

STRESS-BASED LOSS CONSTRAINTS FOR

THE AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING.



LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS



LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS



CREDIT DERIVATIVES



USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS



COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES

IN ADDITION TO RISK MANAGEMENT, THE FIRMS AUDIT DEPARTMENT PROVIDES PERIODIC REVIEWS, AS WELL AS

CONTINUOUS MONITORING, WHERE APPROPRIATE, OF THE FIRMS CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN RISK-RATED CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIOS, A CREDIT REVIEW GROUP

WITHIN THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.



INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING THE CHANGING RISK GRADES ASSIGNED TO EXPOSURES; AND



EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUSINESS UNITS RISK RATING, INCLUDING THE ACCURACY AND

CONSISTENCY OF RISK GRADES, THE TIMELINESS OF RISK GRADE CHANGES AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF RISK

GRADES IN CREDIT MEMORANDA

IN THE FIRMS CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO, THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT PERIODICALLY TESTS THE INTERNAL

CONTROLS AROUND THE MODELING PROCESS INCLUDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA UTILIZED. IN ADDITION, THE

RISK INHERENT IN THE FIRMS CONSUMER BASED LOANS IS EVALUATED USING MODELS WHOSE CONSTRUCTION,

ASSUMPTIONS AND ON-GOING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXPECTATIONS ARE REVIEWED BY AN INDEPENDENT RISK

MANAGEMENT GROUP THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE LINES OF BUSINESS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON CONSUMER

LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT QUALITY

FORECASTS, CONCENTRATION LEVELS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND

DISCUSSED WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL, SEE PAGE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2010 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

DURING 2010, THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED COMPARED WITH 2009, RESULTING IN DECREASED DOWNGRADE,

DEFAULT AND CHARGE-OFF ACTIVITY AND IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS. DESPITE CHALLENGING

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ACTIVELY

MANAGE ITS UNDERPERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS AND REDUCE SUCH EXPOSURES THROUGH REPAYMENTS, LOAN

SALES AND WORKOUTS. THESE EFFORTS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO

COMPARED WITH 2009 AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRMS REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

PARTICULARLY IN CS AND IB. DURING THE YEAR AND PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2010, CUSTOMER

DEMAND FOR CREDIT IMPROVED, LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITY AND MARKET LIQUIDITY IMPROVED AND CREDIT

SPREADS TIGHTENED FROM 2009.

IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, CRITICIZED ASSETS, NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED FROM

PEAK LOSS LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN 2009, REFLECTING GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE). TOWARD THE END OF 2010, CRE

EXPOSURE SHOWED SOME POSITIVE SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AS PROPERTY VALUES IMPROVED SOMEWHAT FROM THE

DECLINES WITNESSED OVER THE PRIOR TWO YEARS. THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO BE ACTIVELY

MANAGED, IN PART BY CONDUCTING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH REVIEWS OF CREDIT

QUALITY AND OF INDUSTRY, PRODUCT

AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS. UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING HAVE REMAINED IN

FOCUS, CONSISTENT WITH EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REFLECTING THE IMPROVEMENT

IN CREDIT QUALITY OF THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THE

WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO WAS 2.14%, COMPARED WITH 3.57% AT THE END OF 2009.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE WHOLESALE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND WHOLESALE LOANS, SEE WHOLESALE

CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES 120129 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CREDIT PERFORMANCE IMPROVED FROM 2009 WITH LOWER DELINQUENT LOANS,

NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND CHARGE-OFFS. HOWEVER, CREDIT PERFORMANCE CONTINUED TO BE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

CONTINUED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE NUMBER OF LOANS CHARGED OFF, WHILE CONTINUED WEAK

HOUSING PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN AN ELEVATED SEVERITY OF LOSS RECOGNIZED ON DEFAULTED REAL ESTATE

LOANS. THE FIRM HAS TAKEN PROACTIVE ACTION TO ASSIST HOMEOWNERS MOST IN NEED OF FINANCIAL

ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURYS MHA

PROGRAMS AND CONTINUING ITS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO

DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE U.S. TREASURYS PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FIRM

HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER LOANS BY TIGHTENING BOTH UNDERWRITING AND

LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS, AS WELL AS ELIMINATING CERTAIN PRODUCTS

AND LOAN ORIGINATION CHANNELS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND CONSUMER LOANS, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON

PAGES 129138 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009. TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE OF $1.8 TRILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DECREASED BY $46.9 BILLION FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2009, REFLECTING A DECREASE OF $83.8 BILLION IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, PARTLY OFFSET

BY AN INCREASE OF $36.9 BILLION IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. DURING 2010, LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS DECREASED BY $36.3 BILLION, LOANS DECREASED BY $25.2 BILLION AND RECEIVABLES FROM

CUSTOMERS INCREASED BY $16.8 BILLION. THE OVERALL DECREASE IN TOTAL LOANS WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO

REPAYMENTS, LOW CUSTOMER DEMAND AND LOAN SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES, PREDOMINANTLY IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO.

WHILE OVERALL PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE DECLINED, THE FIRM PROVIDED AND RAISED NEARLY $1.4 TRILLION IN NEW

AND RENEWED CREDIT AND CAPITAL FOR CONSUMERS, CORPORATIONS, SMALL BUSINESSES, MUNICIPALITIES AND

NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DURING 2010.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. UPON

THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER

LOAN SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, PRIMARILY MORTGAGE-RELATED. AS A RESULT, RELATED ASSETS ARE NOW

PRIMARILY RECORDED IN LOANS OR OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AS A RESULT OF

THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, REPORTED AND MANAGED BASIS ARE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, NONPERFORMING ASSETS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $10.5 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT ARE 90 DAYS

PAST DUE AND ACCRUING AT THE GUARANTEED REIMBURSEMENT RATE; (2) REAL ESTATE OWNED INSURED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $1.9 BILLION AND $579 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND (3) STUDENT LOANS

THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

UNDER THE FFELP, OF $625 MILLION AND $542 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED AS

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED AMOUNTS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS POLICY IS

GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY

REGULATORY GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(FFIEC). CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT

BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED

EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(I)

EXCLUDES PCI LOANS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE

COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS, THE PAST DUE STATUS OF THE

POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE FIRM IS

RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE ALL CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING.

(J)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE

RETAINED LOANS OF $698.2 BILLION; AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, AVERAGE RETAINED

LOANS OF $672.3 BILLION AND AVERAGE SECURITIZED LOANS OF $85.4 BILLION.

(K)

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, FIRMWIDE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS WERE

CALCULATED INCLUDING AVERAGE PCI LOANS OF $77.0 BILLION AND $85.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PCI LOANS, THE TOTAL FIRMS MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE

BEEN 3.81% AND 4.37% RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) INCREASED BY $36.9 BILLION

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF $23.5 BILLION IN

LOANS AND $16.8 BILLION OF RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY DECREASES IN INTERESTS IN

PURCHASE RECEIVABLES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OF $2.5 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND THE INCREASE IN LOANS WERE PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE JANUARY 1, 2010, ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES, WHICH RESULTED

IN THE ELIMINATION OF A NET $17.7 BILLION OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND

ITS

ADMINISTRATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS UPON CONSOLIDATION. ASSETS OF THE CONSOLIDATED CONDUITS

INCLUDED $15.1 BILLION OF WHOLESALE LOANS AT JANUARY 1, 2010. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND LOANS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $16.6 BILLION

AND $8.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY RELATED TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN LOANS

ALSO INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF A $3.5 BILLION LOAN PORTFOLIO IN

CB DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010. THE

INCREASE OF $16.8 BILLION IN RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS WAS DUE

TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY,

PREDOMINANTLY IN PRIME SERVICES.

RECEIVABLES MARKED TO MARKET ON PAGES 125126 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES REPRESENTING PRIMARILY MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE

CLIENTS OF $32.5 BILLION AND $15.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, ARE

INCLUDED IN THE TABLE. THESE MARGIN LOANS ARE GENERALLY OVER-COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF

ASSETS MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A

MAINTENANCE MARGIN CALL IS MADE TO THE

CLIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT PROVIDED

BY THE CLIENT, THE CLIENTS POSITIONS MAY BE LIQUIDATED BY THE FIRM TO MEET THE MINIMUM COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS.

WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE  SELECTED INDUSTRY EXPOSURES

THE FIRM FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR

ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. EXPOSURES DEEMED CRITICIZED

GENERALLY REPRESENT A RATINGS PROFILE SIMILAR TO A RATING OF CCC+/CAA1 AND LOWER, AS DEFINED BY

S&P AND MOODYS. THE TOTAL CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF THE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE, DECREASED TO $22.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, FROM $33.2 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES.

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT

EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIES THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT

CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE PRECEDING PAGE.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY

INCREASED BY 22% OR $11.8 BILLION,

AND CRITICIZED EXPOSURE DECREASED 71%, COMPARED WITH 2009. THIS PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT

IN CREDIT QUALITY AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN INVESTMENT-GRADE LENDING, AS WELL AS UPGRADES IN

RISK RATINGS TO FINANCIAL COUNTERPARTIES.



REAL ESTATE: REAL ESTATE LOANS DECREASED BY 6% OR $3.6 BILLION FROM 2009, INCLUDING A 19%

DECLINE IN THE CRITICIZED PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF REPAYMENTS AND LOANS

SALES. WHILE THIS SECTOR CONTINUED TO BE CHALLENGED THROUGHOUT 2010, THE PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCED

STABILIZATION TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR. THE RATIO OF NONACCRUAL LOANS TO TOTAL LOANS

INCREASED DUE TO A DOWNGRADE OF A LOAN TO NONACCRUAL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2010. EXCLUDING

THIS DOWNGRADE, THE RATIO WOULD HAVE IMPROVED IN LINE WITH THE BROADER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.



STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS: EXPOSURE TO THIS SEGMENT INCREASED BY $1.1 BILLION OR 3%

IN 2010 TO $35.8 BILLION. LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF EXPOSURE

TO THIS SECTOR, MAINLY BOND LIQUIDITY AND STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS. CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO REMAINS HIGH AS 97% OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE, UP

FROM 93% IN 2009. CRITICIZED EXPOSURE WAS LESS THAN 1% OF THIS INDUSTRYS EXPOSURE. THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MONITOR AND MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE IN LIGHT OF THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT

FACED BY STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF COMMITMENTS FOR BOND

LIQUIDITY AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, FROM

LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON

LOANS, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

RETAINED WHOLESALE LOANS WERE $222.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $200.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE $22.4 BILLION INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE JANUARY 1, 2010,

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, LOANS INCREASED BY $7.4 BILLION. LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

RELATE PRIMARILY TO SYNDICATED LOANS AND LOANS TRANSFERRED FROM THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE THROUGH SALES OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. DURING 2010 THE FIRM SOLD $7.7 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, RECOGNIZING REVENUE

GAINS OF $98.9 MILLION. IN 2009, THE FIRM SOLD $3.9 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, RECOGNIZING

NET LOSSES OF $38 MILLION. THESE RESULTS INCLUDED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF NONACCRUAL LOANS, IF

ANY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY. DERIVATIVES ENABLE CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM TO

MANAGE EXPOSURES TO

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, SEE NOTE 5

(A)

IN 2010, THE REPORTING OF CASH COLLATERAL NETTING WAS ENHANCED TO REFLECT A REFINED ALLOCATION BY

PRODUCT. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE REFINEMENT

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE

TO CREDIT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, OF $7.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WERE $80.5 BILLION AND $80.2

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THESE REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE (E.G. MTM) OF

THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, CASH

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA). THESE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT CURRENT

MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT

CREDIT RISK SHOULD ALSO REFLECT ADDITIONAL LIQUID SECURITIES AND OTHER CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE

FIRM OF $16.5 BILLION AND $15.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN

TOTAL EXPOSURE, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $64.0 BILLION AND $64.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS,

AS WELL AS COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY AND COLLATERAL THAT

THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THOUGH THIS

COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE BALANCES NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY

AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM HELD $18.0 BILLION AND $16.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF ALL

COLLATERAL, ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE),

AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. DRE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED

TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED

LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY

AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF

POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE

TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE

CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CVA, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AVG EXPOSURE WAS $45.3 BILLION AND $49.0

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET

OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $64.0 BILLION AND $64.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE

COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE

PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES

IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO

CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS CREDIT

APPROVAL PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRMS AVG TO A

COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT QUALITY. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE ACCOMPANYING GRAPH SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED

BY THE DRE AND AVG METRICS. THE TWO MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST

YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM USES COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

RISK IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS  EXCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE SPOT TRADES, WHICH ARE NOT TYPICALLY COVERED BY COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS DUE TO THEIR SHORT MATURITY  WAS 88% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM

89% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FIRM POSTED $58.3 BILLION AND $56.7 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AT DECEMBER

31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, THE FIRM IS PRIMARILY A PURCHASER OF CREDIT PROTECTION. AS A

PURCHASER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTY PROVIDING THE CREDIT

PROTECTION WILL DEFAULT. AS A SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING

INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT EVENT.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER

IN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS; AND SECOND, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE

FIRMS OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OVERALL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL

COMMERCIAL CREDIT LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS).

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THE FIRMS $80.5 BILLION OF TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $7.7 BILLION,

OR 10%, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE BENEFIT OF LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL.

ONE TYPE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH COUNTERPARTIES ARE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

(CDS). THE LARGE MAJORITY OF CDS ARE SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS TO PROTECT THE FIRM FROM

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE USE OF COLLATERAL TO SETTLE AGAINST DEFAULTING COUNTERPARTIES

GENERALLY PERFORMED AS

DESIGNED IN SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATING THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THESE

COUNTERPARTIES. IN 2010, THE FREQUENCY AND SIZE OF DEFAULTS RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING DEBT

REFERENCED IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES WAS LOWER THAN 2009. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES 191199

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS

WITHIN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS, THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY BUYING AND

SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, ACCORDING TO CLIENT DEMAND.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES 191199 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD DECREASED BY

$496.1 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INDUSTRY EFFORTS

TO REDUCE OFFSETTING TRADE ACTIVITY.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING

LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. THE FIRM ALSO MANAGES ITS

WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE BY PURCHASING PROTECTION THROUGH SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT

DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ON THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO OFFSET

CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ON THE LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OR DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THIS

ACTIVITY DOES NOT REDUCE THE REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR THE LEVEL OF REPORTED

OFFBALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS, ALTHOUGH IT DOES PROVIDE THE FIRM WITH CREDIT RISK PROTECTION. THE

FIRM ALSO DIVERSIFIES ITS EXPOSURES BY SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, WHICH INCREASES EXPOSURE TO

INDUSTRIES OR CLIENTS WHERE THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CLIENT-RELATED EXPOSURE; HOWEVER, THIS

ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, TO

MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN ON THESE

COMMITMENTS OR THE FIRM FULFILLS ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES

SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS.

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE $346.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH

$347.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECREASE REFLECTED THE JANUARY 1, 2010, ADOPTION OF

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE,

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $16.6 BILLION.

IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS

NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN

DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE COMMITMENTS,

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE

PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED ON AVERAGE

PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME DRAWN UPON IN AN EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE

LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE $189.9 BILLION AND $179.8

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRMS WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURES TO BOTH DEVELOPED AND EMERGING

MARKETS. THE FIRM SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY ITS COUNTRY EXPOSURES, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT-RELATED LENDING,

TRADING AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE UNDER THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH IS REPORTED BASED ON THE

COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS,

INCLUDING RESALE AGREEMENTS, ARE ADJUSTED FOR COLLATERAL AND FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G.,

GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES; OUTSTANDINGS SUPPORTED BY A GUARANTOR

LOCATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OR BACKED BY COLLATERAL HELD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE

COUNTRY OF THE ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES AND OTHER

SHORT CREDIT OR EQUITY TRADING POSITIONS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. TOTAL EXPOSURE MEASURES

INCLUDE ACTIVITY WITH BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY.

THE FIRM ALSO REPORTS COUNTRY EXPOSURE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES FOLLOWING FFIEC GUIDELINES, WHICH

ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR MEASURING COUNTRY EXPOSURE. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FFIEC EXPOSURES, SEE CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS ON PAGE 314 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING GREECE, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, ITALY AND IRELAND, HAVE BEEN SUBJECT

TO CREDIT DETERIORATION DUE TO WEAKNESSES IN THEIR ECONOMIC AND FISCAL SITUATIONS. THE FIRM IS

CLOSELY MONITORING ITS EXPOSURES TO THESE FIVE COUNTRIES. AGGREGATE NET EXPOSURES TO THESE FIVE

COUNTRIES AS MEASURED UNDER THE FIRMS INTERNAL APPROACH WAS LESS THAN $15.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2010, WITH NO COUNTRY REPRESENTING A MAJORITY OF THE EXPOSURE. SOVEREIGN EXPOSURE IN ALL FIVE

COUNTRIES REPRESENTED LESS THAN HALF THE AGGREGATE NET EXPOSURE. THE FIRM CURRENTLY BELIEVES ITS

EXPOSURE TO THESE FIVE COUNTRIES IS MODEST RELATIVE TO THE FIRMS OVERALL RISK EXPOSURES AND IS

MANAGEABLE GIVEN THE SIZE AND TYPES OF EXPOSURES TO EACH OF THE COUNTRIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION

OF THE AGGREGATE EXPOSURE. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AND SUPPORT CLIENT ACTIVITY IN

THESE COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, THE FIRMS AGGREGATE NET EXPOSURES MAY VARY OVER TIME. IN ADDITION,

THE NET EXPOSURES MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, AND THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST

RATES AND CREDIT SPREADS ON MARKET VALUATIONS.

AS PART OF ITS ONGOING COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, THE FIRM MONITORS EXPOSURE TO EMERGING

MARKET COUNTRIES, AND UTILIZES COUNTRY STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS

ASSOCIATED WITH A SOVEREIGN CRISIS. THERE IS NO COMMON DEFINITION OF EMERGING MARKETS, BUT THE FIRM

GENERALLY INCLUDES IN ITS DEFINITION THOSE COUNTRIES WHOSE SOVEREIGN DEBT RATINGS ARE EQUIVALENT TO

A+ OR LOWER. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ITS TOP 10 EMERGING MARKETS

COUNTRIES BASED ON ITS INTERNAL MEASUREMENT APPROACH. THE SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON

THE FIRMS LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY AND DOES NOT REPRESENT ITS VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR

POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME

EQUITY LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, AUTO LOANS, STUDENT LOANS AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS.

THE FIRMS

PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON SERVING THE PRIME CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE

CONSUMER LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CONSUMER LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE

IDENTIFIED AS PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RISK CHARACTERISTICS,

INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LTV RATIOS, FICO SCORES AND DELINQUENCY STATUS. THESE PCI LOANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS, AND THE POOLS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

PERFORMING. SEE PAGES 132134

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE PRODUCT SPECTRUM HAS STABILIZED

BUT HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE NUMBER

OF LOANS CHARGED OFF, AND WEAK HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SEVERITY OF LOSS

RECOGNIZED ON REAL ESTATE LOANS THAT DEFAULT. DELINQUENCIES AND NONACCRUAL LOANS REMAIN ELEVATED

BUT HAVE IMPROVED. THE DELINQUENCY TREND EXHIBITED IMPROVEMENT IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010;

EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (3089 DAYS DELINQUENT) THEN FLATTENED ACROSS MOST RFS PRODUCTS EARLY IN

THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, BEFORE ONCE AGAIN SHOWING IMPROVEMENT AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

LATE-STAGE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DELINQUENCIES (150+ DAYS DELINQUENT) REMAIN

ELEVATED. THE

ELEVATED LEVEL OF THESE CREDIT QUALITY METRICS IS DUE, IN PART, TO LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES

CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN AND ELONGATED FORECLOSURE PROCESSING TIMELINES. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE

LOANS CONTINUED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS STANDARD CHARGE-OFF PRACTICES, BUT

SOME DELINQUENT LOANS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN FORECLOSED UPON REMAIN IN THE MORTGAGE AND

HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

SINCE MID-2007, THE FIRM HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE TO CONSUMER LOANS BY TIGHTENING

BOTH UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS, AS WELL AS ELIMINATING CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND

LOAN ORIGINATION CHANNELS FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING. THE TIGHTENING OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA FOR AUTO

LOANS HAS RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF BOTH EXTENDED-TERM AND HIGH LTV FINANCING. IN ADDITION, NEW

ORIGINATIONS OF PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS ARE LIMITED TO SCHOOL-CERTIFIED LOANS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH

INCLUDE A QUALIFIED CO-BORROWER.

AS A FURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS

REDUCED OR CANCELED CERTAIN LINES OF CREDIT AS PERMITTED BY LAW. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAY REDUCE

OR CLOSE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING PROPERTY OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE

BORROWER. ALSO, THE FIRM TYPICALLY CLOSES CREDIT CARD LINES WHEN THE BORROWER IS 60 DAYS OR MORE

PAST DUE. FINALLY, CERTAIN INACTIVE CREDIT CARD LINES HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND A NUMBER OF ACTIVE

CREDIT CARD LINES HAVE BEEN REDUCED.

(F)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE INCLUDED PRIME MORTGAGES OF $154 MILLION

THE CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE,

THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT WOULD BE USED AT THE SAME TIME. FOR CREDIT CARD COMMITMENTS

AND HOME EQUITY COMMITMENTS (IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET), THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL

THESE LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE

AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

BEEN FULLY REPAID OR CHARGED OFF AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. SEE

SECURITIZATIONS, SEE CS ON PAGES 7981 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(K)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, NONACCRUAL LOANS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $10.5 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE

AND ACCRUING AT THE GUARANTEED REIMBURSEMENT RATE; AND (2) STUDENT LOANS THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST

DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER THE FFELP, OF $625

MILLION AND $542 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED AS REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED

AMOUNTS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT

CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER

GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FFIEC, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN

WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION

ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(L)

EXCLUDES PCI LOANS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A

SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS, THE PAST-DUE STATUS

OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE

FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE ALL CONSIDERED TO BE

PERFORMING.

(M)

AVERAGE CONSUMER LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE WERE $1.5 BILLION AND $2.2

BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS WERE

EXCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING NET CHARGE-OFF RATES.

(N)

AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, NET CHARGE-OFF RATES FOR 2010 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF AN AGGREGATE

$632 MILLION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE

COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE LOANS AT THE CHARGE-OFF DATE. ABSENT THIS ADJUSTMENT, NET CHARGE-OFF

RATES WOULD HAVE BEEN 0.92%, 4.57%, 1.73% AND 8.87% FOR HOME EQUITY

 SENIOR LIEN; HOME

EQUITY  JUNIOR LIEN; PRIME MORTGAGE (INCLUDING OPTION ARMS); AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE,

RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD AND PCI LOANS, AND TOTAL CONSUMER,

EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATES WOULD HAVE BEEN 2.76% AND 2.14%, RESPECTIVELY,

EXCLUDING THIS ADJUSTMENT.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. UPON

ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

SEPARATELY BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRMS CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, RELATED DELINQUENCY

INFORMATION AND OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

220238 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO CHARGE DOWN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT NO

LATER THAN 180 DAYS PAST DUE. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM RECORDED AN AGGREGATE

ADJUSTMENT OF $632 MILLION TO INCREASE NET CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE

VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING DELINQUENT RESIDENTIAL HOME LOANS. BECAUSE THESE LOSSES WERE

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, THIS ADJUSTMENT HAD NO IMPACT

ON THE FIRMS NET INCOME. THE IMPACT OF THIS AGGREGATE ADJUSTMENT ON REPORTED NET CHARGE-OFF RATES

IS PROVIDED IN FOOTNOTE (N) ABOVE.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE $88.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $101.4

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECREASE IN THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOAN PAYDOWNS AND

CHARGE-OFFS. JUNIOR LIEN NET CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR BUT REMAINED HIGH. SENIOR

LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT, WHILE JUNIOR LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS DECREASED FROM

PRIOR YEAR-END AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES.

IMPROVEMENTS IN

DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS SLOWED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND STABILIZED AT THESE

ELEVATED LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS, THE FIRM MONITORS CURRENT JUNIOR LIEN LOANS

WHERE THE BORROWER HAS A FIRST MORTGAGE LOAN WHICH IS EITHER

DELINQUENT OR HAS BEEN MODIFIED, AS

SUCH JUNIOR LIEN LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AT HIGHER RISK OF DELINQUENCY. THE PORTFOLIO CONTAINED

AN ESTIMATED $4 BILLION OF SUCH JUNIOR LIEN LOANS. THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE JUNIOR LIEN LOANS

WAS CONSIDERED IN ESTABLISHING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, INCLUDING PRIME AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE $86.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $88.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE

DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PORTFOLIO RUNOFF, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADDITION OF LOANS TO THE

BALANCE SHEET AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. NET

CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR BUT REMAINED ELEVATED.

PRIME MORTGAGES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, INCLUDING OPTION ARMS, WERE $74.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$75.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECREASE IN LOANS WAS DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON

DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADDITION OF LOANS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT DURING THE YEAR

BUT REMAINED AT ELEVATED LEVELS. LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES INCREASED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE

YEAR, THEN TRENDED LOWER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE FLATTENING TOWARD THE END OF 2010. NONACCRUAL

LOANS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT, BUT ALSO REMAINED ELEVATED AS A RESULT OF ONGOING MODIFICATION ACTIVITY

AND FORECLOSURE PROCESSING DELAYS. CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED YEAR OVER YEAR BUT REMAINED HIGH.

OPTION ARM

LOANS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, WERE $8.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

AND REPRESENTED 11% OF THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO. THESE ARE PRIMARILY LOANS WITH LOW LTV RATIOS

AND HIGH BORROWER FICOS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM EXPECTS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER LOSSES ON THIS PORTFOLIO

WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PCI OPTION ARM POOL. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010, APPROXIMATELY 8% OF

THE OPTION ARM BORROWERS WERE DELINQUENT, 4% WERE MAKING INTEREST-ONLY OR NEGATIVELY AMORTIZING

PAYMENTS, AND 88% WERE MAKING AMORTIZING PAYMENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL BORROWERS WITHIN THE

PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF PAYMENT SHOCK DUE TO FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST AS A LIMITED NUMBER OF

THESE LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNPAID INTEREST ADDED TO THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE DUE TO NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION OF OPTION ARMS WAS $24 MILLION AND $78

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE

FIRM ESTIMATES THE FOLLOWING BALANCES OF OPTION ARM LOANS WILL EXPERIENCE A RECAST THAT RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE: $72

MILLION IN 2011, $241 MILLION IN 2012 AND $784 MILLION IN 2013. THE FIRM DID NOT ORIGINATE OPTION

ARMS AND NEW ORIGINATIONS OF OPTION ARMS WERE DISCONTINUED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL PRIOR TO THE DATE

OF JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITION OF ITS BANKING OPERATIONS.

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE $11.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $12.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2009. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE ADDITION OF LOANS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES.

LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES REMAINED ELEVATED BUT CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER RATE DURING

THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHILE EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES STABILIZED AT AN ELEVATED LEVEL DURING

THIS PERIOD. NONACCRUAL LOANS IMPROVED LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN LATE-STAGE

DELINQUENCIES. CHARGE-OFFS REFLECTED MODEST IMPROVEMENT.

AUTO.

AUTO LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE $48.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $46.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2009. DELINQUENT AND NONACCRUAL LOANS HAVE DECREASED. IN ADDITION, NET CHARGE-OFFS HAVE

DECLINED 52% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. PROVISION EXPENSE DECREASED DUE TO FAVORABLE LOSS SEVERITY AS A

RESULT OF A STRONG USED-CAR MARKET NATIONWIDE AND REDUCED LOSS FREQUENCY DUE TO THE TIGHTENING OF

UNDERWRITING CRITERIA IN EARLIER PERIODS. THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF

PRIME QUALITY CREDITS.

BUSINESS

BANKING.

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE $16.8 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$17.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF RUN-OFF OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO AND CHARGE-OFFS ON DELINQUENT LOANS. THESE LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

LOANS WHICH ARE HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN GUARANTEES. NONACCRUAL LOANS

CONTINUED TO REMAIN ELEVATED. AFTER HAVING INCREASED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2010, NONACCRUAL

LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, DECLINED TO YEAR-END 2009 LEVELS.

STUDENT AND OTHER.

STUDENT AND OTHER LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE,

WERE $15.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $16.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. OTHER LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

OTHER SECURED AND UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS. DELINQUENCIES REFLECTED SOME STABILIZATION IN THE

SECOND HALF OF 2010, BUT REMAINED ELEVATED. CHARGE-OFFS DURING 2010 REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT WITH

2009 LEVELS REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF ELEVATED UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS.

PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

PCI LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WERE $72.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$81.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THIS PORTFOLIO REPRESENTS LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THAT FAIR VALUE

INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIVES OF THE

LOANS, AND THEREFORE NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

THE FIRM REGULARLY UPDATES THE AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED

FOR THESE LOANS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS WOULD TRIGGER THE

RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (E.G., DECREASED PRINCIPAL CREDIT LOSSES, THE NET BENEFIT OF MODIFICATIONS)

WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WITH ANY REMAINING INCREASE

IN THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY IN INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED

LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS.

DURING 2010, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED AS PART OF THE FIRMS REGULAR ASSESSMENT OF THE PCI POOLS THAT IT

WAS PROBABLE THAT HIGHER EXPECTED PRINCIPAL CREDIT LOSSES WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED AN AGGREGATE $3.4 BILLION IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO THE

HOME EQUITY, PRIME MORTGAGE, OPTION ARM AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PCI PORTFOLIOS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

IMPAIRMENT, THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HOME EQUITY, PRIME MORTGAGE, OPTION ARM

AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PCI PORTFOLIOS WAS $1.6 BILLION, $1.8 BILLION, $1.5 BILLION AND $98 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $1.1 BILLION AND

$491 MILLION FOR THE PRIME MORTGAGE AND OPTION ARM PCI PORTFOLIOS, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31,

2009.

APPROXIMATELY

39% OF THE OPTION ARM BORROWERS WERE DELINQUENT, 5% WERE MAKING INTEREST-ONLY OR

NEGATIVELY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS, AND 56% WERE MAKING AMORTIZING PAYMENTS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF

CURRENT BORROWERS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF PAYMENT

SHOCK DUE TO FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST; SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO

A FIXED RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN. THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNPAID INTEREST ADDED TO THE UNPAID

PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE OPTION ARM PCI POOL WAS $1.4 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FOLLOWING

BALANCES OF OPTION ARM PCI LOANS WILL EXPERIENCE A RECAST THAT RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE: $1.2 BILLION IN 2011, $2.7

BILLION IN 2012 AND $508 MILLION IN 2013.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF LIFETIME LOSS ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN BOTH THE

NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. PRINCIPAL CHARGE-OFFS WILL NOT BE

RECORDED ON THESE POOLS UNTIL THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN FULLY DEPLETED.

GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION AND CURRENT ESTIMATED LTVS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

(A)

REPRESENTS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN RELATED, EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED

IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE. THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF RESIDENTIAL

REAL ESTATE LOANS IS IN CALIFORNIA. EXCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

AND PCI LOANS, CALIFORNIA-BASED LOANS RETAINED REPRESENTED 24% OF TOTAL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

LOANS RETAINED AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH 25% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. OF THE TOTAL

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN PORTFOLIO RETAINED, EXCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PCI LOANS, $86.4 BILLION, OR 54%, WERE CONCENTRATED IN CALIFORNIA, NEW

YORK, ARIZONA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $95.9 BILLION, OR 54%, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LTV RATIO FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS RETAINED, EXCLUDING

MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PCI LOANS, WAS 83% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

COMPARED WITH 81% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. EXCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED

BY U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND PCI LOANS, 24% OF THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO HAD A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER

THAN 100%, AND 10% OF THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO HAD A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 125% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH 22% WITH A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%, AND 9%

WITH A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 125%, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECLINE IN HOME

PRICES HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COLLATERAL VALUE UNDERLYING THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE LOAN PORTFOLIO. IN GENERAL, THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS IS GREATER

THAN THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS IN WHICH THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. WHILE A

LARGE PORTION OF THE LOANS WITH CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS GREATER THAN 100% CONTINUE TO PAY AND

ARE CURRENT, THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF THESE BORROWERS TO PAY REMAINS UNCERTAIN.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO, AS WELL AS THE RATIO OF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE, FOR PCI LOANS. BECAUSE

SUCH LOANS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE RATIO OF THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE CURRENT

ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE WILL BE LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO, WHICH IS BASED ON

THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS DO NOT

REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES; AS SUCH, THE RESULTING RATIOS ARE

NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

ZERO FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGE, RESPECTIVELY, AND $1.5 BILLION AND $491 MILLION FOR OPTION ARMS,

RESPECTIVELY.

PCI LOANS IN THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA REPRESENTED 53% AND 10%,

RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL PCI LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH 54% AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LTV RATIOS WERE 118% AND 135% FOR CALIFORNIA AND

FLORIDA LOANS, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED WITH 114% AND 131%, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON HOUSING PRICES IN CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA HAVE CONTRIBUTED

NEGATIVELY TO BOTH THE CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LTV RATIO AND THE RATIO OF CARRYING VALUE TO

CURRENT COLLATERAL VALUE FOR LOANS IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO. FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO, 63% HAD A CURRENT

ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%, AND 31% OF THE PCI PORTFOLIO HAD A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV

RATIO GREATER THAN 125% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010; THIS COMPARED WITH 59% OF THE PCI PORTFOLIO WITH A

CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%, AND 28% WITH A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER

THAN 125%, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF PCI LOANS IS BELOW THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE LOANS AND,

ACCORDINGLY, THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON BORROWERS BEHAVIOR

AND ONGOING ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON HOMES WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY, AS

WELL AS ON THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE HOUSING. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.

FOR BOTH THE FIRMS ON-BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND LOANS SERVICED FOR

OTHERS, MORE THAN 1,038,000 MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO BORROWERS AND APPROXIMATELY

318,000 HAVE BEEN APPROVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2009. OF THESE, APPROXIMATELY 285,000 HAVE

ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. OF THE REMAINING 720,000 MODIFICATIONS,

34% ARE IN A TRIAL PERIOD OR STILL BEING REVIEWED FOR A MODIFICATION, WHILE 66% HAVE DROPPED OUT OF

THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINAL MODIFICATION.

THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURYS MHA PROGRAMS AND IS CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS OTHER

LOSS-MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE U.S.

TREASURYS PROGRAMS. THE MHA PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM (HAMP) AND

THE SECOND LIEN MODIFICATION PROGRAM (2MP); THESE PROGRAMS MANDATE STANDARD MODIFICATION TERMS

ACROSS THE INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO BORROWERS, SERVICERS AND INVESTORS WHO PARTICIPATE.

THE FIRM COMPLETED ITS FIRST PERMANENT MODIFICATIONS UNDER HAMP IN SEPTEMBER 2009. UNDER 2MP, WHICH

THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED IN MAY 2010, HOMEOWNERS ARE OFFERED A WAY TO MODIFY THEIR SECOND MORTGAGE TO

MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE WHEN THEIR FIRST MORTGAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED UNDER HAMP.

THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS FOR TROUBLED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HAMP

INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL MODIFICATION PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE GSES AND GINNIE MAE, AS WELL AS THE

FIRMS PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE SIMILAR CONCESSIONS TO THOSE OFFERED UNDER

HAMP BUT WITH EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS OFFERED MODIFICATION

PROGRAMS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO BORROWERS WITH HIGHER-RISK MORTGAGE PRODUCTS.

MHA, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS, GENERALLY PROVIDE VARIOUS CONCESSIONS TO

FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BORROWERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM OR

PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, AND DEFERRAL OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN REQUIRED

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT. FOR THE 54,500 ONBALANCE SHEET LOANS MODIFIED UNDER

HAMP AND THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS SINCE JULY 1, 2009, 55% OF PERMANENT

LOAN MODIFICATIONS HAVE INCLUDED INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, 49% HAVE INCLUDED TERM OR PAYMENT

EXTENSIONS, 9% HAVE INCLUDED PRINCIPAL DEFERMENT AND 22% HAVE INCLUDED PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS.

PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC MODIFICATION PROGRAM FOR OPTION ARMS. THE SUM

OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THE TYPES OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS EXCEEDS 100% BECAUSE, IN SOME CASES, THE

MODIFICATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL LOAN INCLUDES MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF CONCESSION.

GENERALLY, BORROWERS MUST MAKE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS UNDER THE REVISED CONTRACTUAL TERMS DURING A

TRIAL MODIFICATION AND BE SUCCESSFULLY RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE A MORTGAGE

OR HOME EQUITY LOAN CAN BE PERMANENTLY MODIFIED. WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF

CREDIT, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS

OF THE MODIFICATION.

THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THESE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON REDUCING CREDIT LOSSES

REMAINS UNCERTAIN GIVEN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SINCE MODIFICATION. THE PRIMARY INDICATOR USED BY

MANAGEMENT TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MODIFIED LOANS

REDEFAULT. MODIFICATION REDEFAULT RATES ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF

LOAN MODIFIED, THE BORROWERS OVERALL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY THE MODIFIED LOAN AND OTHER

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. REDUCTION IN PAYMENT SIZE FOR A BORROWER HAS SHOWN TO BE THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT DRIVER IN IMPROVING REDEFAULT RATES. MODIFICATIONS COMPLETED AFTER JULY 1, 2009,

WHETHER UNDER HAMP OR UNDER THE FIRMS OTHER MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, DIFFER FROM MODIFICATIONS

COMPLETED UNDER PRIOR PROGRAMS IN THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY FULLY UNDERWRITTEN AFTER A

SUCH LOANS PERFORM SUBSEQUENT TO MODIFICATION THEY ARE GENERALLY SOLD BACK INTO GINNIE MAE

LOAN POOLS. MODIFIED LOANS THAT DO NOT RE-PERFORM BECOME SUBJECT TO FORECLOSURE. SUBSTANTIALLY

RESPECTIVELY, ARE TDRS FOR WHICH THE BORROWERS HAVE NOT YET MADE SIX PAYMENTS UNDER THEIR MODIFIED TERMS.

FORECLOSURE PREVENTION.

FORECLOSURE IS A LAST RESORT AND THE FIRM MAKES SIGNIFICANT

EFFORTS TO HELP BORROWERS STAY IN THEIR HOMES. SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THE FIRM HAS

PREVENTED TWO FORECLOSURES (THROUGH LOAN MODIFICATION, SHORT SALES, AND OTHER FORECLOSURE

PREVENTION MEANS) FOR EVERY FORECLOSURE COMPLETED.

THE FIRM HAS A WELL-DEFINED FORECLOSURE PREVENTION PROCESS WHEN A BORROWER FAILS TO PAY ON HIS OR

HER LOAN. CUSTOMER CONTACTS ARE ATTEMPTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN VARIOUS WAYS TO PURSUE OPTIONS OTHER

THAN FORECLOSURE (INCLUDING THROUGH LOAN MODIFICATION, SHORT SALES, AND OTHER FORECLOSURE

PREVENTION MEANS). IN ADDITION, IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTACT A CUSTOMER, VARIOUS REVIEWS ARE

COMPLETED OF BORROWERS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE A FORECLOSURE SALE IS COMPLETED. BY THE TIME

OF A FORECLOSURE SALE, BORROWERS HAVE NOT MADE A PAYMENT ON AVERAGE FOR APPROXIMATELY 14 MONTHS.

FORECLOSURE PROCESS ISSUES

THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS IS GOVERNED BY LAWS AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED ON A STATE-BY-STATE BASIS.

IN SOME STATES, THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS INVOLVES A JUDICIAL PROCESS REQUIRING FILING DOCUMENTS WITH

A COURT. IN OTHER STATES, THE PROCESS IS MOSTLY NON-JUDICIAL, INVOLVING VARIOUS PROCESSES, SOME OF

WHICH REQUIRE FILING DOCUMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM

BECAME AWARE THAT CERTAIN DOCUMENTS EXECUTED BY FIRM PERSONNEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS MAY NOT HAVE COMPLIED WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, THE UNDERLYING LOAN FILE REVIEW AND VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION FOR INCLUSION IN AN

AFFIDAVIT WAS PERFORMED BY FIRM PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THE AFFIANT, OR THE AFFIDAVIT MAY NOT HAVE

BEEN PROPERLY NOTARIZED. THE FIRM INSTRUCTED ITS OUTSIDE FORECLOSURE COUNSEL TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND

FORECLOSURES, FORECLOSURE SALES AND EVICTIONS IN 43 STATES SO THAT IT COULD REVIEW ITS PROCESSES.

THESE MATTERS ARE THE SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATION BY FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION, SEE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE INVESTIGATIONS AND

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

AS A RESULT OF THESE FORECLOSURE PROCESS ISSUES, THE FIRM HAS UNDERTAKEN REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO ENSURE

THAT IT SATISFIES ALL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES. THESE ACTIONS

INCLUDE.



A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE FORECLOSURE DOCUMENT EXECUTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES;



THE CREATION OF MODEL AFFIDAVITS THAT WILL COMPLY WITH ALL LOCAL LAW REQUIREMENTS AND BE

USED IN EVERY CASE;



IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES WHO EXECUTE

AFFIDAVITS PERSONALLY VERIFY THEIR CONTENTS AND THAT THE AFFIDAVITS ARE EXECUTED ONLY IN THE

PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF A LICENSED NOTARY;



EXTENSIVE TRAINING FOR ALL PERSONNEL WHO WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOCUMENT EXECUTION

GOING FORWARD AND CERTIFICATION OF THOSE PERSONNEL BY OUTSIDE COUNSEL;



IMPLEMENTATION OF A RIGOROUS QUALITY CONTROL DOUBLE-CHECK REVIEW OF AFFIDAVITS COMPLETED BY

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES; AND



REVIEW AND VERIFICATION OF OUR REVISED PROCEDURES BY OUTSIDE EXPERTS.

AS OF JANUARY 2011, THE FIRM HAS RESUMED INITIATION OF NEW

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS IN NEARLY ALL STATES IN WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, ABOUT THE FIRMS NONPERFORMING CONSUMER ASSETS, EXCLUDING

(A)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, NONPERFORMING ASSETS EXCLUDED: (1) MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED

BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $10.5 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT ARE 90 DAYS

PAST DUE AND ACCRUING AT THE GUARANTEED REIMBURSEMENT RATE; (2) REAL ESTATE OWNED INSURED BY

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OF $1.9 BILLION AND $579 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY; AND (3) STUDENT LOANS

THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

UNDER THE FFELP, OF $625 MILLION AND $542 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE EXCLUDED AS

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED AMOUNTS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

(B)

EXCLUDES PCI LOANS THAT WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS. SINCE EACH POOL IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A

SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS, THE PAST-DUE STATUS

OF THE POOLS, OR THAT OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS WITHIN THE POOLS, IS NOT MEANINGFUL. BECAUSE THE

FIRM IS RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON EACH POOL OF LOANS, THEY ARE ALL CONSIDERED TO BE

PERFORMING.

NONACCRUAL LOANS.

TOTAL CONSUMER NONACCRUAL LOANS, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, WERE $8.8

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $10.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. NONACCRUAL LOANS HAVE STABILIZED, BUT

REMAINED AT ELEVATED LEVELS. THE INCREASE IN LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE

TO RESULT IN ELEVATED LEVELS OF NONACCRUAL LOANS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS AS A

RESULT OF BOTH REDEFAULT OF MODIFIED LOANS AS WELL AS THE FIRMS POLICY THAT MODIFIED LOANS REMAIN

IN NONACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THE BORROWER HAS MADE A MINIMUM OF

SIX PAYMENTS UNDER THE NEW TERMS. NONACCRUAL LOANS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TOTALED

$7.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OF WHICH 71% WERE GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE; THIS COMPARED

WITH NONACCRUAL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS OF $9.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OF WHICH 64%

WERE GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE. MODIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS OF $1.3 BILLION AND

$920 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL LOANS. OF

THESE MODIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, $580 MILLION AND $256 MILLION HAD YET TO MAKE SIX

PAYMENTS UNDER THEIR MODIFIED TERMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE REMAINING

NONACCRUAL MODIFIED LOANS HAVING REDEFAULTED. IN THE AGGREGATE, THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE WAS CHARGED DOWN BY APPROXIMATELY 46%

AND 36% TO ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

REAL ESTATE OWNED (REO).

AS PART OF THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, LOANS ARE

WRITTEN DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE ASSET, LESS COSTS TO SELL, AT

ACQUISITION. TYPICALLY, ANY FURTHER GAINS OR LOSSES ON REO ASSETS ARE RECORDED AS PART OF OTHER

INCOME. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM GAINS OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES

AT THE COMPLETION OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, THESE REO ASSETS ARE MANAGED FOR PROMPT SALE AND

DISPOSITION AT THE BEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC VALUE. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH AS

REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE. REO ASSETS, EXCLUDING THOSE

INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCREASED BY $138 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009 TO $1.3

BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FORECLOSURES OF NON-PCI LOANS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT REO ASSETS WILL

CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS, AS LOANS MOVING THROUGH THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT CARD

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES (WHICH INCLUDE RECEIVABLES IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE NOT REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2010) WERE $137.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, A DECREASE OF $25.7 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009,

DUE TO THE DECLINE IN LOWER-YIELDING PROMOTIONAL BALANCES AND RUNOFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

PORTFOLIO.

THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE DECREASED TO 4.07% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, FROM 6.28% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, WHILE THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE INCREASED TO 9.73% FOR 2010, FROM 9.33% IN 2009 DUE PRIMARILY

TO THE DECLINE IN OUTSTANDING LOANS. THE DELINQUENCY TREND IS SHOWING IMPROVEMENT, ESPECIALLY

WITHIN EARLY STAGE DELINQUENCIES. CHARGE-OFFS WERE ELEVATED IN 2010 BUT SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS A RESULT OF LOWER DELINQUENT LOANS AND HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES. THE

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A WELL-SEASONED, LARGELY REWARDS-BASED PORTFOLIO THAT

HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. THE GREATEST GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT CARD

LOANS IS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH REPRESENTED 13% OF TOTAL LOANS AT DECEMBER 2010, COMPARED WITH 14% AT

DECEMBER 2009. LOAN CONCENTRATION FOR THE TOP FIVE STATES OF CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, TEXAS, FLORIDA

AND ILLINOIS CONSISTED OF $55.1 BILLION IN RECEIVABLES, OR 40% OF THE

PORTFOLIO, AT DECEMBER 2010,

COMPARED WITH $65.9 BILLION, OR 40%, AT DECEMBER 2009.

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO, WERE $123.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2010, COMPARED WITH $143.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE, EXCLUDING

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO, WAS 3.66% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DOWN FROM 5.52% AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, WHILE THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE INCREASED TO 8.72% IN 2010 FROM 8.45% IN 2009 DUE LARGELY TO

THE DECREASE IN OUTSTANDING LOANS.

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO WERE $13.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

COMPARED WITH $19.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIOS 30-DAY

DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 7.74% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DOWN FROM 12.72% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009; THE 2009

DELINQUENCY RATE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST

(WMMT) IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE IN 2010 WAS 18.73%, COMPARED WITH

18.79% IN 2009, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THE WMMT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009.

MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT CARD LOANS

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT CARD LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD

LOAN MODIFICATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY OFFER ONE OF A NUMBER OF LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO BORROWERS WHO ARE

EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. THE FIRM HAS SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO MAY BE IN

NEED OF TEMPORARY RELIEF, AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A MORE

FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MOST OF THE FIRMS MODIFIED CREDIT CARD

LOANS HAVE

BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THE FIRMS LONG-TERM PROGRAMS. MODIFICATIONS UNDER THE FIRMS LONG-TERM

PROGRAMS INVOLVE PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS.

MODIFICATIONS UNDER ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CARD.

ALSO, IN ALL CASES, THE FIRM CANCELS THE CUSTOMERS AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT ON THE CREDIT CARD.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE MODIFICATIONS, BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE TDRS.

BASED ON THE FIRMS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

BORROWERS WILL NOT ULTIMATELY COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2010 ANNUAL REPORT

137

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN

AGREEMENT GENERALLY REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT RATE TERMS. ASSUMING THAT THOSE

BORROWERS DO NOT BEGIN TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PAYMENT TERMS, THE LOANS CONTINUE TO AGE

AND WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHARGED OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. IN

ADDITION, IF A BORROWER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THEN THE LOAN

REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES THE FIRM DOES NOT

REINSTATE THE BORROWERS LINE OF CREDIT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM HAD $10.0 BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

ONBALANCE SHEET CREDIT CARD LOANS OUTSTANDING THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS.

THESE BALANCES INCLUDE BOTH CREDIT CARD LOANS WITH MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS AND

CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAVE REVERTED BACK TO THEIR PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. THE INCREASE IN

MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS OUTSTANDING FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, IS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO PREVIOUSLY-MODIFIED LOANS HELD IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

BEING CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF

VIES.

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS POLICY, ALL CREDIT CARD LOANS TYPICALLY REMAIN ON ACCRUAL STATUS.

HOWEVER, THE FIRM SEPARATELY ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF

BILLED AND ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME ON CREDIT CARD LOANS.

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT EXPOSURE

THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA) ENCOURAGES BANKS TO MEET THE CREDIT NEEDS OF

BORROWERS IN ALL SEGMENTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING NEIGHBORHOODS WITH LOW OR MODERATE

INCOMES. JPMORGAN CHASE IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BY PROVIDING LOANS,

INVESTMENTS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRMS CRA LOAN PORTFOLIO WAS APPROXIMATELY $16 BILLION AND $18 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE CRA PORTFOLIO 65% WERE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND 15% WERE

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY; 9% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS; AND 11% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OTHER LOANS. THE CRA

NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE 6% OF THE FIRMS NONACCRUAL LOANS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. NET

CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CRA PORTFOLIO WERE 3% OF THE FIRMS NET CHARGE-OFFS IN BOTH 2010 AND 2009.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED), AND

CONSUMER (PRIMARILY SCORED) PORTFOLIOS. THE ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE

CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINES AN ALLOWANCE FOR

WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY

SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOANS. DURING 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES USED TO ESTABLISH ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 149154 AND NOTE

15 ON PAGES 239243 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES INHERENT IN

THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $33.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AN INCREASE OF $442 MILLION

FROM $32.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES, THE FIRM ESTABLISHED AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $7.5 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2010,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RECEIVABLES THAT HAD BEEN HELD IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS.

EXCLUDING THE $7.5 BILLION TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT AT ADOPTION, THE ALLOWANCE DECREASED BY $6.8 BILLION IN THE

CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS, GENERALLY REFLECTING AN IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY.

THE CONSUMER (EXCLUDING

CREDIT CARD) ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED $1.6 BILLION LARGELY DUE TO A $3.4 BILLION

INCREASE RELATED TO FURTHER ESTIMATED DETERIORATION IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PCI POOLS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $1.8 BILLION REDUCTION PREDOMINANTLY IN NON-CREDIT-IMPAIRED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

RESERVES REFLECTING IMPROVED LOSS OUTLOOK AS A RESULT OF THE RESUMPTION OF FAVORABLE DELINQUENCY

TRENDS AT THE END OF 2010, AS WELL AS A $632 MILLION ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING DELINQUENT RESIDENTIAL HOME LOANS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, REFER TO PAGE 131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, LARGELY

DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT

OF THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT AT ADOPTION, THE CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE DECREASED BY $6.0 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009,

REFLECTING LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AS WELL AS LOWER

LEVELS OF OUTSTANDINGS.

THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED BY $2.4 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, PRIMARILY

DUE TO REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES, AS WELL AS CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS FOR BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT

CARD), WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS $717 MILLION AND $939 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE WHOLESALE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO.

THE CREDIT RATIOS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE BASED ON RETAINED LOAN BALANCES, WHICH EXCLUDE LOANS

HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. UPON THE

ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS, ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOAN

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, PRIMARILY MORTGAGE-RELATED. AS A RESULT $7.4 BILLION, $14 MILLION AND

$127 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WERE RECORDED

ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE ENTITIES.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(B)

OTHER PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDES A RECLASSIFICATION IN 2009 RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE AND RETENTION

OF SECURITIES FROM THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST.

(C)

INCLUDES RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

MODIFIED IN A TDR.

(D)

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES TDR

RESERVES OF $985 MILLION AND $754 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

PERIOD PRESENTATION.

(E)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON CREDIT CARD LOANS FOR WHICH THE

FIRM HAS MODIFIED THE TERMS OF THE LOANS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTY WAS RECLASSIFIED TO THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN REVISED

TO REFLECT THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(F)

THE FIRMS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL

STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE. UNDER THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FFIEC, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED

OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS

FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER),

WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

(G)

CHARGE-OFFS ARE NOT RECORDED ON PCI LOANS UNTIL ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED ESTIMATED LOSSES

RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.

(H)

EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF PCI LOANS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ON PCI LOANS WAS $4.9 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A CREDIT RATIO EXCLUDING: HOME LENDING PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION; AND CREDIT CARD LOANS HELD BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST

WHICH WERE CONSOLIDATED ONTO THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2009. THE PCI LOANS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, WHICH INCORPORATED

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE, AS OF THAT DATE, OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

ACCORDINGLY, NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE.

SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF

ESTIMATED CREDIT DETERIORATION IN THIS PORTFOLIO RESULTED IN THE

INCLUDING $1.6 BILLION FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO.

THE TOTAL CREDIT CARD PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$8.0 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $6.0 BILLION

AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND REDUCED NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE PRIOR YEAR MANAGED

PROVISION WAS $18.5 BILLION REFLECTING ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE OF $2.4 BILLION. THE WHOLESALE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $850 MILLION, COMPARED WITH EXPENSE OF $4.0 BILLION,

REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES PREDOMINANTLY AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED

IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO, REDUCED NET

CHARGE-OFFS AND REPAYMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND TO DEFINE MARKET

RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK

OFFICER.

MARKET RISK SEEKS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING

PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF LINE-OF-BUSINESS MARKET RISK



DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS



PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF

MARKET RISKS WITHIN ITS UNITS. THE FIRMS MARKET RISKS ARISE PRIMARILY FROM THE ACTIVITIES IN IB,

MORTGAGE BANKING, AND CIO IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY.

IB MAKES MARKETS AND TRADES ITS PRODUCTS ACROSS THE FIXED INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND

COMMODITIES MARKETS. THIS TRADING ACTIVITY MAY LEAD TO A POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME DUE TO

ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IN ADDITION TO THESE TRADING RISKS, THERE ARE RISKS IN IBS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO FROM RETAINED LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, HEDGES OF

THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND MARK-TO-MARKET HEDGES OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO.

ADDITIONAL RISK POSITIONS RESULT FROM THE DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED

LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS INCLUDES THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS,

MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES. THESE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS WELL AS

OPTION AND BASIS RISK. OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES

AND CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY

ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS

RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE RATE INDICES UNDERLYING MORTGAGE

EXPOSURE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

CIO IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH MANAGING STRUCTURAL RISKS WHICH ARISE OUT OF THE VARIOUS BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM. MARKET RISK MEASURES AND MONITORS THE GROSS STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES AS WELL AS

THE NET EXPOSURES RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS

METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)



ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



LOSS ADVISORIES



REVENUE DRAWDOWNS



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLES)



EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES VAR, A STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM

ADVERSE MARKET MOVES. EACH BUSINESS DAY, AS PART OF ITS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM

UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES THE MAJORITY OF ITS MATERIAL MARKET RISKS.

VAR PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION AND

IS USED FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES AND MONITORING LIMITS. THESE VAR RESULTS ARE REPORTED

TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORS, AND THEY FEED REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS.

THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR TO ESTIMATE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES FOR CURRENT POSITIONS USING

HISTORICAL DATA FROM THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. THIS APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL

CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF CURRENT RISK; THIS ASSUMPTION MAY NOT ALWAYS

BE VALID. VAR IS CALCULATED USING A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS

METHODOLOGY, WHICH APPROXIMATES A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO

INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES FIVE TIMES IN EVERY 100 TRADING

DAYS, OR ABOUT 12 TO 13 TIMES A YEAR.

VAR MEASUREMENT

IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR INCLUDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING ACTIVITIES IN IB, INCLUDING

THE CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE PRODUCTS AND SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT

THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE. THE FIRM USES PROXIES TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE PRODUCTS SINCE

DAILY TIME SERIES ARE LARGELY NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS LIKELY THAT USING AN ACTUAL PRICE-BASED TIME

SERIES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD AFFECT THE VAR RESULTS PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, FOR

CERTAIN PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR, PARTICULAR RISK PARAMETERS ARE

NOT FULLY CAPTURED  FOR EXAMPLE, CORRELATION RISK.

TOTAL OTHER VAR INCLUDES CERTAIN POSITIONS EMPLOYED AS PART OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION

WITHIN CIO AND IN THE MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS. CIO VAR INCLUDES POSITIONS, PRIMARILY IN DEBT

SECURITIES AND CREDIT PRODUCTS, USED TO MANAGE STRUCTURAL AND OTHER RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE,

CREDIT AND MORTGAGE RISKS ARISING FROM THE FIRMS ONGOING

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE MORTGAGE BANKING VAR INCLUDES THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE

LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES.

IN THE FIRMS VIEW, INCLUDING IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR WITHIN TOTAL OTHER VAR PRODUCES A

MORE COMPLETE AND TRANSPARENT PERSPECTIVE OF THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE.

IB AND OTHER VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RETAINED CREDIT PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS NOT MARKED TO MARKET;

HOWEVER, IT DOES INCLUDE HEDGES OF THOSE

POSITIONS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE DEBIT VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

THE FIRM, PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS (MEZZANINE FINANCING, TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS, ETC.), AND CERTAIN

SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY CIO. THESE

LONGER-TERM POSITIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE FIRMS EARNINGS AT RISK AND OTHER CASH FLOW

MONITORING PROCESSES, RATHER THAN BY USING A VAR MEASURE. PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND

PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS ARE MANAGED USING STRESS AND SCENARIO ANALYSES. SEE THE DVA SENSITIVITY

TABLE ON PAGE 144 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DETAILS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CORPORATE/PRIVATE

EQUITY, SEE PAGES 8990 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2010 AND 2009 VAR RESULTS

AS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE, AVERAGE TOTAL IB AND OTHER VAR TOTALED $99 MILLION FOR 2010, COMPARED

WITH $206 MILLION FOR 2009. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE VAR IN 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN MARKET

VOLATILITY IN EARLY 2009, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN CIO AND IB. AVERAGE

TOTAL IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR FOR 2010 WAS $87 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $164 MILLION FOR

2009. THE DECREASE IN IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR FOR 2010 WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE

IN MARKET VOLATILITY, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN EXPOSURE, PRIMARILY IN THE FIXED INCOME RISK

COMPONENT. CIO VAR AVERAGED $61 MILLION FOR 2010, COMPARED WITH $103 MILLION FOR 2009. MORTGAGE

BANKING VAR AVERAGED $23 MILLION FOR 2010,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

COMPARED WITH $57 MILLION FOR 2009. DECREASES IN CIO AND

MORTGAGE BANKING VAR FOR 2010 WERE AGAIN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN MARKET VOLATILITY AND POSITION

CHANGES. THE DECLINE IN MORTGAGE BANKING VAR AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS DECISION

TO REDUCE RISK GIVEN MARKET VOLATILITY AT THE TIME.

THE FIRMS AVERAGE IB AND OTHER VAR DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT WAS $59 MILLION OR 37% OF THE SUM FOR

2010, COMPARED WITH $82 MILLION OR 28% OF THE SUM FOR 2009. THE FIRM EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT IN 2010 AS POSITIONS CHANGED AND CORRELATIONS DECREASED. IN GENERAL, OVER

THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY

FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

VAR BACK-TESTING

THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST ITS MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS

DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF: PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR IB AND CIO (LESS PRIVATE

EQUITY GAINS/LOSSES AND REVENUE FROM LONGER-TERM CIO INVESTMENTS); TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST

INCOME FOR IB, CIO AND MORTGAGE BANKING; IB BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER

REVENUE; REVENUE FROM SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE; AND

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME FOR THE FIRMS MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS, AND

ALL RELATED HEDGES. DAILY FIRMWIDE MARKET RISKRELATED REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DVA.

THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISKRELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR IB,

CIO AND MORTGAGE BANKING POSITIONS FOR 2010. THE CHART SHOWS THAT THE FIRM POSTED MARKET

RISKRELATED GAINS ON 248 OUT OF 261 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH 12 DAYS EXCEEDING $210 MILLION. THE

INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH THE FIRM EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY

WHICH THE 95% CONFIDENCE-LEVEL VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. DURING 2010,

LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 13 DAYS, NONE OF WHICH EXCEEDED THE VAR MEASURE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROSS SENSITIVITY OF DVA TO A

ONE-BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREADS. THIS SENSITIVITY REPRESENTS THE IMPACT

FROM A ONE-BASIS-POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN JPMORGAN CHASES ENTIRE CREDIT CURVE. AS CREDIT CURVES DO

NOT TYPICALLY MOVE IN A PARALLEL FASHION, THE SENSITIVITY MULTIPLIED BY THE CHANGE IN SPREADS AT A

SINGLE MATURITY POINT MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKETS USING RECENT HISTORICAL

MARKET BEHAVIOR AS AN INDICATOR OF LOSSES, STRESS TESTING CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY

BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

IN CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES OR COMMODITY PRICES. SCENARIOS

ARE UPDATED DYNAMICALLY AND MAY BE REDEFINED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS. ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK; IT

ENHANCES UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AS STRESS LOSSES ARE

MONITORED AGAINST LIMITS. STRESS TESTING IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT.

STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RISK POSITIONS ARE REPORTED TO

THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EVENT

RISKSENSITIVE POSITIONS AND MANAGE RISKS WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES AS WELL AS STRESS TESTING INCLUDE SENSITIVITIES TO VARIABLES USED

TO VALUE POSITIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES, INTEREST RATE BASIS POINT VALUES AND

MARKET VALUES. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY

ARE AGGREGATED BY LINE-OF-BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR TACTICAL CONTROL AND

MONITORING LIMITS.

LOSS ADVISORIES AND REVENUE DRAWDOWNS

LOSS ADVISORIES AND NET REVENUE DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE

CERTAIN LEVELS OF RISK TOLERANCE. NET REVENUE DRAWDOWN IS DEFINED AS THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE

SINCE THE YEAR-TO-DATE PEAK REVENUE LEVEL.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS IN IB ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES

THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN TAX LEGISLATION, OR A

PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF UNUSUAL MARKET MOVES. THIS INFORMATION IS AGGREGATED CENTRALLY FOR IB.

TRADING BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIFLES, THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER

EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT. INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE

NONTRADING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING ACCRUAL LOANS

WITHIN IB AND CIO) RESULTS FROM ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET POSITIONS. ALCO ESTABLISHES THE FIRMS

INTEREST RATE RISK POLICIES, SETS RISK GUIDELINES AND LIMITS AND REVIEWS THE RISK PROFILE OF THE

FIRM. TREASURY, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, CALCULATES THE FIRMS INTEREST

RATE RISK PROFILE WEEKLY AND REPORTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

INTEREST RATE RISK FOR NONTRADING ACTIVITIES CAN OCCUR DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.



DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING

OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFFBALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. FOR

EXAMPLE, IF LIABILITIES REPRICE MORE

QUICKLY THAN ASSETS AND FUNDING INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFFBALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS THAT

ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE DEPOSIT LIABILITIES ARE REPRICING THAN

ASSETS WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE

(FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE) BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO

LEND AT LONG-TERM FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED ON THESE

SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED

INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON ITS LIABILITIES (E.G., DEPOSITS) WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING

INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ITS ASSETS (E.G., LOANS). CONVERSELY, HIGHER LONG-TERM

RATES RECEIVED ON ASSETS GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE

IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON LIABILITIES.



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFFBALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE BORROWERS THAN FORECASTED PAY DOWN

HIGHER-RATE LOAN BALANCES WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS MAY DECREASE

INITIALLY.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED,

CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A

TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN

BE RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND

CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT

EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR REPRICING, AND ANY

INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE

DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES

UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN

THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME, AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE FIRMS PRETAX EARNINGS, OVER

THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. THESE TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS

THE RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY

AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES

AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR. MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES COMPARED WITH UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL RATES, THE

TIME SINCE ORIGINATION, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND FORWARD MARKET EXPECTATIONS. THE BALANCE AND PRICING ASSUMPTIONS OF DEPOSITS THAT

HAVE NO STATED MATURITY ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CUSTOMER

BEHAVIOR, AND PRODUCT MIX.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE

SCENARIOS ARE ALSO REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE, NONPARALLEL RATE

(B)

EXCLUDES ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS LOSSES.

THE CHANGE IN EARNINGS AT RISK FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESULTED FROM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

REPOSITIONING, ASSUMED HIGHER LEVELS OF DEPOSIT BALANCES AND REDUCED LEVELS OF FIXED-RATE LOANS.

THE FIRMS RISK TO RISING RATES WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF WIDENING DEPOSIT MARGINS, WHICH ARE

CURRENTLY COMPRESSED DUE TO VERY LOW SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.

ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER INTEREST RATE SCENARIO CONDUCTED BY THE FIRM  INVOLVING A STEEPER YIELD

CURVE WITH LONG-TERM RATES RISING BY 100 BASIS POINTS AND SHORT-TERM RATES STAYING AT CURRENT

LEVELS  RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH PRETAX EARNINGS BENEFIT OF $770 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS

UNDER THIS SCENARIO IS DUE TO REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSETS AT THE HIGHER

LONG-TERM

RATES, WITH

FUNDING COSTS REMAINING UNCHANGED.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK

APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE

FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS SENIOR MANAGEMENT RISK APPETITE, MARKET VOLATILITY,

PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, ACCOMMODATION OF CLIENT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

FIRMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING

CERTAIN RISK LIMITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS

LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE-OF-BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS. BUSINESSES ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED.

LIMIT BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED

LINE-OF-BUSINESS IS REQUIRED TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS OR CONSULT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON THE

APPROPRIATE ACTION.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT

ARE INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. THESE PRICING MODELS AND VAR MODELS ARE USED FOR

MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. THE MODEL

RISK GROUP, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS THE MODELS

THE FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A

NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE WHETHER THE MODEL ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

TRANSACTION AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SUITABILITY AND CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL

ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES, CONSISTENCY OF THE TREATMENT WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR

PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE

MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED OF NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS

WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT MAY AFFECT THE MODELS VALIDITY

AND WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 149154 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES,

VAR, LOSS ADVISORIES AND LIMIT EXCESSES ARE REPORTED DAILY TO THE

LINES OF BUSINESS AND TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT. MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TRENDS, VAR TRENDS, PROFIT-AND-LOSS CHANGES AND PORTFOLIO

CONCENTRATIONS ARE REPORTED WEEKLY. STRESS-TEST RESULTS ARE ALSO REPORTED WEEKLY TO THE LINES OF

BUSINESS AND TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAKES PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM HOLDING

PERIODS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK OF

POSITIONS HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS APPROACH TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING

EXPECTED LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE

PORTFOLIOS. INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND INTENDED TO ENSURE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIOS. ALL INVESTMENTS ARE APPROVED BY INVESTMENT COMMITTEES THAT

INCLUDE

EXECUTIVES WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO WAS $8.7 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

WHICH $875 MILLION AND $762 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTED PUBLICLY-TRADED POSITIONS. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, SEE PAGE 90 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR

SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL

RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS

INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE

FIRM, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND

A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE

GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS

AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

ONE OF THE WAYS OPERATIONAL RISK IS MITIGATED IS THROUGH INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM

PURCHASES INSURANCE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS TO SERVE OTHER

NEEDS OF THE FIRM. INSURANCE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE FIRM DOES

BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE PURCHASED IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL

RISK SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF

OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND

ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER, THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS MONITORING

AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY

GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES. ALL BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE FIRMS STANDARD SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS

AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND

ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR

CONTROL ISSUES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING

THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS MEASURED FOR EACH BUSINESS ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE USING A

STATISTICALLY BASED LOSS-DISTRIBUTION APPROACH. THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, POTENTIAL STRESS

SCENARIOS AND MEASURES OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT ARE THEN FACTORED INTO THE STATISTICAL MEASURE IN

DETERMINING FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL. THIS METHODOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

ADVANCED MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS

AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY

RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED ENABLES THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST

AGAINST SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE FIRM IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE OPERATIONAL RISKDATA EXCHANGE

ASSOCIATION, A NOT-FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING OPERATIONAL

LOSS DATA, SHARING DATA IN AN ANONYMOUS FORM AND BENCHMARKING RESULTS

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION

ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL

RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE

CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

AND REPORTING. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND THE LOSS DATA-COLLECTION AND REPORTING ACTIVITIES.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISK, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE

AMONG ITS MANY CONSTITUENTSCUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL

PUBLICOF A REPUTATION FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION HAS

ALWAYS BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRMS REPUTATION IS THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL

RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

FIRMS FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVER SACRIFICE INTEGRITY  OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT

HE OR SHE HAS  EVEN IF ONE THINKS IT WOULD HELP THE FIRMS BUSINESS. THE CODE REQUIRES PROMPT

REPORTING OF ANY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED VIOLATION OF THE CODE, ANY INTERNAL FIRM POLICY, OR ANY LAW OR

REGULATION APPLICABLE TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE REPORTING OF ANY ILLEGAL

CONDUCT, OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE CODE, BY ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT WORKERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS OR AGENTS. CONCERNS MAY BE REPORTED ANONYMOUSLY AND

THE FIRM PROHIBITS RETALIATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES FOR THE GOOD FAITH REPORTING OF ANY ACTUAL OR

SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

IN ADDITION TO TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES WITH REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE,

AND REQUIRING ANNUAL AFFIRMATION BY EACH EMPLOYEE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE, THE FIRM HAS

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND HAS IN PLACE VARIOUS OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS, INTENDED TO

PROMOTE THE FIRMS CULTURE OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. THESE INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE WHICH

EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM. IN

ADDITION, EACH LINE OF BUSINESS HAS A RISK COMMITTEE WHICH INCLUDES IN ITS MANDATE OVERSIGHT OF THE

REPUTATIONAL RISKS IN ITS BUSINESS THAT MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. IN

IB, THERE IS A SEPARATE REPUTATION RISK OFFICE AND SEVERAL REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK COMMITTEES,

MEMBERS OF WHICH ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESSES AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, THAT FOCUS ON

TRANSACTIONS THAT RAISE REPUTATIONAL ISSUES. SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLEX

DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM ALSO ESTABLISHED THIS YEAR A CONSUMER

REPUTATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE, COMPRISED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT FROM THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE,

INCLUDING THE HEADS OF ITS PRIMARY CONSUMER FACING BUSINESSES, RFS AND CS, THAT HELPS TO ENSURE

THAT THE FIRM HAS A CONSISTENT, DISCIPLINED FOCUS ON THE REVIEW OF THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS OF CHASE

PRODUCTS AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING ANY THAT COULD RAISE REPUTATIONAL ISSUES.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS WITH RELEVANT LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, WITH

THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR

FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT

ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

AND EXPECTATIONS; CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATIONS; AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS.

IN THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE

PERFORMANCE AND RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE

RISE TO SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY

RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE FIRMS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING

ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO

ASCERTAIN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND

CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART

OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD

TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR

CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR

DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE RETAINED WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN

PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS TO REFLECT PROBABLE

CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS ESTABLISHED TO COVER PROBABLE LOSSES IN THE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS PORTFOLIO. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE

FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION

OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN ESTABLISHING THE INPUTS USED TO

ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCES. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC

FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO, AND TO REFINE LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE

CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK-RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE

THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE

AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND

THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION

OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION.

EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE RISK RATING

ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES.

WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF LOSS,

INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO WHETHER THE LOSS ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER THE

ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE, AS WELL AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA

SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS

SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF

DIFFERENT INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE

BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET

REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND

DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS,

QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRMS WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, ASSUMING A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS FOR ITS

ENTIRE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WOULD

INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR ALL WHOLESALE LOANS WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME IS

REMOTE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT OF RISK RATINGS ON

THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR WHOLESALE LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION IN RISK RATINGS. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM

FOLLOWS IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RISK RATINGS

CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO WHOLESALE LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE.

CONSUMER LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS SENSITIVE TO

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DELINQUENCY STATUS, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, FICO

SCORES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS, AND IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE CREDIT

PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONSUMER CREDIT PRODUCT SPECTRUM HAS

STABILIZED BUT HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO RESULT IN AN

ELEVATED LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS, WHILE WEAK HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SEVERITY

OF LOSSES REALIZED ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS THAT DEFAULT. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED

TO ESTIMATE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

149

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AS WELL AS ITS POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON HOUSING PRICES AND THE LABOR MARKET. WHILE THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS HIGHLY

SENSITIVE TO BOTH HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, IN THE CURRENT MARKET IT IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ONE OR BOTH OF THESE FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE BOTH FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE

LEVELS, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR OR THE OTHER MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE

DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE

OTHER. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL

GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN

BOTH OR EITHER OF THESE FACTORS WOULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF

LOSSES OR BOTH; OVERALL LOSS RATES ARE A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL

LOAN LOSSES.

THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS

TO POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES IN

THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN

PORTFOLIO CATEGORY, USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE PROBABLE

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT USES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS

AND CONSIDERS

PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL

LOSS ESTIMATE. THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THEN ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL

IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET

REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION; THIS ADJUSTMENT IS

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. IN

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY

OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. THE

APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS INTO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED BY

MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND

EMPHASIZING ONE INPUT OR ASSUMPTION OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING OTHER INPUTS OR ASSUMPTIONS, COULD

AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORIES

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A

PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE

THAT ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

UNDER U.S. GAAP THERE IS A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. AN INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

INPUT THAT

IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. THEREFORE, FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN

LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY, WHERE INPUTS ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA,

THERE IS LESS JUDGMENT APPLIED IN ARRIVING AT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT. THE FIRM REVIEWS AND UPDATES THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CLASSIFICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES FROM ONE QUARTER TO THE NEXT

RELATED TO THE OBSERVABILITY OF INPUTS TO A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT MAY RESULT IN A RECLASSIFICATION

BETWEEN HIERARCHY LEVELS.

TABLE ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT REDUCE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FOR NETTING

ADJUSTMENTS, AS SUCH AN ADJUSTMENT IS NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION THAT IS BASED ON THE

TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION. THEREFORE, THE DERIVATIVE BALANCES REPORTED IN THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS ARE GROSS OF ANY COUNTERPARTY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE

FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES WOULD BE $12.7 BILLION AND $16.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VALUATION

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR

INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS. THE FIRMS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ALL

APPLICABLE INPUTS ARE APPROPRIATELY CALIBRATED TO MARKET DATA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD

CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT

CURVES. IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS

MATURITY. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRMS

CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS THAT ARE APPLIED

CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.

FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE

MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3,

MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF

OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING

VALUATION INPUTS  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES,

EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION,

MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY. FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE

APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

QUALITY, THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, WHERE

RELEVANT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC

CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. THE

FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AN INDEPENDENT

MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC

PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS OF THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE VERIFICATION

GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS, ENSURES OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND

MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED FOR VALUATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL

PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE

ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING IS PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL

VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS; BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT; AND

DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER

TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP,

ARE BASED ON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO CONFIRM THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND

PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES

TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. DURING 2010, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO

THE FIRMS VALUATION

MODELS THAT HAD, OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS

RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE

APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD

RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN LOANS WITH

EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION OF CREDIT QUALITY SINCE ORIGINATION AND FOR WHICH IT WAS PROBABLE, AT

ACQUISITION, THAT THE FIRM WOULD BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS

RECEIVABLE. THESE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS AND ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE APPLICATION OF

THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR PCI LOANS REQUIRES A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT, SUCH

AS DETERMINING: (I) WHICH LOANS ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PCI ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, (II) THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE PCI LOANS AT ACQUISITION, (III) HOW LOANS ARE AGGREGATED TO APPLY THE GUIDANCE ON

ACCOUNTING FOR POOLS OF LOANS, AND (IV) ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE TERM OF

THE LOANS.

DETERMINING WHICH LOANS ARE IN THE SCOPE OF PCI ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, CONSUMER LOANS WITH CERTAIN

ATTRIBUTES (E.G., HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, BORROWERS WITH LOWER FICO SCORES, DELINQUENCIES)

WERE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED, PROVIDED THAT THOSE ATTRIBUTES AROSE SUBSEQUENT TO THE

LOANS ORIGINATION DATES. A WHOLESALE LOAN WAS DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED IF IT WAS

RISK-RATED SUCH THAT IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE REQUIRED AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, THE FIRM RECORDED ITS PCI LOANS AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE

OF LOSSES THAT WERE THEN EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS.

THE FIRM ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS PCI LOANS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE BY DISCOUNTING THE CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AT A MARKET-OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE, ADJUSTED FOR

FACTORS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF

CASH FLOWS TO BE COLLECTED WAS DERIVED FROM ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES AND

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS.

THE PCI ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE STATES THAT INVESTORS MAY AGGREGATE LOANS INTO POOLS THAT HAVE COMMON

RISK CHARACTERISTICS AND THEREBY USE A COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED

TO BE COLLECTED FOR THE POOLS. THE POOLS THEN BECOME THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AND ARE CONSIDERED ONE

LOAN FOR PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTING FOR THESE LOANS AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO ACQUISITION. ONCE A POOL IS

ASSEMBLED, THE INTEGRITY OF THE POOL MUST BE

152

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAINTAINED. THE FIRM HAS AGGREGATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE PCI LOANS IDENTIFIED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION (I.E., THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

LOANS) INTO POOLS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE

WHETHER INDIVIDUAL LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING POOLS OF

LOANS.

THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED MUST BE UPDATED EACH REPORTING PERIOD

BASED ON UPDATED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS.

THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICE DECLINES, AND

THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THESE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY

SUBJECTIVE. THESE ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AND/OR INTEREST INCOME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, A 1% DECREASE

IN EXPECTED FUTURE PRINCIPAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THESE LOANS OF

APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER U.S. GAAP, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY. THE FIRMS PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY USED TO CONDUCT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS.

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ESTIMATES OF (A) THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE

FIRMS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, SUCH

AS THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CARD ACT, AND LIMITATIONS ON NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES AND (B) THE

RELEVANT COST OF EQUITY AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN

AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY

OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES BY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS (FAIR VALUE AS

A PERCENT OF CARRYING VALUE RANGED FROM 120% TO 380%) AND DID NOT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND VALUATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES IN RFS AND CS EACH EXCEEDED THEIR

CARRYING VALUES BY APPROXIMATELY 25% AND 7% RESPECTIVELY AND THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL REMAINS AT

AN ELEVATED RISK OF IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THEIR EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION OF THESE BUSINESSES

INCLUDE (A) ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS (WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING BALANCES,

NET INTEREST MARGIN, OPERATING EXPENSE, CREDIT LOSSES, AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL NECESSARY GIVEN

THE RISK OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES TO MEET REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS), (B) THE COST OF EQUITY

USED TO DISCOUNT THOSE CASH FLOWS TO A PRESENT VALUE. EACH OF THESE FACTORS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST AND MOST CURRENT PROJECTIONS,

INCLUDING THOSE DERIVED FROM THE FIRMS BUSINESS FORECASTING PROCESS REVIEWED WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE

PROJECTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SHORT-TERM ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN BUSINESS OUTLOOK ON PAGES

5758 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND, IN THE LONGER TERM, INCORPORATE A SET OF MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS

(FOR EXAMPLE, ALLOWING FOR RELATIVELY HIGH BUT GRADUALLY DECLINING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR THE NEXT

FEW YEARS) AND THE FIRMS BEST ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH AND RETURNS OF ITS BUSINESSES. WHERE

POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES THIRD-PARTY AND PEER DATA TO BENCHMARK ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. THE

COST OF EQUITY USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL REFLECTED THE ESTIMATED RISK AND UNCERTAINTY

IN THESE BUSINESSES AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON WITH RELEVANT MARKET PEERS.

THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, OR AT ANYTIME DURING 2010,

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS,

INCREASED ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS OF RECENT REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, OR ADDITIONAL

REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN PROJECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BEYOND

MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CS SUCH DECLINES COULD RESULT FROM DETERIORATION

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS: INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS OR BANKRUPTCY FILINGS THAT RESULT IN

INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR THAT CAUSE DECREASED ACCOUNT ACTIVITY OR

RECEIVABLES BALANCES, OR UNANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. IN RFS, SUCH

DECLINES COULD RESULT FROM DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED CREDIT

LOSSES, INCLUDING DECREASES IN HOME PRICES BEYOND MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS; OR LOAN

REPURCHASE COSTS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. SUCH DECLINES IN

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, OR INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY, COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN

A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE

OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO

INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS, AS WELL AS

MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN ITEMS MAY AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX

JURISDICTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND EXAMINATION

BY THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FIRM OPERATES, AND DISPUTES MAY

OCCUR REGARDING ITS VIEW ON A TAX POSITION. THESE DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS

TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED BY AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OR ADJUDICATION IN THE COURT

SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS

WHETHER IT MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS,

AND THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS

ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS, LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS AND TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVISIONS IN THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES MAY MATERIALLY

AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

THE FIRMS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPOSED OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES. DEFERRED TAXES

ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING VERSUS

INCOME TAX

RETURN PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, THEIR

REALIZABILITY IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THE FIRM PERFORMS REGULAR REVIEWS TO

ASCERTAIN WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH ALSO INCORPORATES VARIOUS TAX PLANNING

STRATEGIES, INCLUDING STRATEGIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSSES BEFORE THEY

EXPIRE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REVIEWS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT

REALIZABLE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REVERSED IN A

SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD IF THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT, BASED ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE

TAXABLE INCOME OR CHANGES IN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR PART

OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BECOME REALIZABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, MANAGEMENT HAS

DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF

THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD ARE

MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE. AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AT

THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED UPON

SETTLEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REASSESSMENT OCCURS.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING

FOR THE TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW

GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS,

FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER LOAN

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) DEFERRED THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR VIES FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL

FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS, UNTIL THE FASB RECONSIDERS THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE FOR THESE FUNDS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2010, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES, AND CLARIFIES EXISTING

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE CLARIFICATIONS AND THE REQUIREMENT TO

SEPARATELY DISCLOSE TRANSFERS OF INSTRUMENTS BETWEEN LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY ARE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009; THE FIRM

ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS GUIDANCE, SEE NOTE 3

ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. IN ADDITION, A NEW REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES AND

SETTLEMENTS IN THE LEVEL 3 ROLLFORWARD ON A GROSS BASIS IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING

AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2010.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

IN MAY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESTABLISHED GENERAL STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTING FOR AND

DISCLOSURE OF EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE BUT BEFORE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

ISSUED OR ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL FINANCIAL

PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB AMENDED THE GUIDANCE BY ELIMINATING

THE REQUIREMENT FOR SEC FILERS TO DISCLOSE THE DATE THROUGH WHICH IT EVALUATED SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED THE AMENDED GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. THE APPLICATION OF THE GUIDANCE

HAD NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN EMBEDDED CREDIT DERIVATIVES

IN MARCH 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A CREDIT DERIVATIVE

EMBEDDED IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER

BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2010, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. UPON ADOPTION, THE NEW GUIDANCE

PERMITS THE ELECTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL

ASSETS. THE FIRM ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY, EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF

THE GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, SEE

NOTE 6 ON PAGES 191199 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTING FOR TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS OF PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS THAT ARE PART OF A POOL

IN APRIL 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE ACCOUNTING FOR TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

(TDRS) OF PCI LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR WITHIN A POOL. THE GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT MODIFIED PCI LOANS

SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED FROM A POOL EVEN IF THE MODIFICATION WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONSIDERED A TDR.

ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT THE IMPACT OF MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN

EVALUATING WHETHER A POOL OF LOANS IS IMPAIRED. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM BEGINNING

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, AND IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH

THE FIRMS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING ACCOUNTING PRACTICE AND, THEREFORE, HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

IN JULY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES SURROUNDING THE CREDIT

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO

DISCLOSE ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE METHODS IT USES TO DETERMINE THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AND QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN

THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CERTAIN TYPES OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS. FOR

THE FIRM, THE NEW DISCLOSURES BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE 2010 ANNUAL

REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTES 14 AND 15 ON

PAGES 220-243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE ONLY AFFECTS JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURES OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND NOT ITS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN JANUARY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE

THAT DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CERTAIN DISCLOSURES IN THIS GUIDANCE REGARDING TDRS, PENDING

RESOLUTION ON THE FASBS PROJECT TO AMEND THE SCOPE OF TDR GUIDANCE.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING

AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN

CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE

FRAMEWORK IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE COSO CRITERIA.

BASED UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN

CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA.

ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, IN CONFORMITY

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION,

THE FIRM MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE FIRMS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND ON THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING

AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS

FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AND PROVIDE THE EQUITY INVESTORS

VOTING RIGHTS THAT ENABLE THEM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITYS OPERATIONS.

FOR THESE TYPES OF ENTITIES, THE FIRMS DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

PRIMARILY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS HELD. ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITIES VOTING EQUITY

INTERESTS, OR THROUGH OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE THE FIRM CONTROL, ARE CONSOLIDATED BY THE

FIRM.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING

DECISIONS (BUT DOES NOT OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR (I) IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (WHICH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO RECOGNIZE ITS

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITYS NET EARNINGS), OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION

WAS ELECTED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN

OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

THE FIRM-SPONSORED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR

LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES. FOR THE

SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE FIRM IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER, BUT THE

NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR

MANAGING MEMBER WITHOUT CAUSE (I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS), BASED ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE, OR THE

NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY,

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS

OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUT OR PARTICIPATING RIGHTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE

FUNDS.

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES, INCLUDING

INVESTMENTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES AND ACCORDINGLY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS HELD, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, AND ARE

RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT, BY DESIGN, EITHER (1) LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO

FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2)

HAVE EQUITY INVESTORS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO

THE ENTITYS OPERATIONS THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS, OR DO NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE EXPECTED

LOSSES, OR DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY.

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (SPE). SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM

THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, AS THEY PROVIDE MARKET

LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. SPES MAY BE

ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE

INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS

OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED NEW CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. THE

NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF QUALIFIED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES) THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY EXEMPT FROM CONSOLIDATION, AND INTRODUCES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE VIE.

UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS THE PARTY THAT HAS BOTH (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT

THE ACTIVITIES OF AN ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND (2)

THROUGH ITS INTERESTS IN THE VIE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS

FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES,

INCLUDING ITS ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE VIE AND ITS ONGOING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS

ASSESSMENT INCLUDES, FIRST, IDENTIFYING THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND SECOND, IDENTIFYING WHICH PARTY, IF ANY, HAS POWER OVER THOSE ACTIVITIES.

IN GENERAL, THE PARTIES THAT MAKE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE VIE (SUCH AS ASSET

MANAGERS, COLLATERAL MANAGERS, SERVICERS, OR OWNERS OF CALL OPTIONS OR LIQUIDATION RIGHTS OVER THE

VIES ASSETS) OR HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY REMOVE THOSE DECISION-MAKERS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE THE

POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE.

164

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL OF

ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SERVICING FEES, AND DERIVATIVE OR

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THE VIE. THIS ASSESSMENT REQUIRES THAT THE

FIRM APPLY JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THESE INTERESTS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ARE CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDE: THE

DESIGN OF THE VIE, INCLUDING ITS CAPITALIZATION STRUCTURE; SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS; PAYMENT

PRIORITY; RELATIVE SHARE OF INTERESTS HELD ACROSS VARIOUS CLASSES WITHIN THE VIES CAPITAL

STRUCTURE; AND THE REASONS WHY THE INTERESTS ARE HELD BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM PERFORMS ON-GOING REASSESSMENTS OF: (1) WHETHER ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED UNDER THE

MAJORITY VOTING-INTEREST FRAMEWORK HAVE BECOME VIES, BASED ON CERTAIN EVENTS, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT

TO THE VIE CONSOLIDATION FRAMEWORK; AND (2) WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

REGARDING THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH A VIE CAUSE THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION CONCLUSION TO CHANGE.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE FIRMS APPLICATION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY

1, 2010, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED AN AMENDMENT WHICH DEFERRED THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS,

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS TO WHICH THE DEFERRAL APPLIES, THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO APPLY OTHER EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH FUNDS SHOULD BE

CONSOLIDATED.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

FOR REPORTING PERIODS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010, THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS

APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE) FRAMEWORK AND THE VIE FRAMEWORK.

THE APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDED ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT

ENTITY. THE QSPE FRAMEWORK WAS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY SOLD FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE MEETING

CERTAIN DEFINED CRITERIA THAT WERE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY WERE

ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE FINANCIAL

ASSETS COULD NOT EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THE ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. QSPES WERE NOT

CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AS LONG AS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL

ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OR TO CAUSE THE ENTITY TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA. THE FIRMS

SECURITIZATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS

GENERALLY WERE EVALUATED USING THE QSPE FRAMEWORK. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE OTHER SPES WERE EVALUATED USING THE VIE FRAMEWORK, WHICH WAS BASED ON A RISK AND

REWARD APPROACH, AND REQUIRED A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E., AN INVESTOR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTY

TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF THAT PARTY ABSORBED A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE

VIE, RECEIVED THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. IN MAKING THE

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE FIRM SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VIE, THE FIRM EVALUATED THE VIES DESIGN,

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. IF THE FIRM COULD NOT

IDENTIFY THE PARTY THAT

CONSOLIDATES A VIE THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM PERFORMED A

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPUTED AND ALLOCATED EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS TO VARIABLE

INTEREST HOLDERS. THE ALLOCATION OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON THE RELATIVE

RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF EACH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE. THE FIRM

RECONSIDERED WHETHER IT WAS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE ONLY WHEN CERTAIN DEFINED EVENTS

OCCURRED.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND

DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES

INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S.

REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. GAINS AND

LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID ON APRIL 30, 2009, TO SHAREHOLDERS

OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009.

ACQUISITION OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON

MUTUAL BANK

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

(WASHINGTON MUTUAL) FROM THE FDIC FOR $1.9 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION EXPANDED JPMORGAN CHASES

CONSUMER BRANCH NETWORK INTO SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA WASHINGTON, GEORGIA,

IDAHO, NEVADA AND OREGON AND CREATED THE THIRD LARGEST BRANCH NETWORK IN THE U.S. THE ACQUISITION

ALSO EXTENDED THE REACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS BANKING, COMMERCIAL BANKING, CREDIT CARD, CONSUMER

LENDING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES.

THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BE INITIALLY REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

IN 2008, THE $1.9 BILLION PURCHASE PRICE WAS PRELIMINARILY ALLOCATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF

THE ACQUISITION, NONCURRENT

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE, SUCH

AS THE PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, WERE WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST THE NEGATIVE

GOODWILL.

THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER WRITING DOWN THE NONFINANCIAL ASSETS WAS

RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FINAL TOTAL

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS $2.0 BILLION.

THE FINAL SUMMARY COMPUTATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE FINAL TOTAL

PURCHASE PRICE OF $1.9 BILLION TO THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED OF

MERGER WITH THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC.

EFFECTIVE MAY 30, 2008, BSC MERGER CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE, MERGED

WITH THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,

DATED AS OF MARCH 16, 2008, AS AMENDED MARCH 24, 2008, AND BEAR STEARNS BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THE MERGER PROVIDED THE FIRM WITH A LEADING GLOBAL PRIME BROKERAGE

PLATFORM; STRENGTHENED THE FIRMS EQUITIES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES; ENHANCED CAPABILITIES

IN MORTGAGE ORIGINATION, SECURITIZATION AND SERVICING; AND EXPANDED THE PLATFORM OF THE FIRMS

ENERGY BUSINESS.

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH

REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BEAR STEARNS BE FAIR VALUED.

THE FINAL TOTAL PURCHASE

PRICE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WAS $1.5 BILLION.

THE MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE REFLECTED

AS STEP ACQUISITIONS.

ON APRIL 8, 2008, PURSUANT TO A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT, JPMORGAN CHASE

ACQUIRED 95 MILLION NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK (OR 39.5% OF BEAR STEARNS

COMMON STOCK AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE ISSUANCE) FOR 20.7 MILLION SHARES OF JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON

STOCK. FURTHER, BETWEEN MARCH 24, 2008, AND MAY 12, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 24

MILLION SHARES OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET AT AN AVERAGE PURCHASE PRICE OF

$12.37 PER SHARE. THE SHARE EXCHANGE AND CASH PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS RESULTED IN JPMORGAN CHASE

OWNING APPROXIMATELY 49.4% OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO CONSUMMATION OF THE

MERGER. FINALLY, ON MAY 30, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED THE MERGER. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER,

EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK (OTHER THAN SHARES

THEN HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASE)

WAS CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.21753 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE. ALSO, ON

MAY 30, 2008, THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS ACQUIRED FROM EACH

OTHER IN THE SHARE EXCHANGE TRANSACTION WERE CANCELLED.

FROM APRIL 8, 2008, THROUGH MAY 30, 2008,

JPMORGAN CHASE ACCOUNTED FOR THE INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

DURING THIS PERIOD, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDED REDUCTIONS TO ITS INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS

REPRESENTING ITS SHARE OF BEAR STEARNS NET LOSSES, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF

THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED (INCLUDING GOODWILL), PRESENTED IN THE TABLES BELOW, REPRESENT JPMORGAN

CHASES NET LOSSES RECORDED UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, IN JUNE 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

(THE FRBNY) TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (LLC) FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF

A PORTFOLIO OF $30 BILLION IN ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM BEAR STEARNS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE

PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE LLC WERE FUNDED BY A $28.85 BILLION TERM LOAN

FROM THE FRBNY, AND A $1.15 BILLION SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN

IS SUBORDINATED TO THE FRBNY LOAN AND WILL BEAR THE FIRST $1.15 BILLION OF ANY LOSSES OF THE

PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF THE FRBNY LOAN, THE JPMORGAN

CHASE NOTE AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LLC WILL BE FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE FRBNY.

COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRO FORMA COMPUTATION OF DILUTED

LOSS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS THE EFFECT WOULD BE ANTIDILUTIVE.

THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES

ONLY AND DOES NOT INDICATE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY HAD THE COMPANIES ACTUALLY

BEEN COMBINED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS. INCLUDED IN THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF BEAR STEARNS

AND WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS, CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING, VALUATION AND

ACCOUNTING CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS. FOR THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, THE AMORTIZATION OF

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS TO REPORT INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS ACQUIRED AND INTEREST-BEARING

LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES IS REFLECTED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND THE ADJUSTMENT TO CONFORM ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGIES IN THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION, AND VALUATION AND ACCOUNTING CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER ARE REFLECTED IN THE RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

INTERNAL REORGANIZATION RELATED TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER

ON JUNE 30, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED EACH SERIES OF OUTSTANDING

PREFERRED STOCK OF BEAR STEARNS, AS WELL AS ALL OF BEAR STEARNS OUTSTANDING U.S. SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) REGISTERED U.S. DEBT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON JULY 15, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED AN

INTERNAL MERGER TRANSACTION, WHICH RESULTED IN EACH SERIES OF OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK OF BEAR

STEARNS BEING AUTOMATICALLY EXCHANGED INTO NEWLY-ISSUED SHARES OF JPMORGAN CHASE PREFERRED STOCK

HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TERMS. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO INTERNAL TRANSACTIONS IN JULY 2008

AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE ASSUMED OR GUARANTEED THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING

SECURITIES OF BEAR STEARNS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INDENTURES AND

OTHER AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THOSE SECURITIES. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, ALL OF THE ABOVE SERIES OF

PREFERRED STOCK, AND THE DEPOSITARY SHARES REPRESENTING SUCH PREFERRED STOCK, WERE REDEEMED ON

AUGUST 20, 2010.

OTHER BUSINESS EVENTS

REDEMPTION OF SERIES E, F AND G CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

ON AUGUST 20, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE REDEEMED AT STATED REDEMPTION VALUE, ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

ITS SERIES E 6.15% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK; SERIES F 5.72% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK; AND

SERIES G 5.49% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PREFERRED STOCK, SEE NOTE 23

ON PAGES 267268 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RBS SEMPRA TRANSACTION

ON JULY 1, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF RBS SEMPRA COMMODITIES GLOBAL OIL,

GLOBAL METALS AND EUROPEAN POWER AND GAS BUSINESSES. THE FIRM ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION

OF NET ASSETS WHICH INCLUDED $3.3 BILLION OF DEBT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAID. THIS ACQUISITION

ALMOST DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS THE FIRMS COMMODITIES BUSINESS CAN SERVE AND WILL ENABLE THE

FIRM TO OFFER CLIENTS MORE PRODUCTS IN MORE REGIONS OF THE WORLD.

PURCHASE OF REMAINING INTEREST IN J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE

ON JANUARY 4, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE PURCHASED THE REMAINING INTEREST IN J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE, AN

INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP FORMED IN 2005, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

FIRMS CAPITAL SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION.

TERMINATION OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE

THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE, A GLOBAL PAYMENTS AND MERCHANT

ACQUIRING JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND FIRST DATA CORPORATION, WAS COMPLETED ON

NOVEMBER 1, 2008. JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE BUSINESS, WHICH IT OPERATES

UNDER THE NAME CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS. THE DISSOLUTION

OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A STEP ACQUISITION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND THE FIRM RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF

$627 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AS A RESULT OF THE DISSOLUTION. THE GAIN REPRESENTS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED (PREDOMINANTLY INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND

GOODWILL) EXCEEDED JPMORGAN CHASES CARRYING VALUE IN THE NET ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO FIRST DATA

CORPORATION. UPON DISSOLUTION, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED THE RETAINED CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS

BUSINESS.

PROCEEDS FROM VISA INC. SHARES

ON MARCH 19, 2008, VISA INC. (VISA) COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). PRIOR TO THE

IPO, JPMORGAN CHASE HELD APPROXIMATELY A 13% EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA. ON MARCH 28, 2008, VISA USED

A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING TO REDEEM A PORTION OF THE FIRMS EQUITY INTEREST,

WHICH RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF A PRETAX GAIN OF $1.5 BILLION (RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME). IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE IPO, VISA PLACED $3.0 BILLION IN ESCROW TO COVER LIABILITIES RELATED TO

CERTAIN LITIGATION MATTERS. THE ESCROW WAS INCREASED BY $1.1 BILLION IN 2008, $700 MILLION IN 2009

AND BY $1.3 BILLION IN 2010.

INCREASES IN VISAS ESCROW ACCOUNT RESULTS IN A DILUTION OF THE VALUE

OF THE FIRMS OWNERSHIP OF VISA INC. JPMORGAN CHASES INTEREST IN THE ESCROW WAS RECORDED AS A

REDUCTION OF OTHER EXPENSE AND REPORTED NET TO THE EXTENT OF ESTABLISHED LITIGATION RESERVES.

PURCHASE OF REMAINING INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

IN JANUARY 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT, LLC (HIGHBRIDGE), WHICH RESULTED IN THE FIRM OWNING 77.5% OF HIGHBRIDGE. IN JULY

2009, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE, WHICH RESULTED

IN A $228 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO CAPITAL SURPLUS.

NOTE 3  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF

SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS, WHICH

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE AND THAT ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE, AS INPUTS, MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY

SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES,

EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN

ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY OF

THE INSTRUMENT. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRMS

CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (CVA) ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS

NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. AN

ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO

ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE ADJUSTMENT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED TO

REDUCE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO EACH COUNTERPARTY, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF

OFFSET.



DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM

IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE

ADJUSTMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH CVA AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED

THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP MARKET.



LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A

RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE)

MARKETS OR TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS

(LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT TAKEN FOR POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY; SEE BELOW). THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION

BASED ON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT TRADES AND

MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM

MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE

THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL

QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

COSTS TO EXIT LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE SIZE

OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A

POSITION DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL.



UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS UNOBSERVABLE

PARAMETERS  THAT IS,

PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SUCH

POSITIONS ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS WHERE

PARAMETERS SUCH AS CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE UNOBSERVABLE. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO MITIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR AND REVISION IN THE

ESTIMATE OF THE MARKET PRICE PROVIDED BY THE MODEL.

THE FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAIR VALUES ARE APPROPRIATE. AN

INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR

SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS WITHIN THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE

VERIFICATION GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION, ENSURES OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND

MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED

FOR VALUATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH

OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING IS

PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED

INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS;

VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT; AND DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION

OF RECORDED GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH

ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, ARE BASED ON ESTABLISHED POLICIES

AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT TO CONFIRM THAT THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE

PRICING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE OR LESS TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. DURING 2010, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS THAT HAD,

OR ARE EX-

PECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY

NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, WHILE

THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING

DATE.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER U.S. GAAP FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.



LEVEL 2  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY,

EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



LEVEL 3  ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT

TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL

OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM TO MEASURE INSTRUMENTS

AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

ASSETS

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES BORROWED

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS, CASH FLOWS

ARE FIRST EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES OF THE RESALE AGREEMENT AND

ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. AS THE INPUTS

INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON READILY OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, SUCH RESALE

AGREEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED.

THE FAIR VALUE OF

SUCH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF FAIR VALUE

OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP ON PAGES

185186 OF THIS NOTE. LOANS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING AND NONRECURRING BASIS ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPLICABLE TABLES

THAT FOLLOW.

WHOLESALE

THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR MOST LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN THE FIRMS

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE DIRECT

SECONDARY MARKET INFORMATION 

INCLUDING PRICING OF ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, BROKER QUOTATIONS OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS  IS AVAILABLE (PRINCIPALLY FOR LOANS IN THE FIRMS SECONDARY TRADING

PORTFOLIO), SUCH INFORMATION IS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE

PORTFOLIO, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) MODEL. IN ADDITION TO THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE AND

CONTRACTUAL FEES), KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL INCLUDE INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES AND CREDIT

SPREADS. THE CREDIT SPREAD INPUT IS DERIVED FROM THE COST OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS) AND, AS A

RESULT, ALSO INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF SECONDARY MARKET LIQUIDITY. AS MANY OF THE FIRMS CLIENTS

DO NOT HAVE BONDS TRADED WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS TO HAVE OBSERVABLE CDS

SPREADS, THE FIRM PRINCIPALLY DEVELOPS BENCHMARK CREDIT CURVES BY INDUSTRY AND CREDIT RATING TO

ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE VALUATION PROCESS ARE ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO

ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN LOSS SEVERITY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, ON WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS AS WELL AS LOAN EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED ON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO AN OBLIGOR DEFAULT). CERTAIN FLOATING RATE LOANS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THEIR SHORT

TERM NATURE AND NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK (E.G. BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR COLLATERALIZATION).

THE FIRMS LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN

THE MARKETS FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

CONSUMER

THE ONLY PRODUCTS IN THE FIRMS CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO WITH A MEANINGFUL LEVEL OF SECONDARY MARKET

ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ARE CERTAIN CONFORMING

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THESE LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THEY ARE PREDOMINANTLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF MARKET LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS OTHER CONSUMER LOANS (EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES) IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING THE LOAN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED AT A

MARKET OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE. PORTFOLIO-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT A MARKET

PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE (E.G., EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES,

ESTIMATED PREPAYMENTS, SERVICING COSTS AND MARKET LIQUIDITY) ARE EITHER MODELED INTO THE CASH FLOW

PROJECTIONS OR INCORPORATED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT CONTINUE TO

BE OFFERED IN THE MARKET, DISCOUNT RATES ARE DERIVED FROM MARKET-OBSERVABLE PRIMARY ORIGINATION RATES.

WHERE PRIMARY ORIGINATION RATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE (I.E., SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, SUBPRIME HOME EQUITY

AND OPTION ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES (OPTION ARMS)) THE VALUATION IS BASED ON THE FIRMS ESTIMATE

OF A MARKET PARTICIPANTS REQUIRED RETURN ON EQUITY FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS (I.E., A HYPOTHETICAL

ORIGINATION SPREAD). ESTIMATED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES CONSIDER EXPECTED AND CURRENT DEFAULT RATES

FOR EXISTING PORTFOLIOS, COLLATERAL PRICES (WHERE APPLICABLE) AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT CHANGES IN THE

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT (E.G., UNEMPLOYMENT RATES).

THE FAIR VALUE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGY. KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: PROJECTED INTEREST INCOME AND LATE FEE REVENUE,

FUNDING, SERVICING, CREDIT COSTS, AND LOAN PAYMENT RATES. THE PROJECTED LOAN PAYMENT RATES ARE USED

TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE CREDIT CARD LOAN RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED

USING A RISK-APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DERIVED FROM THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF A

MARKET PARTICIPANTS EXPECTED RETURN ON CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES.

AS THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO HAS A SHORT-TERM LIFE, AN AMOUNT EQUAL

TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS CONSIDERED A

REASONABLE PROXY FOR THE CREDIT COST COMPONENT.

LOANS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE ARE NOT CLASSIFIED

WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

MORTGAGE

LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

FOR CERTAIN LOANS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SECURITIZED, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING A COMBINATION

OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP

OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES.

WHEN RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY IS NOT OCCURRING OR IS LIMITED, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY PROJECTING

THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNTING THOSE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET

LIQUIDITY. TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OF A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN (INCLUSIVE OF

ASSUMPTIONS OF PREPAYMENT, DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY), SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO

BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE BORROWERS FICO

SCORE; THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THE LOANS; THE LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE LOAN; AND

MARKET-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS FOR HOME PRICE APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION IN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHY

OF THE BORROWER. FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC AND

OTHER MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE BORROWERS DEBT-TO-SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO;

THE TYPE OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (E.G., RETAIL, OFFICE, LODGING, MULTI-FAMILY,

ETC.); AN ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO; AND MARKET-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS FOR PROPERTY

PRICE APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION IN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. IN ADDITION, COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS TYPICALLY HAVE LOCK-OUT PERIODS WHERE THE BORROWER IS RESTRICTED FROM PREPAYING THE

LOAN DUE TO PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. THESE FEATURES REDUCE PREPAYMENT RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES

RELA-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIVE TO THAT OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THESE LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR THE

PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

SECURITIES

WHERE QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHLY LIQUID

GOVERNMENT BONDS; MORTGAGE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS SUCH AS

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE (COLLECTIVELY, U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES) MARKETS; PASS-THROUGH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS); AND EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITIES

(E.G., COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS).

IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THE FIRM MAY ESTIMATE THE

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G.,

INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO USE PRICING MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY;

HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACTIVITY OR LESS TRANSPARENCY AROUND INPUTS TO THE

VALUATION, SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, WHERE MARKET ACTIVITY IS NOT OCCURRING OR IS LIMITED, FAIR VALUE IS

ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF THE SECURITIES

HELD BY THE FIRM. THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL POOL SUPPORTING THE SECURITIES IS ANALYZED USING THE

SAME TECHNIQUES AND FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, ALBEIT IN A MORE

AGGREGATED MANNER ACROSS THE POOL. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR RESIDENTIAL MBS, FACTORS EVALUATED MAY INCLUDE

AVERAGE FICO SCORES, AVERAGE DELINQUENCY RATES, AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITIES AND PREPAYMENT RATES, AMONG

OTHER METRICS. FOR COMMERCIAL MBS, FACTORS EVALUATED MAY INCLUDE AVERAGE DELINQUENCIES, LOAN OR

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, AND AVERAGE DEBT-SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS, AMONG OTHER METRICS. IN

ADDITION, AS EACH SECURITIZATION VEHICLE DISTRIBUTES CASH IN A MANNER OR ORDER THAT IS

PREDETERMINED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE, THE PRIORITY IN WHICH EACH PARTICULAR MBS IS

ALLOCATED CASH FLOWS, AND THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THOSE CASH FLOWS, ARE

KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DERIVING THE VALUE OF MBS. FINALLY, THE RISK PREMIUM THAT INVESTORS DEMAND

FOR SECURITIZED PRODUCTS IN THE CURRENT MARKET IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION. TO BENCHMARK ITS

VALUATIONS, THE FIRM LOOKS TO TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS AND USES INDEPENDENT PRICING

PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND RELEVANT MARKET INDICES, SUCH AS THE ABX INDEX,

AS APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS

DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS ESTIMATES.

FOR CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) AND

HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES, THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE MAY REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES. FOR CASH COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

(CDOS), EXTERNAL PRICE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, CASH CDOS ARE VALUED USING

MARKET-STANDARD MODELS, SUCH AS INTEX, TO MODEL THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL COMPOSITION AND CASH FLOW

STRUCTURE OF EACH DEAL; KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE MARKET SPREAD DATA FOR EACH CREDIT RATING,

COLLATERAL TYPE AND OTHER RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL FEATURES. ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED

ON EXTERNAL PRICES OR MARKET SPREAD DATA, USING CURRENT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS ON PREPAYMENTS AND

DEFAULTS. FOR ABS WHERE THE EXTERNAL PRICE DATA IS NOT OBSERVABLE OR THE LIMITED AVAILABLE DATA IS

OPAQUE, THE COLLATERAL PERFORMANCE IS MONITORED AND CONSIDERED IN THE VALUATION OF THE SECURITY. TO

BENCHMARK ITS VALUATIONS, THE FIRM LOOKS TO TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS AND USES

INDEPENDENT PRICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND RELEVANT MARKET INDICES, SUCH

AS THE ABX INDEX, AS APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE,

THEY SERVE AS DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS ESTIMATES. THE MAJORITY

OF COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES AND ABS ARE CURRENTLY

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS (CLOS) ARE SECURITIES BACKED BY CORPORATE LOANS, AND THEY ARE

PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN THE FIRMS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. FOR THESE

SECURITIES, EXTERNAL PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. THEY ARE THEREFORE VALUED USING

MARKET-STANDARD MODELS TO MODEL THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL COMPOSITION AND CASH FLOW STRUCTURE OF EACH

DEAL; KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE MARKET SPREAD DATA FOR EACH CREDIT RATING, COLLATERAL TYPE AND

OTHER RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL FEATURES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE

12 ON PAGES 214218

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMODITIES

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICING AND DATA DERIVED FROM THE MARKETS ON

WHICH THE COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL

1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

THE FIRM ALSO HAS POSITIONS IN COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES THAT CAN BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE PRICING INPUTS TO THESE DERIVATIVES INCLUDE

FORWARD CURVES OF UNDERLYING COMMODITIES, BASIS CURVES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, AND

OCCASIONALLY OTHER MODEL PARAMETERS. THE VALUATION OF THESE DERIVATIVES IS BASED ON CALIBRATING TO

MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS TO INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION FROM SOURCES SUCH AS BROKERS AND

CONSENSUS PRICING SERVICES. WHERE INPUTS ARE HISTORICAL TIME SERIES DATA, THEY ARE ADJUSTED FOR

UNCERTAINTY WHERE APPROPRIATE. THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DERIVATIVES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY. HOWEVER, FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE; THUS,

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT

USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY

QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES. DEPENDING ON

THE TYPES AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF DERIVATIVES, FAIR VALUE CAN BE MODELED USING A SERIES OF

TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, SIMULATION MODELS OR A COMBINATION OF

VARIOUS MODELS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. WHERE DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR

SOME TIME, THE FIRM USES MODELS THAT ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THESE

MODELS REFLECT THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND

MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITY, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COUNTERPARTY. FURTHER, MANY OF THESE MODELS DO NOT CONTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVITY, AS THE

METHODOLOGIES USED IN THE MODELS DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, AND INPUTS TO THE MODELS ARE

READILY OBSERVABLE FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED MARKETS, AS IS THE CASE FOR PLAIN VANILLA INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, OPTION CONTRACTS AND CDS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND

THAT ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY, HAVE TRADE ACTIVITY THAT IS ONE WAY, AND/OR ARE TRADED IN

LESS-DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 3

DERIVATIVES INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, CDS REFERENCED TO CERTAIN MBS, CERTAIN TYPES OF CDO TRANSACTIONS,

OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF SINGLE-NAME STOCKS, AND CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

OTHER COMPLEX PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYING

PARAMETERS, ALSO FALL WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, AND INCLUDE STRUCTURED CREDIT

DERIVATIVES WHICH ARE ILLIQUID AND NON-STANDARD IN NATURE (E.G., SYNTHETIC CDOS COLLATERALIZED BY A

PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS CDS). FOR MOST CDO TRANSACTIONS, WHILE INPUTS SUCH AS CDS

SPREADS MAY BE OBSERVABLE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS UNOBSERVABLE.

CORRELATION LEVELS ARE MODELED ON A TRANSACTION BASIS AND CALIBRATED TO LIQUID BENCHMARK TRANCHE

INDICES. FOR ALL STRUCTURED CREDIT DERIVATIVES, ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WHERE AVAILABLE, ARE USED

REGULARLY TO RECALIBRATE ALL UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS.

CORRELATION SENSITIVITY IS ALSO MATERIAL TO THE OVERALL VALUATION OF OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF

SINGLE-NAME STOCKS; THE VALUATION OF THESE BASKETS IS TYPICALLY NOT OBSERVABLE DUE TO THEIR

NON-STANDARDIZED STRUCTURING. CORRELATION FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS THESE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED BASED

ON AN OBSERVABLE BASKET OF STOCKS AND THEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

UNDERLYING EQUITIES.

FOR CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, WHILE MOST OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE VALUATION CAN BE

OBSERVED IN ACTIVE MARKETS (E.G., INTEREST RATES AND VOLATILITY), THE CALLABLE OPTION TRANSACTION

FLOW IS ESSENTIALLY ONE-WAY, AND AS SUCH, PRICE OBSERVABILITY IS LIMITED. AS PRICING INFORMATION IS

LIMITED, ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE UNDERLYING MARKETS (E.G., THE INTEREST RATE

MARKETS) INCLUDING THE RANGE AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE APPLICABLE INPUTS. IN ADDITION, THE

MODELS USED ARE

CALIBRATED, AS RELEVANT, TO LIQUID BENCHMARKS, AND VALUATION IS TESTED AGAINST MONTHLY INDEPENDENT

PRICING SERVICES AND ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO

NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING DCF MODELS.



FOR MSRS, THE FIRM USES AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION MODEL IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO PROJECT MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST

RATE SCENARIOS; THESE SCENARIOS ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES TO ESTIMATE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE OAS MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY

SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER

ANCILLARY REVENUE, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND

PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT

MARKET CONDITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR

ASSET. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE VALUATION INPUTS, MSRS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.



FOR CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE FOR

THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS BY CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING

MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES,

SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES,

CONSIDERING THE RISK INVOLVED. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

ON THE FIRMS VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS, AND SUCH INTERESTS ARE THEREFORE TYPICALLY

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR

THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259, AND NOTE 17 ON

PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE VALUATION OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE HELD PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF BUSINESS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, THE INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND

THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS.

AS SUCH, NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED

INITIALLY BASED ON COST. EACH QUARTER, VALUATIONS ARE REVIEWED USING AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT MARKET

DATA TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED.

SUCH MARKET DATA PRIMARILY INCLUDE OBSERVATIONS OF

THE TRADING MULTIPLES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES CONSIDERED COMPARABLE

TO THE PRIVATE COMPANIES BEING VALUED AND THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE

UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO COMPANY, INCLUDING ITS HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED NET INCOME AND ITS EARNINGS

BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA). VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO

ACCOUNT FOR COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY INHERENT IN A NONPUBLIC INVESTMENT, AND

THE FACT THAT COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO THE COMPANIES BEING VALUED. IN

ADDITION, A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, FINANCING AND SALES TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES, FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR

INVESTMENT, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. NONPUBLIC PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLICLY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED

THROUGH THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATELY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES

OF PUBLICLY HELD COMPANIES THAT TRADE IN LIQUID MARKETS ARE MARKED TO MARKET AT THE QUOTED PUBLIC

VALUE LESS ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS.

DISCOUNTS FOR RESTRICTIONS

ARE QUANTIFIED BY ANALYZING THE LENGTH OF THE RESTRICTION PERIOD AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE EQUITY

SECURITY. PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

OTHER FUND INVESTMENTS

THE FIRM HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL/COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS

AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS. WHERE THE FUNDS PRODUCE A DAILY NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) THAT IS VALIDATED BY

A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY (PURCHASES AND SALES AT NAV), THE NAV IS USED TO VALUE

THE FUND INVESTMENT AND IT IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE ADJUSTMENTS

TO THE NAV ARE REQUIRED, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO INTERESTS IN FUNDS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON

REDEMPTION (SUCH AS LOCK-UP PERIODS OR WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS) AND/OR OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY FOR THE

FUND INVESTMENT IS LIMITED, INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

LIABILITIES

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS)

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, CASH FLOWS ARE FIRST EVALUATED TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING

THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS,

THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO, OR IN EXCESS OF,

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT, OR AN IMMATERIAL

ADJUSTMENT, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM (I.E., DVA) RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS. AS

THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FAIR VALUE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) IS

ESTIMATED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS HELD BY THE VIES. THE VALUATION OF

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM, AS

THE HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. WHERE THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICING INFORMATION, THE

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE

MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITIES, WITH AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

FIRM (I.E., THE DVA). INCLUDED WITHIN DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT ARE

STRUCTURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE FIRM THAT ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, THE ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED NOTES TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES. WHERE THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES, THE STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY. WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THE STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

THE LEVEL 3 AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES RELATED TO CREDIT

PRIMARILY INCLUDE STRUCTURED CREDIT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE

CLASSIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, SEE

PAGES 171175 OF THIS NOTE.

(F)

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO NET DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND

DERIVATIVE PAYABLES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PAID WHEN A LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES

NOT REDUCE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BALANCES FOR THIS NETTING

ADJUSTMENT, EITHER WITHIN OR ACROSS THE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS SUCH NETTING IS

NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY. THEREFORE, THE BALANCES REPORTED IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TABLE ABOVE

ARE GROSS OF ANY COUNTERPARTY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH

BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVE

PAYABLE BALANCES WOULD BE $12.7 BILLION AND $16.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUSIVE OF THE NETTING BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH CASH COLLATERAL, WHICH WOULD

FURTHER REDUCE THE LEVEL 3 BALANCES.

(G)

PRIVATE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF

BUSINESS. THE COST BASIS OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $10.0 BILLION AND

$8.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

(H)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, BALANCES INCLUDED INVESTMENTS VALUED AT NET ASSET VALUE OF

$12.1 BILLION AND $16.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $5.9 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1, $2.0 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

LEVEL 2 AND $4.2 BILLION AND $4.6 BILLION IN LEVEL 3.

(I)

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1

AND 2. TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 3 INTO LEVEL 2 INCLUDED $1.2 BILLION OF TRADING LOANS DUE TO

INCREASED PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3.

(J)

INCLUDED ASSETS WITHIN ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE AND OTHER ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A ROLLFORWARD OF THE BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE) FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY THE FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008. WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE DETERMINATION IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE

COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES);

ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE TABLE

BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY.

ALSO, THE FIRM RISK-MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY; AS THESE

LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES DO NOT REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO SUCH

LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS.

THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS,

AND OTHER LOANS WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL

(E.G., RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS CHARGED OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE), DEPENDS ON

THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL (E.G., SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, NONFINANCIAL ASSETS) UNDERLYING THE LOAN.

FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS ESTIMATED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, BROKER QUOTES OR

INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS, OR BY USING A DCF MODEL. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LEVEL 3 ANALYSIS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, MORTGAGE

SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS), COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS (CLOS) HELD WITHIN THE

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, TRADING LOANS, ASSET-BACKED TRADING SECURITIES AND PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS.



DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCLUDED $35.3 BILLION OF INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

EQUITY AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. INCLUDED WITHIN

THIS BALANCE WAS $11.6 BILLION OF STRUCTURED CREDIT DERIVATIVES WITH CORPORATE DEBT

UNDERLYING. IN ASSESSING THE FIRMS RISK EXPOSURE TO STRUCTURED CREDIT DERIVATIVES, THE FIRM

BELIEVES CONSIDERATION SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN TO DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES WITH SIMILAR, AND

THEREFORE OFFSETTING, RISK PROFILES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $5.6 BILLION OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE

LIABILITIES HAD RISK CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE ASSETS

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3.



MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING

SPECIFIED MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS (PREDOMINANTLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS). FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE MSR ASSET, INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY USED FOR MSRS, INCLUDING VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS AND SENSITIVITIES,

SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



CLOS TOTALING $13.5 BILLION WERE SECURITIES BACKED BY CORPORATE LOANS HELD IN THE FIRMS

AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED AAA, AA AND A

AND HAD AN AVERAGE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF 30%. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN CLOS IS PRIMARILY IN THE

FORM OF SUBORDINATION, WHICH IS A FORM OF STRUCTURAL

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT WHERE REALIZED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS HELD BY AN ISSUING VEHICLE ARE

ALLOCATED TO ISSUED TRANCHES CONSIDERING THEIR RELATIVE SENIORITY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

NOTE 12 ON PAGES 214218 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



TRADING LOANS TOTALING $13.1 BILLION INCLUDED $4.4 BILLION OF NONAGENCY RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE WHOLE LOANS AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS HELD IN IB FOR WHICH THERE IS LIMITED PRICE

TRANSPARENCY; AND $4.0 BILLION OF REVERSE MORTGAGES FOR WHICH THE PRINCIPAL RISK SENSITIVITIES

ARE MORTALITY RISK AND HOME PRICES. THE FAIR VALUE OF

AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES, WHICH ARE OBSERVABLE AND LIQUID.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CHANGES

LEVEL 3 ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS) WERE 5% OF TOTAL

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO LEVEL 3 ASSETS DURING THE YEAR.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010

LEVEL 3 ASSETS DECREASED BY $15.5 BILLION DURING 2010, DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.



$11.4 BILLION DECREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN

CREDIT SPREADS;



A NET DECREASE OF $3.5 BILLION DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO

VIES. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, THERE WAS A DECREASE OF $5.0 BILLION IN

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO RETAINED SECURITIZATION INTERESTS IN

FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE ELIMINATED UPON CONSOLIDATION,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1.5 BILLION IN TRADING DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS;



$2.8 BILLION DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, DRIVEN BY SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS AND TRANSFERS OF TRADING LOANS TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO INCREASED PRICE TRANSPARENCY;



$1.9 BILLION DECREASE IN MSRS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE, REFER TO NOTE 17 ON

PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT;



$2.2 BILLION INCREASE IN NONRECURRING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, LARGELY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN

CREDIT CARD LOANS;



$1.3 BILLION INCREASE IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, LARGELY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL FOLLOW-ON

INVESTMENTS AND NET GAINS IN THE PORTFOLIO; AND



$1.0 BILLION INCREASE IN ASSET-BACKED AFS SECURITIES, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY PURCHASES OF

CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INSTRUMENT, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RECORD A VALUATION

ADJUSTMENT TO ARRIVE AT AN EXIT PRICE UNDER U.S. GAAP. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRMS OWN CREDITWORTHINESS.

THE MARKETS VIEW OF THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY IS REFLECTED IN CREDIT SPREADS OBSERVED IN THE CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAP MARKET. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THE FIRM CONSIDERS, SEE

THE VALUATION DISCUSSION AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY HEDGING ACTIVITY,

REFLECTED WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF THE DATES INDICATED.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE)

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE

METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN

THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE

INCLUDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE

AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD

RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE

TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY

NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS; DEPOSITS WITH BANKS;

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD; SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WITH

SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE; COMMERCIAL PAPER;

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED; SECURITIES LOANED AND SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED

MATURITIES; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS (EXCLUDING ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (FHLBS));

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE; AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET

DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE; RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IS NOT PERMITTED.

FOR ORIGINATED OR

AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS, INTEREST APPLIED TO

PRINCIPAL (FOR LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD), UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND

PREMIUMS, AND DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS LOAN

ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(B)

FAIR VALUE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT INCORPORATES THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE AND

CONTRACTUAL FEES) AND KEY INPUTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES, INTEREST RATES,

PREPAYMENT RATES, AND PRIMARY ORIGINATION OR SECONDARY MARKET SPREADS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE IS THE RESULT

OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE AS

COMPARED TO CARRYING VALUE. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED FOR THE ASSETS REMAINING LIFE IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT ARE ESTIMATED FOR A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD

IN A LOAN LOSS RESERVE CALCULATION; FUTURE LOAN INCOME (INTEREST AND FEES)

IS INCORPORATED IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT IS GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED IN A LOAN LOSS RESERVE CALCULATION. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, SEE PAGES 171173 OF THIS NOTE.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. THE CARRYING

VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS

THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL THESE COMMITMENTS BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR NOTICE OR, IN SOME

CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF

TOTAL CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK RELATED TO STRUCTURED NOTES WERE $468

MILLION, $(1.7) BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE TOTALS INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR STRUCTURED NOTES CLASSIFIED WITHIN DEPOSITS

AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, AS WELL AS LONG-TERM DEBT. THE 2009 PRIOR PERIOD HAS BEEN REVISED.

(B)

STRUCTURED NOTES ARE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE TAILORED TO MEET A

CLIENTS NEED FOR DERIVATIVE RISK IN FUNDED FORM. THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE IS THE PRIMARY

DRIVER OF RISK. THE 2008 GAIN INCLUDED IN OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RESULTS FROM A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES WHERE THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE IS

PRINCIPALLY LINKED TO EITHER EQUITY INDICES OR COMMODITY PRICES, BOTH OF WHICH DECLINED

SHARPLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. ALTHOUGH THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRUCTURED

NOTES IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, THE GAINS REPORTED IN THIS TABLE DO NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME

STATEMENT IMPACT OF SUCH RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS.

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ELECTION

WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.



LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN VALUE

ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION

OF THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE

INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BOR-

ROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY INFORMATION, WHERE

AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.



LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE

DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD.



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL

BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A

RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC

CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

REMAINING CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL IS NOT APPLICABLE TO NONPRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES. UNLIKE

PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES, FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO

RETURN A STATED AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AT THE MATURITY OF THE NOTE, NONPRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES DO

NOT OBLIGATE THE FIRM TO RETURN A STATED AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AT MATURITY, BUT TO RETURN AN AMOUNT

BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR DERIVATIVE FEATURE EMBEDDED IN THE NOTE.

(B)

WHERE THE FIRM ISSUES PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED ZERO-COUPON OR DISCOUNT NOTES, THE BALANCE

REFLECTED AS THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL IS THE FINAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS $3.8 BILLION AND $3.7 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WITH A CORRESPONDING FAIR VALUE OF $6 MILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

NOTE 5  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES

THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS

SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS

NEEDED TO REFLECT MANAGEMENTS RISK TOLERANCE.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND

MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN SYNDICATION AND

PARTICIPATION, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS,

AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE

EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A KEY FOCUS ON TRENDS AND

CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL RISK CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH

CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY PARTICULAR LOAN PRODUCT (E.G., OPTION ARMS),

INDUSTRY SEGMENT (E.G., COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE) OR ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN

PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND

ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ONBALANCE SHEET CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS BY MAJOR PRODUCT AND/OR

GEOGRAPHY, SEE NOTES 14 AND 15 ON PAGES 220238 AND 239243, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CONCENTRATIONS OF OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS BY MAJOR PRODUCT, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES REPRESENTING PRIMARILY MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE CLIENTS OF

$32.5 BILLION AND $15.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, ARE INCLUDED IN THE

TABLE BELOW. THESE MARGIN LOANS ARE GENERALLY OVER-COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF ASSETS

MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A MAINTENANCE MARGIN

CALL IS MADE TO THE CLIENT TO

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 6  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO MODIFY OR MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET

RISKS. COUNTERPARTIES TO A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT SEEK TO OBTAIN RISKS AND REWARDS SIMILAR TO THOSE

THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM PURCHASING OR SELLING A RELATED CASH INSTRUMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO

EXCHANGE UPFRONT THE FULL PURCHASE OR SALES PRICE. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR

CUSTOMERS AND ALSO USES DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE ITS OWN MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. THE MAJORITY

OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES.

TRADING DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM MAKES MARKETS IN A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVES IN ITS TRADING PORTFOLIOS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS (BOTH DEALERS AND CLIENTS) AND TO GENERATE REVENUE THROUGH THIS TRADING ACTIVITY (CLIENT

DERIVATIVES). CUSTOMERS USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR MODIFY INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISKS. THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS FROM ITS EXPOSURE TO

THESE DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO OTHER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS OR BY PURCHASING OR SELLING OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET THE EXPOSURE FROM CLIENT DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM

ALSO SEEKS TO EARN A SPREAD BETWEEN THE CLIENT DERIVATIVES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, AND FROM THE

REMAINING OPEN RISK POSITIONS.

RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM MANAGES ITS MARKET RISK EXPOSURES USING VARIOUS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE AS

INTEREST RATES CHANGE. SIMILARLY, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASE OR DECREASE AS A RESULT OF

VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESETTING TO CURRENT MARKET RATES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE

REPAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENT ORIGINATION OR ISSUANCE OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT CURRENT

MARKET RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. THE FIRM GENERALLY

USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS

ON EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED (I.E., NON-U.S.) ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES

WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, THE U.S. DOLLAREQUIVALENT VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED REVENUE OR EXPENSE INCREASE OR DECREASE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

COMMODITIES BASED FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF CERTAIN

INVENTORY, INCLUDING GOLD AND BASE METALS, IN THE FIRMS COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO. GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THE FORWARDS AND FUTURES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE

DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION OF

THE RELATED INVENTORY. ALSO IN THE COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND

FORWARDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING AND

LOAD-SERVING CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN THE ENTITY REFERENCED

IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO PAY AN OBLIGATION

WHEN DUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVES SECTION ON PAGES 197199 OF THIS NOTE.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES GAINS

AND LOSSES TABLE ON PAGE 196 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, AND THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING GAINS AND LOSSES

TABLES ON PAGES 194195 OF THIS NOTE.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE. AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM NETS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE

RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PAID, WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT

EXISTS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A

DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

THE TABULAR DISCLOSURES ON PAGES 192199 OF THIS NOTE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT

OF, AND REPORTING FOR, DERIVATIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN STRUCTURED NOTES, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 ON PAGES 170187 AND 187189,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES 

GENERALLY INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD AND BASE METAL DERIVATIVES.

HOWEVER, JPMORGAN

CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN THE FIRMS RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO PURCHASED CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES

IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES. FOR THE SAME REASON, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ADDITION, FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A

HEDGE, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY MUST BE DOCUMENTED. HEDGE DOCUMENTATION MUST

IDENTIFY THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY OR FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND

TYPE OF RISK TO BE HEDGED, AND HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DERIVATIVE IS ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY

AND RETROSPECTIVELY.

TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION

ANALYSIS, AS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

191

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR-VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

THE

EXTENT TO WHICH A DERIVATIVE HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST

QUARTERLY. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EXACTLY OFFSET THE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

HEDGED RISK) MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS

NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATIONS: FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET

INVESTMENT HEDGES. JPMORGAN CHASE USES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM

DEBT, AFS SECURITIES AND GOLD AND BASE METAL INVENTORY. FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE, AND IN THE VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM, FOR THE RISK

BEING HEDGED, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR

VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE HEDGED

ITEM AND FOR INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT.

DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE

HEDGED ITEM  PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES CASH FLOW HEDGES TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM

FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. FOR

QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (OCI) AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS

AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM 

PRIMARILY INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, NONINTEREST REVENUE AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE

INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (AOCI) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED

AFFECT EARNINGS. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS

NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL HEDGE FORECAST, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE VALUES

RECORDED IN AOCI ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS NET INVESTMENTS IN

CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR

BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN AOCI.

IN 2010, THE REPORTING OF TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES WAS ENHANCED TO INCLUDE TRADING GAINS

AND LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN TRADING DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CREDIT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS INTRODUCED BY EACH DERIVATIVE CONTRACT TYPE, DERIVATIVES

EXPOSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO CREDIT RISK  THE RISK THAT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO MEET

THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND THE COLLATERAL, IF ANY, HELD BY THE

FIRM PROVES TO BE OF INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO COVER THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION. IT IS THE POLICY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE TO ENTER INTO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS TO ACTIVELY

PURSUE THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE AMOUNT

OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS

AT THEN-CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

WHILE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK, DERIVATIVE PAYABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO

LIQUIDITY RISK, AS THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO POST CASH OR SECURITIES

COLLATERAL WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS THE MARK-TO-MARKET

(MTM) OF THE CONTRACTS MOVES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES FAVOR, OR

UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THE FIRMS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS. CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF

EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE AGGREGATE

FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE PAYABLES THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES

TRIGGERED UPON A DOWNGRADE WAS $19.8 BILLION AND $22.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS POSTED COLLATERAL OF $14.6 BILLION AND $22.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE IMPACT OF A

SINGLE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES,

PRIMARILY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), WOULD HAVE

REQUIRED $1.9 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

$1.2 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM. IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

AND 2009, THE IMPACT OF SINGLE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADES TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PRIMARILY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH TERMINATION

TRIGGERS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE FIRM TO SETTLE TRADES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $430 MILLION AND $1.0

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND $260 MILLION AND $270 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION TO THE COLLATERAL AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

AND 2009, THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED LIQUID SECURITIES AND OTHER CASH COLLATERAL IN THE AMOUNT OF $16.5

BILLION AND $15.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND HAD POSTED $10.9 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ALSO RECEIVES AND DELIVERS COLLATERAL AT THE INITIATION OF DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS OR CLIENTS FAVOR, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE

FIRM AND ITS COUNTERPARTIES HOLD COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL

FREQUENCY FOR COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED, AND COLLATERAL THAT THE FIRM OR A COUNTERPARTY HAS AGREED TO

RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM

HAD RECEIVED $18.0 BILLION AND $16.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND DELIVERED $8.4 BILLION AND $5.8

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SUCH ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT NETTED AGAINST THE

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES IN THE TABLE ABOVE, BECAUSE, AT AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY

LEVEL, THE COLLATERAL EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD-PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE

PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT

DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS

THE PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY

EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY, A FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION OR A

RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION BUT HAS

THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT

EVENT.

THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND USES

THESE DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES. FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER IN THE

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS, THE FIRM ACTIVELY RISK MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY

PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE

NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. AS A SELLER OF PROTECTION, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN REFERENCE ENTITY MAY

BE OFFSET PARTIALLY, OR ENTIRELY, WITH A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE PROTECTION FROM ANOTHER COUNTERPARTY

ON THE SAME OR SIMILAR REFERENCE ENTITY. SECOND, THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OVERALL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT

LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AS WELL AS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES. IN ACCOMPLISHING THE ABOVE, THE FIRM USES

DIFFERENT TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (SINGLE-NAME) OR

A BROAD-BASED INDEX. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION ON BOTH SINGLE- NAME AND

INDEX-REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS. SINGLE-NAME CDS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY, WHILE INDEX CDS

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR CREDIT

MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND OTHER MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX COMPRISES A PORTFOLIO OF

CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE ENTITIES. NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE PERIODICALLY ESTABLISHED WITH A

NEW UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF

THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT

DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX. CDS CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF

REFERENCE NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR

EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST $1 MILLION OF REALIZED CREDIT LOSSES IN A $10

MILLION PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT,

UNDER THE TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE

ENTITY. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE FACE VALUE OF THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF

SETTLING THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER

DOES NOT NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTES

A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE IS A FUNDED CREDIT DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE

PURCHASES FROM THE NOTE INVESTOR CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCED ENTITY. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE

INVESTOR PAYS THE ISSUER THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN

RETURN, THE ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR, BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE

REFERENCED ENTITY. THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS

THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT. IF A CREDIT EVENT

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

197

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OCCURS, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS

THE INVESTOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED

REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY TO THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE HAS

RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT-RELATED NOTES, SEE

NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY RELATED TO CREDIT

DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE

ELECTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS IN THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. THE

RELATED CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT INCREASED RETAINED EARNINGS AND DECREASED ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY $15 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JULY 1, 2010.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND

CREDIT-RELATED NOTES THE FIRM SOLD AND PURCHASED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. UPON A CREDIT

EVENT,

THE FIRM AS SELLER OF PROTECTION WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE FULL

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF NET PROTECTION SOLD, AS THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE CONTRACTS

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. THE

FIRM MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH

IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES. OTHER PURCHASED PROTECTION REFERENCED IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, REFERENCE

POSITIONS (INCLUDING INDICES, PORTFOLIO COVERAGE AND OTHER REFERENCE POINTS) AS WELL AS PROTECTION

PURCHASED THROUGH CREDIT-RELATED NOTES.

THE FIRM DOES NOT USE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR CREDIT

DERIVATIVES, BECAUSE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABILITY OF THE

OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, OR RELATED CASH

INSTRUMENTS AND ECONOMIC HEDGES.

ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS.

THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONDUITS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE FIRMS NET INCOME AS A

WHOLE; HOWEVER, IT DID AFFECT THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ADVISORY FEES WERE CONSIDERED INTER-COMPANY AND

ELIMINATED, AND THE FEES CHARGED BY THE CONSOLIDATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS TO ITS CUSTOMERS

WERE CLASSIFIED AS LENDING-AND-DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME

THIS REVENUE CATEGORY PRIMARILY REFLECTS RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICESS (RFS) MORTGAGE BANKING REVENUE, INCLUDING: FEES AND INCOME

DERIVED FROM MORTGAGES ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL; MORTGAGE SALES AND SERVICING INCLUDING

LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY-SOLD LOANS; THE IMPACT OF RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORTGAGE PIPELINE, WAREHOUSE LOANS AND MSRS; AND REVENUE RELATED TO ANY

RESIDUAL INTERESTS HELD FROM MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS. THIS REVENUE CATEGORY ALSO INCLUDES GAINS

AND LOSSES ON SALES AND LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR MORTGAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE,

AS WELL AS CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL AND MEASURED

AT FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF RFS MORTGAGE SERVICING

RIGHTS ARE REPORTED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME. NET INTEREST INCOME FROM MORTGAGE LOANS,

AND SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES USED IN MORTGAGE-RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES), RESPECTIVELY.

FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSRS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 260263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME

THIS REVENUE CATEGORY INCLUDES INTERCHANGE INCOME FROM CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS. PRIOR TO 2010, THIS

REVENUE CATEGORY INCLUDED SERVICING FEES EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS (SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT) AND, AS A RESULT, THE SERVICING FEES WERE ELIMINATED IN

CONSOLIDATION. VOLUME-RELATED PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS AND EXPENSE FOR REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE NETTED

AGAINST INTERCHANGE INCOME; EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE REWARDS ARE

EARNED BY THE CUSTOMER. OTHER FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, EXCEPT FOR ANNUAL FEES, WHICH

ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE 12-MONTH PERIOD TO WHICH THEY

PERTAIN. DIRECT LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS ARE ALSO DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD.

IN

ADDITION, DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

THIS CATEGORY NOW INCLUDES NET FEES EARNED FOR PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS FOR MERCHANTS.

CREDIT CARD REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM HAS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH NUMEROUS AFFINITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CO-BRAND PARTNERS,

WHICH GRANT THE FIRM EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO MARKET TO THE MEMBERS OR CUSTOMERS OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS

AND PARTNERS. THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS ENDORSE THE CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE THEIR

MAILING LISTS TO THE FIRM, AND THEY MAY ALSO CONDUCT MARKETING ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDE AWARDS UNDER

THE VARIOUS CREDIT CARD PROGRAMS. THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM THREE TO 10

YEARS. THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THE FIRM PAYS TO THE ENDORSING ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS TYPICALLY

INCLUDE PAYMENTS BASED ON NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS, CHARGE VOLUMES, AND THE COST OF THE ENDORSING

ORGANIZATIONS OR PARTNERS MARKETING ACTIVITIES AND AWARDS.

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES THE PAYMENTS MADE TO THE AFFINITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CO-BRAND PARTNERS BASED ON

NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS AS DIRECT LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS. PAYMENTS BASED ON CHARGE VOLUMES ARE

CONSIDERED BY THE FIRM AS REVENUE SHARING WITH THE AFFINITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CO-BRAND PARTNERS,

WHICH ARE DEDUCTED FROM INTERCHANGE INCOME AS THE RELATED REVENUE IS

EARNED. PAYMENTS BASED ON

MARKETING EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE ENDORSING ORGANIZATION

OR PARTNER ARE EXPENSED BY THE FIRM AS

INCURRED. THESE COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN NONINTEREST EXPENSE.

NOTE 8  INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND

CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST

EXPENSE INCLUDES THE CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE, EXCEPT FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP ABSENT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTION; FOR THOSE

INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE RELATED

INTEREST IS INCLUDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE, AS APPLICABLE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 9  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB)

PLANS (COLLECTIVELY THE PLANS) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR

RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF

PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE

YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE

FIRM ANNOUNCED CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE PAY CREDIT SCHEDULE AND AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION

RECOGNIZED UNDER THE U.S. PLAN EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2010. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON

FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. ON JANUARY 15, 2009, AND AUGUST 28, 2009, THE FIRM MADE DISCRETIONARY CASH

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN OF $1.3 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2011 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS,

IF ANY, IS NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME. THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF 2011 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IS $166 MILLION OF WHICH $154 MILLION IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS

RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS ON COMPENSATION

AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN. THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT,

EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2009, PAY CREDITS WOULD NO LONGER BE PROVIDED ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE

MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

IN THE AMOUNT OF $266 MILLION AND $267 MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY PROVIDES TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER

SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN

CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO

TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT

OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN.

THE FIRM MATCHED ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (E.G.,

BASE PAY) ON A PER PAY PERIOD BASIS THROUGH APRIL 30, 2009, AND THEN AMENDED THE PLAN TO PROVIDE

THAT THEREAFTER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE MADE ANNUALLY. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A ONE-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH

COMPENSATION OF $250,000 OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED BEFORE MAY 1, 2009, AND WILL VEST AFTER

THREE YEARS OF SERVICE FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2009. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO

PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN

EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

EFFECTIVE AUGUST 10, 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BECAME THE SPONSOR OF THE WAMU SAVINGS PLAN

AND THAT PLAN'S  ASSETS WERE MERGED INTO THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2010.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF

SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS.

THE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO

ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI)

PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES,

COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE

THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE

U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

GAINS AND LOSSES

FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF

NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE

YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS 10% OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS, AS WELL

AS PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY NINE YEARS. FOR OPEB PLANS, ANY EXCESS NET GAINS AND

LOSSES ALSO ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIVE YEARS;

HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL

ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY THREE YEARS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES

ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED ON

HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL

EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE

SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED

EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR

RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO MIX OF EACH PLAN; AS A RESULT, IN 2010 THE FIRM GENERALLY

MAINTAINED THE SAME EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. THE

RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS

PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE RETURN ON AA-RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE

BONDS HAS BEEN TAKEN AS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON SUCH BONDS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES

AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED

FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN

WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE

REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED

AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS

REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS

BOND INDEX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUALIZED ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM DECREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET INTEREST

RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION FOR 2011. THE 2011

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN

ASSETS ARE 7.50% AND 6.25%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO 7.50% AND 7.00% IN 2010.

THE INITIAL

HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION DECLINED FROM 7.75% IN 2010 TO 7.00% IN 2011. THE

ULTIMATE HEALTH CARE TREND ASSUMPTION WILL REMAIN AT 5.00% IN 2011, BUT THE YEAR TO ULTIMATE WAS

ADJUSTED FROM 2014 TO 2017. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION AND

THE ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT 5.25% AND 4.00%, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD

CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS

WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE $30 MILLION IN 2011 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS

WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2011 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF

APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE $11 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF

APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE $169 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE

FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2011 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $76 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE

NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE 2011 NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE FIRMS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN A

WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (E.G., HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE

FUNDS). NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE ALSO

INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE

FIRMS COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD

IN SEPARATE

ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS.

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE

RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS AND GOALS USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS

ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER. PERIODICALLY THE FIRM

PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS,

INCORPORATING PROJECTED ASSET AND LIABILITY DATA, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SHORT-AND LONG-TERM IMPACT

OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION ON CUMULATIVE PENSION EXPENSE, ECONOMIC COST, PRESENT VALUE OF

CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDED STATUS. CURRENTLY, APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE: U.S. EQUITY

1535%, INTERNATIONAL EQUITY 1525%, DEBT SECURITIES 1030%, HEDGE FUNDS 1030%, REAL ESTATE

520%, AND PRIVATE EQUITY 520%. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT MANAGED TO A SPECIFIC TARGET BUT SEEK

TO SHIFT ASSET CLASS ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THESE STATED RANGES. ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. ASSET ALLOCATION DECISIONS ALSO INCORPORATE THE ECONOMIC

OUTLOOK AND ANTICIPATED IMPLICATIONS OF THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES

AND MANAGERS. MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS FOR CASH IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN THE ASSET ALLOCATION PROCESS. THE FIRM

REGULARLY REVIEWS THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ALL FACTORS THAT CONTINUOUSLY IMPACT THE PORTFOLIO,

WHICH IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS SUBJECT TO AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK RELATIVE TO THE PLANS LIABILITIES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY IN

RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PLANS LIABILITY PROFILES, THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS LARGEST

ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE TO DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROPRIATE DURATIONS. OTHER ASSETS, MAINLY EQUITY

SECURITIES, ARE THEN INVESTED FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT GROWTH.

SIMILAR TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, ASSET ALLOCATIONS FOR THE U.K. PLANS ARE REVIEWED

AND REBALANCED ON A REGULAR BASIS.

INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PLANS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH

AS INTEREST RATE, MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. EXPOSURE TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED

BY THE BROAD DIVERSIFICATION OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

INVESTMENTS IN EACH OF THE COMMON/

COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE FURTHER DIVERSIFIED INTO VARIOUS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION

WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS. THE PLANS HOLD INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE

SPONSORED OR MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION

FOR U.S. PLANS AND $155 MILLION AND $474 MILLION FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE PLANS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

THE FOLLOWING DETAILS THE INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION

OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDES CURRENCY ON HAND, DEMAND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, AND ANY SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH (I.E.,

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS).

DUE TO THE HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE OF

THESE ASSETS, THEY ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

EQUITY SECURITIES

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR MARKET ON WHICH

THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED AND ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED EXCHANGE PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, OTHER INDEPENDENT

PRICING OR BROKER QUOTES ARE CONSULTED FOR VALUATION PURPOSES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE

OF THE QUOTES (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY

TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK THAT DO NOT

HAVE QUOTED EXCHANGE PRICES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PUBLIC INVESTMENT VEHICLES VALUED BASED ON THE CALCULATED NAV OF THE FUND.

WHERE THE FUNDS PRODUCE A DAILY NAV THAT IS VALIDATED BY A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY

(PURCHASES AND SALES AT NAV), THE NAV IS USED TO VALUE THE FUND INVESTMENT AND IT IS CLASSIFIED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NAV ARE REQUIRED, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH

RESPECT TO INTERESTS IN FUNDS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTION (SUCH AS WITHDRAWAL

LIMITATIONS) AND/OR OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY FOR THE FUND INVESTMENT IS LIMITED, INVESTMENTS ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE

FUNDS. HEDGE FUNDS ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED NAV AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR EACH

INVESTMENT. CERTAIN OF THESE HEDGE FUND INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTION (SUCH

AS INITIAL LOCK-UP PERIODS, WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS AND ILLIQUID ASSETS) AND ARE THEREFORE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. THE VALUATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, THE INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS AND THEREFORE, THEY

ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO

PURCHASE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS FOR THE PLANS WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION FOR 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE VALUE OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION

PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE

NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET

ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO USE PRICING

MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. SUCH SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

MBS INCLUDE BOTH U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE (COLLECTIVELY,

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) SECURITIES, AND NONAGENCY PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES. U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED

IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. NONAGENCY SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY AAA RATED RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL MBS VALUED USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES AND THE

RELATIONSHIPS OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES. SUCH SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS. THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY ALSO BE USED IN LIEU OF INVESTING IN CASH

INSTRUMENTS. EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVES VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. HOWEVER, A MAJORITY OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND ARE

THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

OTHER

OTHER CONSISTS OF EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFS), MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS, AND PARTICIPATING AND

NON-PARTICIPATING ANNUITY CONTRACTS (ANNUITY CONTRACTS). ETFS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE

REPORTED ON THE MAJOR MARKET ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE

TRADED AND ARE GENERALLY

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING NAV.

THOSE FUND INVESTMENTS WITH A DAILY NAV THAT ARE VALIDATED BY A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE

ACTIVITY (PURCHASES AND SALES AT NAV) ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NAV ARE REQUIRED, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR FUND INVESTMENTS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON

REDEMPTION (SUCH AS LOCK-UP PERIODS OR WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS), AND/OR OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY FOR THE

FUND INVESTMENT IS LIMITED, THE MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY. ANNUITY CONTRACTS ARE VALUED AT THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

ASSETS HELD IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT EXCEEDS THE ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED GUARANTEED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION COVERED UNDER THE ANNUITY CONTRACTS. ANNUITY CONTRACTS LACK MARKET MECHANISMS FOR

TRANSFERRING EACH INDIVIDUAL POLICY AND GENERALLY INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TIMING OF SURRENDER;

THEREFORE, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

NOTE 10  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN 2010, 2009, AND 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2005 PLAN). THE 2005 PLAN BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON MAY 17, 2005, AND WAS AMENDED IN MAY 2008. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED 2005 PLAN, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, 113 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH MAY 2013.

THE AMENDED 2005 PLAN IS THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING

STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS. IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, THE 2005 PLAN, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND

PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE LTI PLANS, AND

SUCH PLANS CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT UPON THEIR GRANT. RSUS ARE

GENERALLY GRANTED ANNUALLY AND GENERALLY VEST AT A RATE OF 50% AFTER TWO YEARS AND 50% AFTER THREE

YEARS AND CONVERT INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION, RSUS TYPICALLY

INCLUDE FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON

VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS BASED ON AGE OR

SERVICE-RELATED REQUIREMENTS. ALL OF THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL VESTED. AN RSU

ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING

COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING AND, AS SUCH, ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING

SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 25 ON PAGE 269 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) HAVE GENERALLY BEEN

GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ON THE

GRANT DATE. THE FIRM TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR, AND IT ALSO

PERIODICALLY GRANTS DISCRETIONARY STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY

IN THE FORM OF BOTH EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS. THE 2010, 2009 AND 2008 GRANTS OF SARS TO KEY

EMPLOYEES VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS (I.E., 20% PER YEAR). THE 2010 GRANTS OF SARS CONTAIN

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS; THE 2009 AND 2008 GRANTS OF SARS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FULL-CAREER

ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS. SARS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A

SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. GENERALLY, FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED, COMPENSATION EXPENSE

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE

TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING

PERIOD. FOR AWARDS WITH FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS AND AWARDS GRANTED WITH NO FUTURE

SUBSTANTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENT, THE FIRM ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE

AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES AS OF THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF

POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL-CAREER

ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEES FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING

DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRMS POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS IS TO

ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, THE FIRM

SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO 2 MILLION SARS.

THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY

AWARDED BY THE FIRM. THE SARS, WHICH HAVE A 10-YEAR TERM, WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE NO EARLIER THAN

JANUARY 22, 2013, AND HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $39.83. THE NUMBER OF SARS THAT WILL BECOME

EXERCISABLE (RANGING FROM NONE TO THE FULL 2 MILLION) AND THEIR EXERCISE DATE OR DATES MAY BE

DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE

CEO AND JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM RECOGNIZES THIS AWARD RATABLY OVER AN ASSUMED FIVE-YEAR SERVICE

PERIOD, SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD THROUGH THE

GRANT DATE. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $4 MILLION, $9 MILLION AND $1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN

2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THIS AWARD.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, 46 MILLION BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS,

PRINCIPALLY RSUS, CAPITAL APPRECIATION PLAN UNITS AND STOCK OPTIONS, WERE EXCHANGED FOR EQUIVALENT

JPMORGAN CHASE AWARDS USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.21753. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE EMPLOYEE

STOCK AWARDS WAS INCLUDED IN THE BEAR STEARNS PURCHASE PRICE, SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE AWARDS

WERE FULLY VESTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MERGER DATE UNDER PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDED FOR ACCELERATED

VESTING UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF BEAR STEARNS. HOWEVER, BEAR STEARNS VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS HAD NO IMPACT ON THE PURCHASE PRICE; SINCE THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

OUT OF THE MONEY AT THE MERGER DATE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS WAS EQUAL TO ZERO UPON THEIR

CONVERSION INTO JPMORGAN CHASE OPTIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO EXCHANGED 6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR

27 MILLION SHARES OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK HELD IN AN IRREVOCABLE GRANTOR TRUST (THE RSU

TRUST), USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.21753. THE RSU

TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TO HOLD COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING AWARDS GRANTED TO SELECTED

EMPLOYEES AND KEY EXECUTIVES UNDER CERTAIN BEAR STEARNS

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. THE RSU TRUST WAS CONSOLIDATED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, AND THE SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST WERE RECORDED IN SHARES HELD IN

RSU TRUST, WHICH REDUCED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, SIMILAR TO THE TREATMENT FOR TREASURY STOCK. THE

RELATED OBLIGATION TO ISSUE STOCK UNDER THESE EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS IS REPORTED IN CAPITAL SURPLUS.

THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST TO EMPLOYEES HAS NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS TOTAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE. SHARES HELD IN THE RSU TRUST WERE

DISTRIBUTED IN 2008, 2009 AND 2010, WITH A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES IN THE RSU TRUST HAVING BEEN

DISTRIBUTED THROUGH DECEMBER 2010. THERE WERE 1 MILLION SHARES IN THE RSU TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010. THESE REMAINING SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DISTRIBUTED OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

RSU ACTIVITY

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED MULTIPLIED BY THE

STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 12  SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS,

HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING.

TRADING SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED PRIMARILY AS

AFS WHEN USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS OR USED FOR LONGER-TERM

STRATEGIC PURPOSES. AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE REPORTED AS NET

INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS). THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE

INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT THE

FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED

AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FIRM HAS NOT CLASSIFIED NEW PURCHASES OF

SECURITIES AS HTM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

AFS DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF THE FIRMS

ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI). FOR DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM

CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS AN OTTI TO HAVE

OCCURRED WHEN THERE IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS TO BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

THAT ARE RATED BELOW AA AT THEIR ACQUISITION, OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE

SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRM WOULD NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED INVESTMENT.

FOR AFS EQUITY SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF

IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT RECOVER ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

FOR DEBT SECURITIES, OTTI LOSSES MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IF AN INVESTOR HAS THE INTENT TO

SELL THE DEBT SECURITY, OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INVESTOR WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL

THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. HOWEVER, EVEN IF AN INVESTOR DOES

NOT EXPECT TO SELL A DEBT SECURITY, IT MUST EVALUATE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED AND

DETERMINE IF A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IN THE EVENT OF A CREDIT LOSS, ONLY THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. AMOUNTS RELATING TO FACTORS OTHER THAN

CREDIT LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN OCI.

WHEN THE FIRM INTENDS TO SELL AFS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, IT RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL

TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES.

WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL AFS DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION,

POTENTIAL OTTI IS CONSIDERED USING A

VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO

WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; ADVERSE CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE

INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A

SECURITY; PAYMENT STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY; CHANGES TO THE RATING OF THE SECURITY BY A RATING

AGENCY; THE VOLATILITY OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY AFTER

THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LIVES

OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL TO ASSESS WHETHER CREDIT LOSSES EXIST AND, WHERE APPLICABLE FOR

PURCHASED OR RETAINED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED ASSETS, TO DETERMINE IF ANY ADVERSE

CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS HAVE OCCURRED. THE FIRMS CASH FLOW ESTIMATES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPECTATIONS

OF RELEVANT MARKET AND ECONOMIC DATA AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. FOR SECURITIES ISSUED

IN A SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION UNDERLYING LOAN-LEVEL DATA, AND

STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE SECURITIZATION, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, EXCESS SPREAD,

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, AND COMPARES THE LOSSES PROJECTED FOR

THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (POOL LOSSES) AGAINST THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE

SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE POOL

LOSSES, OR WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS ON THE AFS DEBT SECURITY EXISTS. THE FIRM ALSO PERFORMS OTHER

ANALYSES TO SUPPORT ITS CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, SUCH AS FIRST-LOSS ANALYSES OR STRESS SCENARIOS.

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE ABOVE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS INTENT AND

ABILITY TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE, AND WHETHER EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT A REALIZABLE VALUE EQUAL TO OR

GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES

GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES HAVE GENERALLY DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2009, DUE PRIMARILY TO MARKET

SPREAD IMPROVEMENT AND INCREASED LIQUIDITY, DRIVING ASSET PRICES HIGHER. HOWEVER, GROSS UNREALIZED

LOSSES ON CERTAIN SECURITIES HAVE INCREASED, INCLUDING ON CERTAIN CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH

ARE PRIMARILY GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED POSITIONS THAT EXPERIENCED CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL THE SECURITIES WITH A LOSS POSITION IN AOCI,

AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY OF

THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS. EXCEPT FOR THE SECURITIES REPORTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR WHICH CREDIT

LOSSES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED

LOSS IN AOCI ARE NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL SECURITY INVESTMENTS WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

UNREALIZED LOSSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FIRMS ESTIMATE OF

THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS MOST LIKELY TO BE COLLECTED FROM THESE INVESTMENTS.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  PRIME AND ALT-A NONAGENCY

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO PRIME AND ALT-A RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY PRIVATE ISSUERS WERE $250 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IN

AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE. APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO (BY

AMORTIZED COST) ARE CURRENTLY RATED BELOW INVESTMENT-GRADE; THE FIRM HAS RECORDED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON 55% OF THE BELOW INVESTMENT-GRADE POSITIONS. IN ANALYZING

PRIME AND ALT-A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES FOR POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES, THE FIRM

UTILIZES A METHODOLOGY THAT FOCUSES ON LOAN-LEVEL DETAIL TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE

THEN ALLOCATED TO THE VARIOUS TRANCHES OF THE SECURITIES. THE LOAN-LEVEL ANALYSIS PRIMARILY

CONSIDERS CURRENT HOME VALUE, LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) RATIO, LOAN TYPE AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF

THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY TO FORECAST PREPAYMENT, HOME PRICE, DEFAULT RATE AND LOSS SEVERITY. THE

FORECASTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE UNDERLYING DEFAULT RATE ON THE POSITIONS WAS 21% AND THE RELATED

WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITY WAS 50%. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AN OTTI LOSS OF $6 MILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED IN 2010 RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT EXPERIENCED INCREASED DELINQUENCY RATES ASSOCIATED

WITH SPECIFIC COLLATERAL TYPES AND ORIGINATION DATES. OVERALL LOSSES HAVE DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER

31, 2009, WITH THE RECOVERY IN SECURITY PRICES RESULTING FROM INCREASED DEMAND FOR HIGHER-YIELDING

ASSET CLASSES AND A DECELERATION IN THE PACE OF HOME PRICE DECLINES DUE IN PART TO THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE FINANCING AND TO SPUR HOME PURCHASES. THE UNREALIZED LOSS OF $250

MILLION IS CONSIDERED TEMPORARY, BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS TOGETHER WITH THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT LEVELS FOR THOSE SECURITIES REMAIN SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT. THE CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BELOW INVESTMENT-GRADE AND

INVESTMENT-GRADE POSITIONS ARE 9% AND 24%, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO CLOS WERE $210 MILLION, OF WHICH $200

MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT WERE IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE.

OVERALL LOSSES HAVE DECREASED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2009, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF LOWER DEFAULT

FORECASTS AND SPREAD TIGHTENING ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES

ARE RATED AAA, AA AND A AND HAVE AN AVERAGE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF 30%. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN

CLOS IS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SUBORDINATION, WHICH IS A FORM OF STRUCTURAL CREDIT ENHANCEMENT

WHERE REALIZED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS HELD BY AN ISSUING VEHICLE ARE ALLOCATED TO ISSUED

TRANCHES CONSIDERING THEIR RELATIVE SENIORITY. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS CONSIDERED IN ANALYZING

POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES WERE UNDERLYING LOAN AND DEBT SECURITY DEFAULTS AND LOSS SEVERITY. BASED ON

CURRENT DEFAULT TRENDS, THE FIRM ASSUMED COLLATERAL DEFAULT RATES OF 2.1% FOR 2010 AND 5%

THEREAFTER. FURTHER, LOSS SEVERITIES WERE ASSUMED TO BE 48% FOR LOANS AND 78% FOR DEBT SECURITIES.

LOSSES ON COLLATERAL WERE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS AFTER DEFAULT.

WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID IN CONNECTION WITH

SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, SEE NOTES 4 ON PAGES 187189 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED

WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS; AND SECURITIES BORROWED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, FOR AGREEMENTS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND

INTEREST EXPENSE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER,

FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING

ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS THE FIRMS SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

INCLUDES REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF $4.1 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY $112.7 BILLION AND $121.2 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AGREEMENTS IN EFFECT THAT MEET THE

SPECIFIED CONDITIONS FOR NET PRESENTATION UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES POLICY IS TO TAKE POSSESSION, WHERE POSSIBLE, OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS AND OF SECURITIES BORROWED. THE FIRM MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES THAT

IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES AND EITHER REQUESTS

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR RETURNS A

PORTION OF THE COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES.

MARGIN LEVELS ARE ESTABLISHED INITIALLY BASED UPON THE COUNTERPARTY AND TYPE OF COLLATERAL AND

MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO PROTECT AGAINST DECLINES IN COLLATERAL VALUE IN THE EVENT OF

DEFAULT. JPMORGAN CHASE TYPICALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER COLLATERAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS RESALE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES BORROWED COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR

THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE PURCHASED OR BORROWED SECURITIES IN THE EVENT OF A CUSTOMER DEFAULT. AS

A RESULT OF THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES DESCRIBED ABOVE ON RESALE AND SECURITIES

BORROWED AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT

IMPAIRMENT ON THESE AGREEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF ASSETS PLEDGED AND COLLATERAL RECEIVED IN SECURITIES FINANCING

AGREEMENTS SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES 280281 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14  LOANS

LOAN ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENTS STRATEGY FOR THE LOAN, AND ON WHETHER THE LOAN

WAS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR LOANS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING

CATEGORIES.



ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

(PCI) LOANS);



LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE;



FAIR VALUE LOANS;



PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES A DETAILED ACCOUNTING DISCUSSION OF THESE LOAN CATEGORIES.

LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PCI LOANS)

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, ARE MEASURED AT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE FOLLOWING: ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; NET CHARGE-OFFS;

INTEREST APPLIED TO PRINCIPAL (FOR LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD); UNAMORTIZED

DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS; AND DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COST.

INTEREST INCOME

INTEREST INCOME ON PERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, IS ACCRUED AND

RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST. PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR

PREMIUMS, AS WELL AS NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE

LIFE OF THE LOAN TO PRODUCE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. LOANS (OTHER THAN

CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) ARE PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CONSIDERED NONPERFORMING WHEN FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN

DOUBT, WHICH IS GENERALLY DETERMINED WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND

COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE

PAST DUE WHEN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER BY THE CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED

DUE DATE OR FOR CERTAIN LOANS (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS), WHEN A MONTHLY PAYMENT IS DUE

AND UNPAID FOR 30 DAYS OR MORE. ALL INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST

INCOME AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED

AMOUNTS IS SUSPENDED. IN CERTAIN CASES, INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED TO

THE EXTENT CASH IS RECEIVED (I.E., CASH BASIS) WHEN THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE IS DEEMED FULLY

COLLECTIBLE; HOWEVER, IF THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF THE RECORDED LOAN

BALANCE, ALL INTEREST CASH RECEIPTS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOAN (THE COST

RECOVERY METHOD).

A LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THERE HAS BEEN

DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE TERMS OF THE

RESTRUCTURED LOAN.

AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM BEING PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS; ACCORDINGLY, INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE

UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. HOWEVER, THE FIRM SEPARATELY ESTABLISHES AN

ALLOWANCE FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF BILLED AND ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME ON

CREDIT CARD LOANS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABLE LOSSES ON HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT

LOANS. CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 239243 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ON THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICES FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CHARGE-OFFS

WHOLESALE LOANS AND RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED. THIS

DETERMINATION INCLUDES MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRMS CLAIM IN

BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN AND VALUATION OF THE BORROWERS

EQUITY.

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS AND PCI LOANS, ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (FFIEC) POLICY.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED DOWN TO

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT NO LATER THAN 180 DAYS PAST DUE. CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS,

INCLUDING AUTO LOANS AND NON-GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED STUDENT LOANS, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED DOWN TO

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. THE FIRM REGULARLY ASSESSES THE ASSUMPTIONS

THAT IT USES TO ESTIMATE THESE NET REALIZABLE VALUES, AND UPDATES THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AS

NECESSARY TO FURTHER REFINE ITS ESTIMATES.

CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS

PAST DUE, OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION ABOUT A SPECIFIED EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY

OF THE BORROWER), WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

CERTAIN IMPAIRED LOANS ARE DEEMED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT BECAUSE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO

BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, RATHER THAN BY CASH FLOWS FROM THE BORROWERS

OPERATIONS, INCOME OR OTHER RESOURCES. IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED-OFF TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL.

SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 239243 FOR INFORMATION ON

THE FIRMS CHARGE-OFF AND VALUATION POLICIES FOR COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES

RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON AN INDIVIDUAL

LOAN BASIS. FOR CONSUMER LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS.

INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF

INTEREST.

LOAN ORIGINATION FEES OR COSTS AND PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE DEFERRED IN A CONTRA

LOAN ACCOUNT UNTIL THE RELATED LOAN IS SOLD. THE DEFERRED FEES AND DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE AN

ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASIS OF THE LOAN AND THEREFORE ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIODIC DETERMINATION OF THE

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND/OR THE GAIN OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NONACCRUAL POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BECAUSE HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

FAIR VALUE LOANS

LOANS USED IN A TRADING STRATEGY OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE,

WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

FOR THESE LOANS, THE EARNED CURRENT CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAYMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST INCOME.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED

UPFRONT IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE

CATEGORY AS INCURRED.

BECAUSE THESE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRMS NONACCRUAL, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 187189 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS ELECTIONS

OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. SEE NOTE 3 AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 170187 AND

187189 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

PCI LOANS

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. PCI LOANS HAVE EVIDENCE OF

CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE THE LOANS ORIGINATION DATE AND THEREFORE IT IS PROBABLE, AT

ACQUISITION, THAT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE COLLECTED. BECAUSE PCI LOANS ARE

INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES, NO ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO PCI LOANS IS RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION

DATE.

SEE PAGE 233 OF THIS NOTE

FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING FOR PCI LOANS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION.

LOAN CLASSIFICATION CHANGES

LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE

HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES

OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES, LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN

ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE

OF TRANSFER. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE

METHODOLOGY.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

THE FIRM SEEKS TO MODIFY CERTAIN LOANS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. THROUGH

THE MODIFICATION, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS ONE OR MORE CONCESSIONS TO A BORROWER WHO IS EXPERIENCING

FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE FIRMS ECONOMIC LOSS, AVOID FORECLOSURE OR

REPOSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL AND TO ULTIMATELY MAXIMIZE PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM FROM THE

BORROWER. THE CONCESSIONS GRANTED VARY BY PROGRAM AND BY BORROWER-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAY

INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM EXTENSIONS, PAYMENT DEFERRALS, OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF EQUITY

OR OTHER ASSETS IN LIEU OF PAYMENTS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, LOAN MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE

PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS.

SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRS). A LOAN

THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED UNTIL IT MATURES, IS REPAID,

OR IS OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BORROWER PERFORMS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS.

IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE MODIFIED LOAN IS AT OR

ABOVE THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AT THE TIME OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ASSUMING

THAT THE LOAN SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMS UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS AND THE FIRM EXPECTS TO COLLECT ALL

CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS, THE LOAN IS DISCLOSED AS IMPAIRED AND AS A TDR ONLY

DURING THE YEAR OF THE MODIFICATION; IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, THE LOAN IS NOT DISCLOSED AS AN IMPAIRED

LOAN OR AS A TDR SO LONG AS REPAYMENT OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

LOANS, EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, MODIFIED IN A TDR ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS,

ALTHOUGH IN MOST CASES SUCH LOANS WERE ALREADY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. THESE

LOANS MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS (RESUMING THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST) IF THE FOLLOWING

CRITERIA ARE MET: (A) THE BORROWER HAS PERFORMED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX

MONTHS AND/OR SIX PAYMENTS, AND (B) THE FIRM HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE MODIFIED LOAN

IS REASONABLY ASSURED BASED ON, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BORROWERS DEBT CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF FUTURE

EARNINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES, LTV RATIOS, AND OTHER CURRENT MARKET CONSIDERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

221

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BECAUSE TDRS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THESE LOANS ARE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

ALLOWANCE, WHICH CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES FOR THE MODIFIED LOANS AND IS DETERMINED

BASED ON THE SAME METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE COMPONENT

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOAN IS PERFORMING AND HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS.

FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, SEE NOTE 15 ON

PAGES 239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES.

PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, LAND, BUILDINGS, AND

FIXTURES) AND COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (E.G., AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS).

AT THE TIME JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES PHYSICAL POSSESSION, THE PROPERTY IS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO FAIR

VALUE ARE CHARGED/CREDITED TO NONINTEREST REVENUE. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND

MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE FIRM'S

LOAN PORTFOLIO IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE

THE SAME SEGMENTS USED BY THE FIRM TO DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: WHOLESALE; CONSUMER,

EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD; AND CREDIT CARD. WITHIN EACH PORTFOLIO SEGMENT, THE FIRM MONITORS AND

ASSESSES THE CREDIT RISK IN THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF LOANS, BASED ON

THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH LOAN CLASS.

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO

WHOLESALE LOANS INCLUDE LOANS MADE TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO CERTAIN HIGH-NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR WHOLESALE LOANS IS THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED EACH LOAN.

RISK RATINGS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS AND DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE

PORTFOLIO. RISK RATINGS ON LOANS CONSIDER THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (PD) AND THE LOSS GIVEN

DEFAULT (LGD). PD IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL NOT BE REPAID AT DEFAULT. THE LGD IS THE

ESTIMATED LOSS ON THE LOAN THAT WOULD BE REALIZED UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE BORROWER AND TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE RISK RATING, INCLUDING THE

OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT

AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE

INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. RISK RATINGS GENERALLY REPRESENT RATINGS

PROFILES SIMILAR TO THOSE DEFINED BY S&P AND

MOODYS. INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS RANGE FROM AAA/AAA

TO BBB-/BAA3. NONINVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS ARE FURTHER

CLASSIFIED AS NONCRITICIZED (BB+/BA1 AND B-/B3) AND CRITICIZED (CCC+/CAA1 AND LOWER), AND THE

CRITICIZED PORTION IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO PERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS, REPRESENTING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CRITICIZED LOANS HAVE A

HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN NONCRITICIZED LOANS.

RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE

ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATIONS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE RISK RATING OF A LOAN CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR CONDUCTS ITS

OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THE OVERALL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON THE

MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND CLIENT EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID

TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERN. SEE NOTE 5 ON

PAGES 189190 IN THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR FURTHER DETAIL ON INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL ESTATE

CLASS OF LOANS WITHIN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO SEGMENT FOR THE

PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. THE REAL ESTATE CLASS PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SECURED

COMMERCIAL LOANS MAINLY TO BORROWERS FOR MULTI-FAMILY AND COMMERCIAL LESSOR PROPERTIES.

MULTI-FAMILY LENDING SPECIFICALLY FINANCES APARTMENT BUILDINGS. COMMERCIAL LESSORS RECEIVE

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. UPON

ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED $4.8 BILLION OF CERTAIN CONSUMER LOAN

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, PRIMARILY MORTGAGE-RELATED. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DELINQUENCY RATES ARE A PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CONSUMER LOANS. LOANS THAT ARE MORE

THAN 30 DAYS PAST DUE PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING OF BORROWERS THAT MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND/OR WHO MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO REPAY THE LOAN. AS THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE,

IT BECOMES MORE CLEAR THAT THE BORROWER IS LIKELY EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. IN THE CASE OF

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (GREATER THAN 150 DAYS PAST DUE) ARE A

STRONG INDICATOR OF LOANS

THAT WILL

ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A SHORT SALE OR FORECLOSURE. IN ADDITION TO

DELINQUENCY RATES, OTHER CREDIT

QUALITY INDICATORS FOR CONSUMER LOANS VARY BASED ON THE CLASS OF LOAN, AS FOLLOWS.



FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, INCLUDING BOTH NON-PCI AND PCI PORTFOLIOS, THE CURRENT

ESTIMATED LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) RATIO, OR THE COMBINED LTV RATIO IN THE CASE OF LOANS WITH A

JUNIOR LIEN, IS AN INDICATOR OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS SEVERITY IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT.

ADDITIONALLY, LTV OR COMBINED LTV CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO A BORROWERS CONTINUED WILLINGNESS

TO PAY, AS THE DELINQUENCY RATE OF HIGH-LTV LOANS TENDS TO BE GREATER THAN THAT FOR LOANS

WHERE THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOAN

COLLATERAL ALSO PROVIDES IN-SIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO, AS FACTORS SUCH

AS THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, HOME PRICE CHANGES AND SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS HURRICANES,

EARTHQUAKES, ETC. WILL AFFECT CREDIT QUALITY. THE BORROWERS CURRENT OR REFRESHED FICO SCORE

IS A SECONDARY CREDIT-QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CERTAIN LOANS, AS FICO SCORES ARE AN INDICATION OF

THE BORROWERS CREDIT PAYMENT HISTORY. THUS, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A LOW FICO SCORE (660

OR BELOW) IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF HIGHER RISK THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH FICO SCORE.

FURTHER, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A LOW FICO SCORE IS AT GREATER RISK OF

DEFAULT THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER THAT HAS BOTH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A HIGH FICO SCORE.



FOR AUTO, SCORED BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LOANS,

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION IS AN

INDICATOR OF THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SIMILAR TO RESIDENTIAL REAL

ESTATE LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE BASED

ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EVENTS.



RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS ARE SIMILAR TO WHOLESALE LOANS IN THAT THE

PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS ARE THE RISK RATING THAT IS ASSIGNED TO THE LOAN AND WHETHER THE

LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICIZED AND/OR NONACCRUAL. RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND

ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION

AFFECTING BORROWERS ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER CLASSES OF

CONSUMER LOANS, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE PORTFOLIO PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO PORTFOLIO

PERFORMANCE BASED ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EVENTS.

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE IMPAIRED LOANS AND LOAN

MODIFICATIONS

 EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURYS MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (MHA) PROGRAMS AND IS

CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO

NOT QUALIFY FOR THE MHA PROGRAMS.

MHA, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS, GENERALLY PROVIDE VARIOUS CONCESSIONS TO

FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BORROWERS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM OR

PAYMENT EXTENSIONS AND DEFERRAL OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT. PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC

MODIFICATION PROGRAM FOR OPTION ARMS.

GENERALLY, BORROWERS MUST MAKE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS UNDER THE REVISED CONTRACTUAL TERMS DURING A

TRIAL MODIFICATION AND BE SUCCESSFULLY RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE A MORTGAGE

OR HOME EQUITY LOAN CAN BE PERMANENTLY MODIFIED. WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT

IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE

CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION.

MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS OTHER THAN PCI LOANS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AND

REPORTED AS TDRS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND TDRS, SEE

LOAN MODIFICATIONS ON PAGES 221222 OF THIS NOTE.

THE TABLES BELOW SET FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE IMPAIRED

LOANS, EXCLUDING PCI. THESE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED AS THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A

TDR. ALL IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 ON

PAGES 239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SUBSEQUENT TO REPURCHASE FROM GINNIE MAE WERE EXCLUDED FROM LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AS TDRS. WHEN

SUCH LOANS PERFORM SUBSEQUENT TO MODIFICATION THEY ARE GENERALLY SOLD BACK INTO GINNIE MAE

LOAN POOLS. MODIFIED LOANS THAT DO NOT RE-PERFORM BECOME SUBJECT TO FORECLOSURE. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE INSURED AND, WHERE APPLICABLE,

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED AMOUNTS IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

(E)

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

PCI LOANS WERE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED UPON ACQUISITION BASED ON SPECIFIC RISK

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOAN, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, FICO SCORES, AND

PAST-DUE STATUS. UPON ACQUISITION, CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER MAY BE

AGGREGATED INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A POOL

IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE

EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ALL OF THE CONSUMER

LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UPON ACQUISITION. FOR EACH PCI LOAN, OR POOL OF

LOANS, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST) EXPECTED

TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LOAN OR POOL. THESE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND

OTHER FACTORS THAT REFLECT THEN-CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE EXCESS OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS

IS REFERRED TO AS THE ACCRETABLE YIELD. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT REPORTED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS BUT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE REMAINING

ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF LOANS. FOR VARIABLE-RATE LOANS, EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS WERE INITIALLY BASED ON THE RATE IN EFFECT AT ACQUISITION; EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE

RECALCULATED AS RATES CHANGE OVER THE LIVES OF THE LOANS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE FIRM UPDATES THE AMOUNT OF LOAN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED LOAN PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS TRIGGER THE

RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL

LOSS PLUS ANY RELATED FOREGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT THE POOLS EFFECTIVE INTEREST

RATE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (E.G., DECREASED PRINCIPAL CREDIT LOSSES, THE NET

BENEFIT OF MODIFICATIONS) WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

WITH ANY REMAINING INCREASES RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT OVER THE REMAINING

ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS. THE IMPACTS OF (I) PRE-

PAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE

INTEREST RATES, AND (III) ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED

PROSPECTIVELY AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME. DISPOSALS OF LOANS

 WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF

LOANS, RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS IN FULL BY THE BORROWER, OR FORECLOSURE

 RESULT IN REMOVAL OF THE LOAN

FROM THE PCI PORTFOLIO.

IF THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON PCI LOANS WERE DETERMINED NOT TO BE

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO INTEREST WOULD BE ACCRETED AND THE LOANS WOULD BE REPORTED AS NONACCRUAL

LOANS; HOWEVER, SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRMS PCI CONSUMER

LOANS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, INTEREST IS BEING ACCRETED AND THE LOANS ARE BEING REPORTED AS

PERFORMING LOANS.

CHARGE-OFFS ARE NOT RECORDED ON PCI LOANS UNTIL ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED THE ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE

RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT ACQUISITION DATE. TO DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN

RECORDED FOR THESE CONSUMER LOANS.

THE PCI PORTFOLIO AFFECTS THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH: (I) CONTRIBUTION TO

NET INTEREST MARGIN; (II) EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFAULTS AND SERVICING RESULTING FROM THE LIQUIDATION

OF THE LOANS; AND (III) ANY PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE FUNDED BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOANS. FOR

EXAMPLE, VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH VARIABLE-RATE LIABILITIES AND FIXED-RATE LOANS WERE

FUNDED WITH FIXED-RATE LIABILITIES WITH A SIMILAR MATURITY PROFILE. A NET SPREAD WILL BE EARNED

ON THE DECLINING BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, TO HAVE A REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 7.0 YEARS.

THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO MODIFY CERTAIN PCI LOANS.

THE IMPACT OF THESE MODIFICATIONS IS INCORPORATED

INTO THE FIRMS QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS HAS OCCURRED, AND THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS PCI LOANS.

THE IMPACT OF MODIFICATIONS ON EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ESTIMATED USING THE FIRMS EXPERIENCE WITH

PREVIOUSLY MODIFIED LOANS AND OTHER RELEVANT DATA. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE

OF MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES AND/OR REFINES ASSUMPTIONS AS EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

OR DATA WARRANT.

OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO

REFINE ITS CASH FLOW MODEL AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES MODEL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WERE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY

CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS

RECLASSIFICATION TO THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE. SUCH CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE AN

INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE.

THE FACTORS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ESTIMATES OF GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED, AND ACCORDINGLY THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE, INCLUDE: (I) CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE INDICES FOR VARIABLE RATE PRODUCTS SUCH AS OPTION ARM AND HOME

EQUITY LOANS; AND (II) CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS.

TO DATE, THE DECREASE IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE

IN INTEREST RATES ON

VARIABLE-RATE LOANS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION

PERIODS. CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS, AFFECT THE TIMING OF EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS BUT NOT THE AMOUNT OF CASH EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED (I.E., THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE).

EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS REDUCE THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE BECAUSE THE SAME

ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE IS RECOGNIZED AGAINST A HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOAN BALANCE OVER A

LONGER-THAN-EXPECTED PERIOD OF TIME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT CARD LOANS

THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SEGMENT INCLUDES CREDIT CARD LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED BY THE FIRM,

INCLUDING THOSE ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. DELINQUENCY RATES ARE THE PRIMARY

CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS AS THEY PROVIDE AN

EARLY WARNING THAT BORROWERS MAY BE

EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES (30-DAYS PAST DUE), AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON THOSE BORROWERS THAT

HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME (90-DAYS PAST DUE). IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY

RATES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOANS PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY.

THE BORROWERS CREDIT SCORE IS ANOTHER GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY. BECAUSE THE BORROWERS

CREDIT SCORE TENDS TO BE A LAGGING INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM DOES NOT USE CREDIT SCORES

AS A PRIMARY INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY. HOWEVER, THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SCORES PROVIDES A

GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. REFRESHED FICO SCORE INFORMATION

FOR A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO IS INDICATED IN THE

TABLE BELOW, AS FICO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE

INDUSTRY BENCHMARK FOR CREDIT SCORES.

THE FIRM GENERALLY ORIGINATES NEW CARD ACCOUNTS TO PRIME CONSUMER BORROWERS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

CARDHOLDERS REFRESHED FICO SCORES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, DEPENDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

CARDHOLDER AND CHANGES IN CREDIT SCORE TECHNOLOGY.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT CARD IMPAIRED LOANS

JPMORGAN

CHASE MAY OFFER ONE OF A NUMBER OF LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO

CREDIT CARD BORROWERS WHO ARE

EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. THE FIRM HAS SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO MAY BE IN

NEED OF TEMPORARY RELIEF, AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A MORE

FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MOST OF THE FIRMS MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS HAVE

BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THE LONG-TERM PROGRAMS. MODIFICATIONS UNDER THE FIRMS LONG-TERM PROGRAMS

INVOLVE PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. MODIFICATIONS UNDER

ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CARD. ALSO IN ALL CASES,

THE FIRM CANCELS THE CUSTOMERS AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT ON THE

CREDIT CARD.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

THESE MODIFICATIONS, BOTH LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM ARE CONSIDERED TO BE TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS.

IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN

AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS.

ASSUMING THAT THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT

BEGIN TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PAYMENT TERMS, THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE AND WILL

ULTIMATELY BE CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY.

IN ADDITION, IF A BORROWER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THEN THE LOAN REVERTS BACK

TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT REINSTATE THE

BORROWERS LINE OF CREDIT.

THE FIRM

MEASURES THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOANS LOSSES RELATED TO IMPAIRED CREDIT CARD LOANS AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOANS ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL

INTEREST RATE AND, THEREFORE, DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY INCREMENTAL PENALTY RATE IN THIS MEASUREMENT.

THE TABLES BELOW SET FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRMS IMPAIRED CREDIT CARD LOANS. ALL OF THESE

LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED AS THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS.

REVERTED BACK TO THE PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS OF THE LOANS DUE TO NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE

TERMS OF THE MODIFIED LOANS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE LOANS IS EXPECTED TO BE

CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. THE REMAINING $590

MILLION OF LOANS ARE TO BORROWERS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION

THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 15  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER,

INCLUDING CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF

PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE

FOR WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING METHODOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED TO

COMPUTE THE ALLOWANCE ON THE UNDERLYING LOANS. DURING 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES USED TO DETERMINE ITS

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT AND A

COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, WHICH INCLUDES LOANS THAT

HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING AS WELL AS RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE

LOANS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, THE LOANS OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) IS LOWER

THAN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE,

LARGER LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE SMALLER LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS POOLS USING

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. RISK-RATED LOANS (PRIMARILY

WHOLESALE LOANS) ARE POOLED BY RISK RATING, WHILE SCORED LOANS (I.E., CONSUMER LOANS) ARE POOLED BY

PRODUCT TYPE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MEASURES THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED

INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED

AT THE LOANS ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN IMPAIRMENT DUE TO

THE IMPACT OF DISCOUNTING ARE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES, NOT AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST INCOME. AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR AN IMPAIRED LOAN THAT IS DETERMINED

USING AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN

THE LOAN AND THE LOANS FAIR VALUE.

CERTAIN LOANS ARE DEEMED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT BECAUSE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE

PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, RATHER THAN BY CASH FLOWS FROM THE BORROWERS

OPERATIONS, INCOME OR OTHER RESOURCES. IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED-OFF TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, LESS COSTS TO SELL, RATHER THAN BEING SUBJECT TO AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

RESERVE AS FOR OTHER IMPAIRED LOANS.

THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL (E.G.,

SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE). IN CASES WHERE THE COLLATERAL IS IN THE FORM OF LIQUID SECURITIES, THE

FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR BROKER QUOTES. FOR ILLIQUID SECURITIES OR OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL.

FOR

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON

EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. WHEN IT BECOMES LIKELY THAT A BORROWER IS

EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY, THE FIRM OBTAINS A BROKER'S PRICE

OPINION OF THE HOME BASED ON AN EXTERIOR-ONLY VALUATION

(EXTERIOR OPINIONS). AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER TAKING

PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY THROUGH FORECLOSURE, THE FIRM

OBTAINS AN APPRAISAL BASED ON

AN

INSPECTION THAT INCLUDES THE

INTERIOR OF THE HOME (INTERIOR APPRAISALS). EXTERIOR

OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS ARE DISCOUNTED BASED UPON THE FIRM'S

EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES AS COMPARED TO THE

ESTIMATED VALUES PROVIDED BY EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR

APPRAISALS, CONSIDERING STATE- AND PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, THE COLLATERAL VALUE IS GENERALLY BASED ON APPRAISALS FROM

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. COLLATERAL VALUES ARE TYPICALLY UPDATED EVERY SIX TO

TWELVE MONTHS, EITHER BY OBTAINING A NEW APPRAISAL OR BY PERFORMING AN INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS POLICIES. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS BOTH BORROWER- AND MARKET-SPECIFIC

FACTORS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OBTAINING APPRAISAL UPDATES OR BROKER PRICE OPINIONS AT MORE FREQUENT

INTERVALS.

SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY FOR IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION TO PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE PRINCIPAL

LOSSES INHERENT IN PERFORMING RISK-RATED LOANS AND CONSUMER LOANS, EXCEPT FOR LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS AND PCI LOANS. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR

MORE INFORMATION ON PCI LOANS.

FOR RISK-RATED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT AND AN ESTIMATED LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY

RISK RATING AND EXPECTED MATURITY. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE

FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE

OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES,

MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS

ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT

AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD

IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE

EXTERNAL THROUGH-THE-CYCLE DATA, USING CREDIT-RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE

BASED ON THE FIRMS HISTORY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE.

FOR SCORED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS PERFORMED ON POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK

CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., PRODUCT TYPE) AND GENERALLY COMPUTED AS THE PRODUCT OF ACTUAL OUTSTANDINGS,

AN EXPECTED-LOSS FACTOR AND AN ESTIMATED-LOSS COVERAGE PERIOD. EXPECTED-LOSS FACTORS ARE

STATISTICALLY DERIVED AND CONSIDER HISTORICAL FACTORS SUCH AS LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY. IN

DEVELOPING LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS, THE FIRM CONSIDERS KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HOUSING PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND

OTHER RISK INDICATORS.

A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURE IS USED TO DEVELOP LOSS SEVERITY ESTIMATES ON

DEFAULTED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSA) LEVEL. THESE

LOSS SEVERITY ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY VALIDATED BY COMPARISON TO ACTUAL LOSSES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RECOGNIZED ON DEFAULTED LOANS,

MARKET-SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS AND PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY. REAL ESTATE BROKER PRICE

OPINIONS ARE OBTAINED WHEN THE LOAN IS BEING EVALUATED FOR CHARGE-OFF

AND AT LEAST EVERY SIX MONTHS

THEREAFTER. WHEN FORECLOSURE IS DETERMINED TO BE PROBABLE, A THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL IS OBTAINED AS

SOON AS PRACTICABLE. FORECASTING METHODS ARE USED TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED-LOSS FACTORS, INCLUDING

CREDIT LOSS FORECASTING MODELS AND VINTAGE-BASED LOSS FORECASTING.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE

TYPE AND RESULTS OF SUCH

MODIFICATIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 220238 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, MODIFIED

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS UPON

CONTRACTUAL MODIFICATION AND ARE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO

MODIFICATION. ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LOANS EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK TO ADJUST THE RESULTS OF APPLYING THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT IS BASED

ON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS

FACTORS AND THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, ANY

ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ALSO CONSIDER CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING

INDUSTRIES. FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT.

FACTORS RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT, HOUSING PRICES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR

AND LIEN POSITION ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION, WHERE

RELEVANT.

MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT

ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

THE FIRMS OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED WITH VIES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT, AS

FOLLOWS.



ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM): SPONSORS AND MANAGES A LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT ARE DEEMED

VIES. AS ASSET MANAGER OF THE FUNDS, AM

EARNS A FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS

COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FUND ENTITIES THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AMS INTERESTS

ARE, IN CERTAIN CASES, CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION

OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE ENTITIES.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES (TSS): PROVIDES SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR THE SERVICES IT

PROVIDES. TSSS INTERESTS ARE GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS

AND/OR DO NOT CONTROL THESE VIES; THEREFORE, TSS DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE VIES.



COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB): CB MAKES INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES LENDING TO COMMUNITY

DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES THAT MAY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE. IN ADDITION, CB PROVIDES FINANCING

AND LENDING RELATED SERVICES TO CERTAIN CLIENT SPONSORED VIES. IN GENERAL, CB DOES NOT CONTROL

THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES.



CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY: CORPORATE USES VIES TO ISSUE GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES.

SEE NOTE 22 ON PAGES 265266 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THE PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS, WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT ARE

DEEMED VIES. HOWEVER, THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SPECIALIZED INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACCOUNTING, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATION OF INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VIES.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN AND PROVIDES FINANCING AND OTHER SERVICES TO VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD

PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 253 OF THIS NOTE.

JUSTMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. THE IMPACT TO

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY ALSO INCLUDES A DECREASE TO AOCI OF $116 MILLION, AS A RESULT OF THE

REVERSAL OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN ON RETAINED AFS SECURITIES THAT WERE ELIMINATED

IN CONSOLIDATION.

(B)

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WHICH WERE

CONSOLIDATED WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT THEIR CARRYING VALUES, PRIMARILY AMORTIZED COST, AS

THIS METHOD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BUSINESSS INTENT TO HOLD THE ASSETS FOR THE LONGER-TERM.

THE ASSETS ARE RECORDED PRIMARILY IN LOANS AND IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

(C)

RFS CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN A NET

INCREASE IN BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $4.7 BILLION ($3.5 BILLION RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AND $1.2 BILLION RELATED TO OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS). THESE

ASSETS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT THEIR UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND RECORDED PRIMARILY IN

LOANS ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THIS METHOD WAS ELECTED AS A PRACTICAL

EXPEDIENT.

(D)

IB CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN MORTGAGE AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN A NET

INCREASE IN BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $4.3 BILLION ($3.7 BILLION RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AND $0.6 BILLION RELATED TO OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS). THESE

ASSETS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE, AS THIS METHOD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

APPROACH THAT IB UTILIZES TO MANAGE SIMILAR ASSETS. THESE ASSETS WERE RECORDED PRIMARILY IN

TRADING ASSETS ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

(E)

THE U.S. GAAP CONSOLIDATION OF THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE ADOPTION DATE BECAUSE THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE FIRMS

PRIMARY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST) HAD BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES

BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $40.0 BILLION OF RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ELECTED A TWO-QUARTER REGULATORY

IMPLEMENTATION DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND

RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS PERMITTED FOR ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND

CERTAIN MORTGAGE-RELATED AND OTHER SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. THE DEFERRAL PERIOD ENDED JULY 1, 2010,

AND THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED, FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES, THE DEFERRED AMOUNTS, WHICH HAD A

NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS.

SIGNIFICANT FIRM-SPONSORED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD SERVICES (CS) BUSINESS SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS, PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE TRUST). THE FIRMS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST IN THE

RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND MAINTAINING ESCROW ACCOUNTS. AS SERVICER, THE FIRM RECEIVES CONTRACTUAL SERVICING FEES BASED ON THE SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE

PLUS EXCESS SERVICING FEES, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN CREDIT CARD INCOME AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 ON PAGE 200 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF FIRM-SPONSORED

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, INCLUDING ITS PRIMARY CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST, CHASE ISSUANCE

TRUST, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE CONSOLIDATION

DETERMINATION WAS BASED ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH ITS

SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER

DUTIES, INCLUDING MAKING DECISIONS AS TO THE RECEIVABLES THAT

ARE TRANSFERRED INTO THOSE TRUSTS AND AS TO

ANY RELATED MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRMS OTHER

CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUSTS, AS INDICATED ABOVE, OBLIGATES THE FIRM TO ABSORB LOSSES AND

GIVES THE FIRM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THESE VIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

SIGNIFICANT.

UPON CONSOLIDATION AT JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM RECORDED A NET INCREASE IN GAAP ASSETS OF $60.9

BILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AS FOLLOWS: $84.7 BILLION OF LOANS; $7.4 BILLION OF

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; $4.4 BILLION OF OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $20.8 BILLION OF

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ASSETS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF RETAINED AFS SECURITIES THAT WERE ELIMINATED

UPON CONSOLIDATION. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $65.4 BILLION OF LIABILITIES REPRESENTING THE

TRUSTS BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED TO THIRD PARTIES.

FOR PAYMENT OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE

TO PAY THE FIRMS OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR THE CLAIMS OF THE FIRMS OTHER CREDITORS.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS (WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM 4% TO 12%). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM HELD UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS OF $17.2 BILLION. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES

OWNED BY THOSE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 19% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE FIRM ALSO

RETAINED $1.1 BILLION OF SENIOR SECURITIES AND $3.2 BILLION OF SUBORDINATED SECURITIES IN CERTAIN

OF ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN

THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS AND SECURITIES RETAINED ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ACCOUNTED FOR ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS AS QSPES AND

THEREFORE THESE ENTITIES WERE NOT CONSOLIDATED. THE FIRM RECORDED ONLY ITS RETAINED INTERESTS IN

THE ENTITIES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING OF TOTAL ASSETS HELD BY FIRM-SPONSORED

NONCONSOLIDATED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS QSPES WAS $109.6 BILLION IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD

CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM RETAINED UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OF $16.7 BILLION, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LOANS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES OWNED BY

THOSE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 16% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FIRM ALSO RETAINED $7.2

BILLION OF SENIOR SECURITIES AND $6.6 BILLION OF SUBORDINATED

SECURITIES IN CERTAIN OF ITS CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS AFS SECURITIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS INTERESTS INCLUDED $1.0 BILLION OF ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND $3.2 BILLION OF

RETAINED SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES ON SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES, WHICH WERE

CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS.

DURING 2009, THE FIRM TOOK CERTAIN ACTIONS PERMITTED BY THE TRUST AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF

THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS.



CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE TRUST): IN 2009, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED, FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL

PURPOSES, THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE FIRMS PRIMARY ISSUANCE TRUST) AS A RESULT OF TAKING

CERTAIN ACTIONS PERMITTED BY THE TRUST AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING INCREASING THE REQUIRED CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT LEVEL OF EACH TRANCHE OF OUTSTANDING NOTES ISSUED BY THE TRUST AND INCREASING THE

EXCESS SPREAD FOR THE TRUST. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY $40

BILLION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH DECREASED THE FIRMS

TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO BY APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS, AT THAT TIME, BUT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS .



WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER TRUST (WMMT): THE FIRM

ACQUIRED AN INTEREST IN THE WMMT AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKING OPERATIONS. IN 2009, THE

FIRM REMOVED ALL REMAINING CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, RESULTING

IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE WMMT FOR ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES. AS A

RESULT, THE FIRM RECORDED, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, ADDITIONAL ASSETS WITH AN

INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF $6.0 BILLION, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES WITH AN INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF $6.1

BILLION AND A PRETAX LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION.

FIRM-SPONSORED MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER

CONSUMER LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS) PRIMARILY IN ITS RFS AND IB BUSINESSES.

DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS INVOLVED, THE FIRM MAY

ACT AS THE SERVICER OF THE LOANS AND/OR RETAIN CERTAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS (BOTH

RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL) AND FIRM-SPONSORED AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOAN TRUSTS AS A RESULT OF

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE CONSOLIDATION DETERMINATION WAS BASED ON THE

FIRMS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH ITS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES AND

DUTIES, INCLUDING MAKING DECISIONS RELATED TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRMS CONTINUING ECONOMIC INVOLVEMENT WITH THESE TRUSTS OBLIGATES THE

FIRM TO ABSORB LOSSES AND GIVES THE FIRM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS FROM THE VIES THAT COULD

POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ACCOUNTED FOR ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE,

AUTOMOBILE, AND CERTAIN STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AS QSPES AND THEREFORE DID NOT CONSOLIDATE

THESE ENTITIES; ONLY THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN THESE ENTITIES WERE RECORDED ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN OTHER STUDENT

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE TOTAL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD IN JPMORGAN

CHASESPONSORED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, INCLUDING

THOSE THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM. CONTINUING

INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES SERVICING THE LOANS; HOLDING SENIOR INTERESTS OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS;

RECOURSE OR GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS; AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRMS ONLY CONTINUING

INVOLVEMENT IS SERVICING THE LOANS. IN THE TABLE BELOW, THE AMOUNT OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EQUAL THE ASSETS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED VIES

BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AT THEIR CURRENT OUTSTANDING PAR AMOUNTS; AND

BECAUSE A PORTION OF THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS (TRADING ASSETS AND AFS SECURITIES) ARE

REFLECTED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. SEE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY ON PAGES 255258 OF THIS NOTE FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS CASH FLOWS WITH AND INTERESTS RETAINED IN NONCONSOLIDATED

VIES.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

THE FIRM SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS, AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES BY EITHER RFS OR IB. RFS GENERALLY RETAINS SERVICING FOR ALL

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY RFS, AND FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED

BY IB.

FOR SECURITIZATIONS SERVICED BY RFS, THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF

THE VIE BECAUSE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATED TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. IN A

LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE SECURITIZATIONS, RFS ALSO RETAINS AN INTEREST IN THE VIE THAT COULD

POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. IN THESE INSTANCES, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION OF ASSETS AND $3.0 BILLION OF LIABILITIES OF

FIRM-SPONSORED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON BALANCE SHEET. FOR

FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS SERVICED BY UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE

THE VIE AS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES RESIDES WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICER. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, RFS DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY VIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES. RFS HELD RETAINED INTERESTS OF APPROXIMATELY $205 MILLION AND $537

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, IN NONCONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. SEE PAGES 257258 OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON RETAINED

INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED VIES; THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS

OR AFS SECURITIES.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE LOAN SALES ARE PRIMARILY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK

OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST.

HOWEVER, FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN SALES, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO SHARE A PORTION OF THE CREDIT

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLD LOANS WITH THE PURCHASER. SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 275280 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON

INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. SEE PAGE 257 OF THIS NOTE FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

IB ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING SECURITIES ISSUED BY FIRM-SPONSORED

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. AS A RESULT, IB AT TIMES RETAINS SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS

(INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS) IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS UPON SECURITIZATION, AND/OR

REACQUIRES POSITIONS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIONS RETAINED OR REACQUIRED BY IB, WHEN CONSIDERED TOGETHER WITH

THE SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY RFS, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

CERTAIN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $1.2 BILLION OF VIE ASSETS AND $702 MILLION OF

LIABILITIES WERE CONSOLIDATED DUE TO IBS INVOLVEMENT WITH SUCH TRUSTS. IB DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY

RESIDENTIAL SECURITIZATION VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES. IB HELD APPROXIMATELY

$461 MILLION, AND $479 MILLION OF SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED INTERESTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, IN NONCONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. THIS INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION AND $2 MILLION OF RESIDUAL

INTERESTS AT DECEMBER

31, 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. SEE PAGES 257258 OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS. THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS

IB ORIGINATES AND SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING

ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. IB MAY RETAIN UNSOLD SENIOR

AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION

BUT, GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT SERVICE COMMERCIAL LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATIONS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE GENERALLY IS HELD BY THE

SERVICER OR INVESTORS

IN A SPECIFIED CLASS OF SECURITIES (CONTROLLING CLASS). AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY $84

MILLION OF VIE ASSETS AND $82 MILLION OF VIE LIABILITIES OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS WERE CONSOLIDATED DUE TO THE FIRM HOLDING CERTAIN SUBORDINATED INTERESTS THAT GIVE THE FIRM

THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST. IB DID NOT

CONSOLIDATE ANY COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM HELD

$2.0 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RETAINED INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS. THIS INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY ZERO AND $22 MILLION OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM ALSO SECURITIZES AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS, AND CONSUMER LOANS

(INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS) PURCHASED BY IB. THE FIRM RETAINS SERVICING

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL ORIGINATED AND CERTAIN PURCHASED STUDENT AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND HAS THE

POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH THESE SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES. AT DECEMBER

31, 2010, $4.5 BILLION OF ASSETS AND $3.2 BILLION OF LIABILITIES OF STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

WERE CONSOLIDATED DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS HELD BY THE FIRM AND SERVICING

RESPONSIBILITIES. AUTO LOANS PREVIOUSLY SECURITIZED WERE REPURCHASED BY THE FIRM DURING 2010 AS

THESE SECURITIZATION ENTITIES WERE TERMINATED. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM HELD $9 MILLION

AND $49 MILLION OF RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT UNDER PRIOR

ACCOUNTING RULES. THESE RETAINED INTERESTS WERE REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, THE FIRM HELD INTERESTS IN OTHER STUDENT LOANS WHICH RESULTED IN $3.8 BILLION OF OTHER

STUDENT LOANS BEING CONSOLIDATED ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES.

RE-SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM ENGAGES IN RE-SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH SECURITIES ARE TRANSFERRED TO A VIE IN

EXCHANGE FOR NEW BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. RE-SECURITIZATIONS INVOLVE THE REPACKAGING OF SECURITIES

PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY BOTH AGENCY SPONSORED (FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND GINNIE MAE) AND NONAGENCY

(PRIVATE-LABEL) VIES THAT ARE GENERALLY BACKED BY EITHER RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. A

RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITY RECEIVES PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

248

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FROM THE SECURITIES HELD IN THE

ENTITY AND PASSES THEM TO THE BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS. THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT ACTIVELY MANAGED

AND ARE PASSIVE IN NATURE. RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED TO THE SPECIFICATIONS

OF THE INVESTORS. IN A RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITY, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POWER IS IN THE DESIGN OF THE

ENTITY (I.E., THE DECISION AS TO THE SPECIFIC SECURITY OR SECURITIES TO BE REPACKAGED AND THE TERMS

OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED). THE POWER OVER A RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITY IS OFTEN CONSIDERED

TO BE SHARED BETWEEN THE SPONSOR AND INVESTOR(S) THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREATION

AND DESIGN OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY

AGENCY RE-SECURITIZATIONS, AS IT DID NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT

ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED $477

MILLION OF ASSETS AND $230 MILLION OF LIABILITIES OF PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATIONS, AS THE FIRM

HAD BOTH THE UNILATERAL POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF, AND RETAINED A SIGNIFICANT

INTEREST IN, THESE RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE

ANY RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES (AGENCY OR PRIVATE-LABEL) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009, AND 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $33.9 BILLION, $19.1

BILLION AND $16.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO AGENCY RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES AND

$1.3 BILLION, $4.0 BILLION AND $2.7 BILLION TO PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM HELD APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION

AND $1.6 BILLION OF BOTH SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED AGENCY

RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES AND $46 MILLION AND $220 MILLION OF BOTH SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED

INTERESTS, IN NONCONSOLIDATED PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATION

ENTITIES. SEE PAGES 257258 OF THIS

NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATION VIES.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, AND IT HELPS CUSTOMERS

MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN

AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITIES

THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND

LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY

SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST

INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE

CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) TO THE CONDUITS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS

ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS,

AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE

ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS,

LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES.

THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH

THE CONDUITS.

TO ENSURE TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A

MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE

FORM OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THEY ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED SO THE LIQUIDITY THAT WILL BE

PROVIDED BY THE FIRM (AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER) WILL BE EFFECTED BY THE FIRM PURCHASING, OR LENDING

AGAINST, A POOL OF NONDEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE

UNCONDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO PERFORM UNDER ITS ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CONDUIT AT ANY TIME. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER,

WHICH IS GENERALLY THE FIRM, TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE CONDUIT AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS

THEN CURRENT FAIR VALUE  IN EFFECT, PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE ASSETS INITIAL VALUE.

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT VEHICLES WITH PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IN

THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED SHORT-TERM REVOLVING FACILITIES ESTABLISHED TO

HANDLE FUNDING INCREMENTS TOO SMALL TO BE FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS ONLY IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM

DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET.

BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES WILL ONLY FUND NONDEFAULTED ASSETS,

PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ABSORB LOSSES ON DEFAULTED RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF

LOSSES ABSORBED BY ANY DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT MAY BE

PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OR BY THIRD-PARTY SURETY BOND

PROVIDERS. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED VARIES BY CONDUIT AND RANGES

BETWEEN 5% AND 10% OF THE APPLICABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER THAT IS OUTSTANDING. THE FIRM PROVIDED $2.0

BILLION AND $2.4 BILLION OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES FEES FOR STRUCTURING MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND COMPENSATION

FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND

PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS

THE FIRM HAS BOTH THE

POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONDUITS AND A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

INTEREST IN THE CONDUITS. THE FIRM DIRECTS THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE CONDUITS AS

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND IN ITS ROLE IN STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS FOR THE CONDUITS. IN THESE ROLES,

THE FIRM MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING CONCENTRATION OF ASSET TYPES AND CREDIT QUALITY OF TRANSACTIONS,

AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING NEEDS OF THE CONDUITS. THE FIRMS

INTERESTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIES INCLUDE THE FEES RECEIVED AS

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER AND PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, AS WELL

AS THE FIRMS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE AS A RESULT OF THE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES

PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM HAD CONSOLIDATED ONE OF ITS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS; ALL OTHER

FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WERE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRIOR ACCOUNTING

RULES. UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING RULES, THE PARTY THAT ABSORBED THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITYS EXPECTED

LOSSES, RECEIVED A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITYS RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR

BOTH, WOULD CONSOLIDATE. EACH

NONCONSOLIDATED MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ADMINISTERED BY THE FIRM AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 HAD ISSUED

EXPECTED LOSS NOTES (ELNS), THE HOLDERS OF WHICH WERE COMMITTED TO ABSORBING THE MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED LOSS OF EACH RESPECTIVE CONDUIT. THE TOTAL AMOUNTS OF ELNS OUTSTANDING FOR NONCONSOLIDATED

CONDUITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS $96 MILLION.

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS ON NONCONSOLIDATED FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

WAS $24.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS, CALCULATED SEPARATELY FOR

EACH MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT, INCLUDED THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO BOTH DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES

AND PROGRAM WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS. FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS, FIRM-PROVIDED PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT

PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES.

VIES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVES, WITH THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES AND ASSET SWAP VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM HAS CREATED A SERIES OF TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH QUALIFYING

TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE THEIR

INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES

FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF

SECURITIES: (1) PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

(RESIDUAL INTERESTS). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING

MUNICIPAL BONDS IS LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY PUT, OR TENDER,

THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. IF FUNDED, THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITY WOULD BE REPAID BY THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS UPON

TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE. IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY, THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE TO THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

THE HOLDERS OF THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN THESE VEHICLES COULD EXPERIENCE LOSSES IF THE FACE AMOUNT

OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES EXCEEDS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS UPON

TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE. CERTAIN VEHICLES REQUIRE A SMALLER INITIAL INVESTMENT BY THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST HOLDERS AND THUS DO NOT RESULT IN EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION. FOR THESE VEHICLES THERE

EXISTS A REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION WHICH REQUIRES THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS TO POST, DURING THE

LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO THE FIRM, AS LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER, ON A DAILY BASIS SHOULD

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINE.

JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK, N.A. OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES

LLC AS REMARKETING AGENT, OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS

OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE

BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT

OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW

INVESTMENT GRADE. A DOWNGRADE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S SHORT-TERM RATING DOES NOT AFFECT THE

FIRMS OBLIGATION UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS

CREDIT RATINGS, HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES SUPPORTED BY THOSE LIQUIDITY

FACILITY COMMITMENTS MIGHT CHOOSE TO SELL THEIR INSTRUMENTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD

THAT THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS COULD BE DRAWN. IN VEHICLES IN WHICH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS, IN ADDITION TO THE TERMINATION EVENTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE AS LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER IS FURTHER LIMITED BY

250

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE

EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS

WITH THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, THE FIRM HELD $248 MILLION AND $72 MILLION

OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM AT

ANY TIME DURING 2010 WAS $796 MILLION, OR 6%, OF THE MUNICIPAL

BOND VEHICLES AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT

ANY RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND HOLDINGS.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND TO THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND. A DOWNGRADE OF A BOND INSURER WOULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE RATING OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES. THIS COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR,

AS PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS TYPICALLY REQUIRE AN AA- BOND RATING. AT DECEMBER

31, 2010 AND 2009, 96% AND 98%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS

HELD BY VEHICLES FOR WHICH THE

FIRM SERVED AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WERE RATED AA- OR BETTER, BASED ON EITHER THE RATING OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND ITSELF OR THE BOND RATING INCLUDING ANY CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. AT DECEMBER

31, 2010 AND 2009, $3.4 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE BONDS WERE INSURED BY

MONOLINE BOND INSURERS.

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTEREST. THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST GENERALLY ALLOWS THE OWNER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE, PRIMARILY BY DIRECTING THE SALE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS

OWNED BY THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION, THE RESIDUAL INTEREST OWNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS

AND BEAR LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE. THE FIRM DOES

NOT CONSOLIDATE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT DOES NOT OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, SINCE THE FIRM

DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES

HIGHLY RATED ASSETS, SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT

WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT HOLD. THE

VIE THEN ISSUES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES (CLNS) WITH MATURITIES PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO 10

YEARS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE VIES INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND

INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER USING A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A

HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN SUCH NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRMS

EXPOSURE TO THE CLN VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE VIE, AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL

SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS NOT HISTORICALLY PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO

THE CLN VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES

NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLN VEHICLES. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE,

THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS

BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES IS LARGELY INVESTMENT-GRADE,

WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT BEING RATED AAA. THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES

BROADLY INTO TWO TYPES: STATIC AND MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT

EITHER REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATION), OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED

PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. THE FIRM GENERALLY BUYS PROTECTION FROM THE VIE UNDER THE

CREDIT DERIVATIVE.

IN A MANAGED CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE GENERALLY

REFERENCE ALL OR PART OF AN ACTIVELY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. AN AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN A

PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND THE VIE THAT GIVES THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE EACH

REFERENCED CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CREDIT. BY PARTICIPATING IN A STRUCTURE WHERE

A PORTFOLIO MANAGER HAS THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE CREDITS WITHIN PRE-AGREED TERMS, THE INVESTORS

WHO OWN THE CLNS SEEK TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT ANY SINGLE CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL DEFAULT. THE

FIRM DOES NOT ACT AS PORTFOLIO MANAGER; ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO BEING

A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, IN BOTH STATIC AND MANAGED

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A

PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE OF THE CREDITS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO

DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF REFERENCE CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS.

SINCE EACH CLN IS ESTABLISHED TO THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE INVESTORS, THE INVESTORS HAVE THE POWER

OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THAT VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLN.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE ENTITIES.

FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. AS A

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH

DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH

VIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE.

ARE STRUCTURED AT INCEPTION SO THAT THE PAR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

SUFFICIENT TO PAY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES AND EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET SWAP VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. IN

SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THE VIE PURCHASES A SPECIFIC ASSET OR ASSETS AND THEN ENTERS INTO A DERIVATIVE

WITH THE FIRM IN ORDER TO TAILOR THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY RISK, OR BOTH,

ACCORDING TO INVESTORS REQUIREMENTS. GENERALLY, THE ASSETS ARE

HELD BY THE VIE TO MATURITY, AND

THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVES WOULD MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE ASSETS. INVESTORS TYPICALLY INVEST IN

THE NOTES ISSUED BY SUCH VIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE SPECIFIC

ASSETS, AS WELL AS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR

SPECIFIC NEEDS. THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE VIE MAY INCLUDE CURRENCY SWAPS

252

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TO HEDGE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY INTO THE INVESTORS LOCAL CURRENCY

OR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE; TO ADD ADDITIONAL

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE INTO THE VIE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RETURN

ON THE ISSUED NOTES; OR TO

CONVERT AN INTEREST-BEARING ASSET INTO A ZERO-COUPON BOND.

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ASSET SWAP VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE INTEREST RATE AND/OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM HISTORICALLY HAS NOT

PROVIDED

ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES, SINCE THE FIRM DOES

NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT HAVE A

VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS

A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

INVESTMENT IN A THIRD-PARTY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST

THE FIRM HOLDS TWO INTERESTS IN A THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED VIE, WHICH IS A CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

TRUST THAT OWNS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ISSUED BY A NATIONAL RETAILER. THE FIRM IS NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE TRUST, AS THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE

THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THE FIRST NOTE IS STRUCTURED SO THAT

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT CAN FLOAT UP TO 47% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE RECEIVABLES HELD BY THE

TRUST, NOT TO EXCEED $4.2 BILLION. THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE WITHIN AFS

SECURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE NOTE WAS $3.0 BILLION AND $3.5

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS $3.1 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM

ACCOUNTS FOR ITS OTHER INTEREST WITH THE TRUST, WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS NOTED ABOVE, AS

A LOAN AT AMORTIZED COST. THIS SENIOR LOAN HAD AN AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.0 BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON AFS SECURITIES AND LOANS,

SEE NOTES 12 AND 14 ON PAGES 214218 AND 220238, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

VIE USED IN FRBNY TRANSACTION

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, IN JUNE 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

(FRBNY) TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH AN LLC FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF A PORTFOLIO OF $30.0 BILLION IN

ASSETS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE LLC WERE FUNDED

BY A $28.85 BILLION TERM LOAN FROM THE FRBNY AND A $1.15 BILLION SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN IS SUBORDINATED TO THE

FRBNY LOAN AND WILL BEAR THE FIRST $1.15

BILLION OF ANY LOSSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF

THE FRBNY LOAN, REPAYMENT OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LLC WILL BE FOR THE

ACCOUNT OF THE FRBNY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FRBNY AND JPMORGAN CHASE LOANS WILL BE REPAID WILL

DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND THE LIQUIDATION STRATEGY DIRECTED BY THE

FRBNY. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE LLC, AS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. PRIOR TO

JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE LLC IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

UNDER PRIOR CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE SINCE IT DID NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE

MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR

BOTH.

OTHER VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE INCLUDE, FOR

EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT

AGENT, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT

DECISIONS ARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF

THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE

THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OR A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD

POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT, THE FIRM RECORDS AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS SIMILARLY TO THE WAY IT WOULD RECORD AND REPORT

POSITIONS IN RESPECT OF ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY

TRANSACTION.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE TRUST, THE FIRM

RECORDS THE TRANSFER OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE TO THE TRUST AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR

A SALE ARE MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM

THE FIRMS CREDITORS; (2) THE TRANSFEREE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDER CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE

TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE

TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., THE FIRM CANNOT REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR

MATURITY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS).

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES A GAIN OR LOSS BASED ON THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED (INCLUDING CASH, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, OR

SERVICING ASSETS RECEIVED) AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS SOLD. GAINS AND LOSSES ON

SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. THE VALUE OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED IS

DETERMINED UNDER THE FIRMS VALUATION POLICIES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 170187 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETAINED INTERESTS IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FORM AND

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RETAINED INTEREST. INTERESTS RETAINED BY IB ARE CLASSIFIED AS

TRADING ASSETS. INTERESTS RETAINED IN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INCLUDING RFS AND CORPORATE

TREASURY, MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS AFS SECURITIES OR TRADING ASSETS. SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 214218 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON AFS SECURITIES.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON

A 10% OR 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED EASILY, BECAUSE THE

RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO,

IN THE TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT COUNTERACT OR MAGNIFY THE SENSITIVITIES. THE ABOVE SENSITIVITIES

ALSO DO NOT REFLECT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THE FIRM MAY UNDERTAKE TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS.

(A)

REFLECTS GROSS GOODWILL BALANCES AS THE FIRM HAS NOT RECOGNIZED ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES TO

DATE.

(B)

INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHER TAX-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL DURING 2010 WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE RBS SEMPRA COMMODITIES

BUSINESS IN IB, AND THE PURCHASE OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN GÁVEA INVESTIMENTOS, A LEADING

ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN BRAZIL, BY AM. THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL DURING 2009 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO FINAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND THE

ACQUISITION OF A COMMODITIES BUSINESS (EACH PRIMARILY ALLOCATED TO IB), AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE FIRMS CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACCOUNTING

ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEAR STEARNS AND BANK ONE MERGERS. THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL DURING

2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE

(ALLOCATED TO CARD SERVICES), THE MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS, THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL EQUITY

INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE AND TAX-RELATED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANK ONE

MERGER (WHICH WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO IB).

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 OR 2009, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DUE TO

IMPAIRMENT DURING 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE

OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE

IS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL IS

CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING

GOODWILL), THEN A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT (AS

DETERMINED IN STEP ONE) TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AS IF THE

REPORTING UNIT WERE BEING ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE RESULTING IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR

VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IS LESS THAN ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR

VALUE, THEN NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

THE PRIMARY METHOD THE FIRM USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS THE INCOME

APPROACH.

THE MODELS PROJECT CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND USE THE PERPETUITY GROWTH

METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUES. THESE CASH FLOWS AND TERMINAL VALUES ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING

AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. PROJECTIONS OF CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS EARNINGS

FORECASTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES (INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CARD ACT, AND LIMITATIONS ON NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES).

THESE FORECASTS ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM. THE FIRMS COST OF

EQUITY IS DETERMINED USING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH METHODOLOGIES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THE FIRM USES WHEN ADVISING CLIENTS IN THIRD PARTY TRANSACTIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE

USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL FOR THAT

REPORTING UNIT AND IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FIRMS OVERALL COST OF EQUITY, AS ADJUSTED FOR THE

RISK CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO EACH REPORTING UNIT (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK OR

UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS OR MANAGEMENTS FORECASTS AND ASSUMPTIONS). TO ASSESS THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, MANAGEMENT COMPARES THE DISCOUNT

RATE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND

RISK CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF EQUITY (AGGREGATING THE VARIOUS

REPORTING UNITS) IS COMPARED WITH THE FIRMS OVERALL COST OF EQUITY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS.

THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH MARKET-BASED

TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES FOR RELEVANT COMPETITORS. PRECISE CONCLUSIONS GENERALLY CAN NOT

BE DRAWN FROM THESE COMPARISONS DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES THAT NATURALLY EXIST BETWEEN THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND COMPETITOR INSTI-

260

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TUTIONS. HOWEVER, TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED AS

GENERAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE GENERAL REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. MANAGEMENT

ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS REPORTING

UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASES MARKET CAPITALIZATION. IN EVALUATING THIS COMPARISON, MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING (A) A CONTROL PREMIUM THAT WOULD EXIST IN A MARKET

TRANSACTION, (B) FACTORS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION RISK THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE FIRM-WIDE

LEVEL THAT DO NOT EXIST AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AND (C) SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS.

WHILE NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS RECOGNIZED DURING 2010, THE FIRMS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES

IN RFS AND CS REMAIN AT ELEVATED RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THEIR EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER

CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE VALUATION OF THESE

BUSINESSES IS PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT UPON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS

AND HOME PRICES), AND REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT CONSUMER CREDIT CARD USE.

THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WERE

DETERMINED USING MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES. THE COST OF EQUITY REFLECTED THE RELATED RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY, AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON TO RELEVANT MARKET PEERS. DETERIORATION IN THESE

ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED

GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE

PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SPECIFIED

MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES (PREDOMINANTLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE) FOR OTHERS. MSRS

ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS;

MAKING TAX AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE

INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE MADE THE DETERMINATION TO TREAT ITS MSRS AS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS BASED ON

THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS USED TO MEASURE ITS MSR ASSET AT FAIR VALUE AND ITS TREATMENT OF

MSRS AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM

ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL (OAS), WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS

OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

FIRMS PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN

DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,

CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES,

OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND

PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET

CONDITIONS

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET.

DURING 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL BASED ON A

NUMBER OF MARKET-RELATED FACTORS, INCLUDING A DOWNWARD TREND IN HOME PRICES, GENERAL TIGHTENING OF

CREDIT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON REFINANCING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM COMPARES

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, AND TO RECENT

MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES TO MANAGE CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. MSRS DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN

INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY

CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE

IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED,

BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE

LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE

FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR

MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE UPON COMPLETION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION

OR CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS, AND GENERALLY REPRESENT THE VALUE OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR

ARRANGEMENTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRMS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES, INCLUDING CORE DEPOSIT

INTANGIBLES, PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER

THEIR USEFUL LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2010 WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO AMORTIZATION,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE RESULTING FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED GÁVEA INVESTIMENTOS TRANSACTION.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

THE FIRMS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED, AND, FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES, ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET COMPARES THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE SUM OF

THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED. IF

THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS RECOGNIZED TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THEN AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

NOTE 18  PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. JPMORGAN CHASE COMPUTES DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET. FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THE FIRM USES THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD COMPUTED OVER THE LESSER OF THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASED FACILITY OR THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE LEASED ASSET.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED IMMATERIAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ASBESTOS REMEDIATION IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO

ESTIMATE THE OBLIGATIONS FAIR VALUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED

ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SOFTWARES EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN

ONGOING BASIS.

ON

NOVEMBER 21, 2008, THE FDIC RELEASED FINAL RULES ON THE FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE

PROGRAM (THE TLG PROGRAM). ONE COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM, THE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE

PROGRAM (THE TAG PROGRAM), PROVIDED UNLIMITED DEPOSIT INSURANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009, ON

CERTAIN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AT FDIC-INSURED PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS. THE

FIRM ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TLG PROGRAM AND, AS A RESULT, WAS REQUIRED TO PAY ADDITIONAL

INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO THE FDIC IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AN ANNUALIZED 10 BASIS POINTS ON BALANCES IN

NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS THAT EXCEEDED THE $250,000

FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE LIMITS. THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED TO DECEMBER 31, 2010, TO PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THOSE

INSTITUTIONS MOST AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND TO ENABLE THE

PROGRAM TO BE PHASED-OUT IN AN ORDERLY

MANNER. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM NO LONGER PARTICIPATED IN THE TAG PROGRAM. AS A RESULT,

FUNDS HELD IN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE

NO LONGER

GUARANTEED IN FULL. INSTEAD, THEY ARE INSURED UP TO $250,000 UNDER THE FDICS GENERAL DEPOSIT

AS NOTED IN NOTE 23 ON PAGES 267268, PURSUANT TO THE U.S. TREASURYS CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM,

THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES OF THE FIRMS

COMMON STOCK, AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTIDILUTION AND OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS. THE U.S. TREASURY EXCHANGED THE WARRANT FOR 88,401,697 WARRANTS, EACH OF WHICH WAS A

WARRANT TO PURCHASE A SHARE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE

AND, ON DECEMBER 11, 2009, SOLD THE WARRANTS IN A SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERING FOR $950 MILLION. THE

WARRANTS ARE EXERCISABLE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL OCTOBER 28,

2018. THE FIRM DID NOT PURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS SOLD BY THE U.S. TREASURY.

UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE FIRM IS

AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK PLUS 88 MILLION WARRANTS

SOLD BY THE U.S. TREASURY IN 2009. DURING 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS

COMMON STOCK OR WARRANTS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM RESUMED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES,

AND DURING THE YEAR REPURCHASED AN AGGREGATE OF 78 MILLION SHARES FOR $3.0 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE

PRICE PER SHARE OF $38.49. THE FIRMS SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES IN 2010 WERE INTENDED TO OFFSET

SHARECOUNT INCREASES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS AND WERE CONSISTENT WITH

THE FIRMS GOAL OF MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE SHARECOUNT. THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF THE

WARRANTS DURING 2010. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, $3.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY

REMAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMON STOCK, AND ALL OF THE AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED

WITH RESPECT TO THE WARRANTS.

THE FIRM MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE

ITS EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE

DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE

ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 564 MILLION UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE, COMPENSATION, OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS,

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PLANS, AND THE WARRANTS SOLD BY THE U.S. TREASURY AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

NOTE 25  EARNINGS PER SHARE

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPATING

SECURITIES, WHICH CLARIFIES THAT UNVESTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS CONTAINING NONFORFEITABLE

RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS (COLLECTIVELY, DIVIDENDS) ARE PARTICIPATING

SECURITIES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) CALCULATION USING THE TWO-CLASS

METHOD. UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD, ALL EARNINGS (DISTRIBUTED AND UNDISTRIBUTED) ARE ALLOCATED TO

EACH CLASS OF COMMON STOCK AND PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO

RECEIVE DIVIDENDS.

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ENTITLE THE RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE NONFORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS

DURING THE VESTING PERIOD ON A BASIS EQUIVALENT TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK;

THESE UNVESTED AWARDS MEET THE DEFINITION OF PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. EPS DATA FOR THE PRIOR

PERIODS WERE REVISED AS REQUIRED BY THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

OPTIONS ISSUED UNDER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

PLANS THAT HAVE AN ANTIDILUTIVE EFFECT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EPS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 27  INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS

RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT

THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR

EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN

EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES EXPENSE FOR

INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE

MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY REPORTED.

THE COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE/(BENEFIT) INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

WERE AS FOLLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES $485 MILLION, $280 MILLION AND $55 MILLION OF TAX BENEFITS

RECORDED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF TAX AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD

DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TAX EFFECT OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF $1.8

BILLION IN 2010, A DECREASE OF $3.7 BILLION IN 2009, AND AN

INCREASE OF $3.0 BILLION IN 2008.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD

OF TIME.

DURING 2008, AS PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND

STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, FOR WHICH U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAD BEEN PROVIDED,

WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND THE CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES.

AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

ITS U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THIS DETERMINATION RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF AN

INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IN 2008. FOR 2010,

PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION WERE GENERATED THAT WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS

IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $19.3 BILLION. IF THE FIRM WERE TO RECORD A DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT WOULD BE $4.3 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010.

TAX EXPENSE APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $1.1

BILLION, $427 MILLION, AND $608 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY U.S. INCOME TAX RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $1.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IN CONNECTION

WITH U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARD WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION; THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION; THE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WAS $515

MILLION; AND THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD WAS APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION.

IF NOT UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD AND THE STATE AND LOCAL NET

OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL EXPIRE IN 2027; AND THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD WILL

EXPIRE IN 2020. THE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARY NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD HAS AN UNLIMITED

CARRYFORWARD PERIOD.

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND

CERTAIN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS, AND CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL TAX BENEFITS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, JPMORGAN CHASES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES, WERE $7.8 BILLION, $6.6 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

WHICH $3.8 BILLION, $3.5 BILLION AND $2.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE THE

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS JPMORGAN CHASE IS PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAX

AUTHORITIES, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE GROSS BALANCE OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EXPECT THAT

ANY CHANGES OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IN ITS GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAUSED BY

SUCH AUDITS WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ITS ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

NOTE 28  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND

INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.) IS SUBJECT

TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE BANK IS

A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, AND ITS DEPOSITS IN THE U.S. ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE

BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS

APPROXIMATELY $803 MILLION AND $821 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED

LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS

TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH

LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS

AND INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY

ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE

BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE

AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE

IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2011, JPMORGAN CHASES BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$2.0 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY

DIVIDENDS IN 2011 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $25.0 BILLION AND $24.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $9.7 BILLION AND $10.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED

IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 29  CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA,

N.A.

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL

CONSISTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1, SUBORDINATED

LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL CAPITAL IS TIER 1 CAPITAL PLUS

TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS

MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED QUARTERLY AVERAGE

ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION.

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY

REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

(B)

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS CONSIST OF ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE

OF SEVERAL BROAD RISK CATEGORIES AND WEIGHTED BY FACTORS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK AND POTENTIAL

FOR DEFAULT. ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE PERCEIVED CREDIT RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY, THE NATURE OF ANY COLLATERAL, AND THE GUARANTOR,

IF ANY. OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS SUCH AS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, DERIVATIVES

AND OTHER APPLICABLE OFFBALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BY MULTIPLYING THE

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT BY THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT CONVERSION FACTOR TO DETERMINE THE ONBALANCE

SHEET CREDIT-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT, WHICH IS THEN RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE SAME FACTORS USED FOR

ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ALSO INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR THE MARKET RISK

RELATED TO APPLICABLE TRADING ASSETSDEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. THE RESULTING RISK-WEIGHTED VALUES FOR EACH OF THE RISK CATEGORIES ARE

THEN AGGREGATED TO DETERMINE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

(C)

INCLUDES OFFBALANCE SHEET RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OF $282.9 BILLION,

$274.2 BILLION AND $31 MILLION, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OF $367.4 BILLION, $312.3 BILLION

NOTE

30  OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER

COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE FIRMS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON

THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION

UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE

COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS

ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) RELATED

CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED.

SEE NOTE 15

ON PAGES

239243 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME

TIME. THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL CREDIT CARD LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER PRIOR

NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE FIRM MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HOME

EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY

OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER.

NOTE 3 AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 170187 AND 187189 RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GUARANTEES

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN

AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. U.S. GAAP

DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR TO PAY A GUARANTEED

PARTY BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF THE

GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM

CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER U.S.

GAAP: CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES,

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM INITIALLY RECORDS GUARANTEES AT THE INCEPTION DATE FAIR VALUE OF

THE OBLIGATION ASSUMED (E.G., THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION RECEIVED, THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE

PREMIUM RECEIVABLE). FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GUARANTEES, THE FIRM RECORDS THIS FAIR VALUE AMOUNT IN

OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN CASH (FOR

PREMIUMS RECEIVED), OR OTHER

ASSETS (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE). ANY PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IS REDUCED AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY

RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF

THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. FOR INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED IN SALES AGREEMENTS, A PORTION OF THE SALE

PROCEEDS IS ALLOCATED TO THE GUARANTEE, WHICH ADJUSTS THE GAIN OR LOSS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT

FROM THE TRANSACTION. FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, THE INITIAL LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED TO INCOME AS

THE FIRMS RISK IS REDUCED (I.E., OVER TIME OR WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES). ANY CONTINGENT

LIABILITY THAT EXISTS AS A RESULT OF ISSUING THE GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION IS RECOGNIZED WHEN IT

BECOME PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE CONTINGENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT RECOGNIZED

IF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION

(ADJUSTED FOR ANY AMORTIZATION).

THE RECORDED AMOUNTS OF THE LIABILITIES RELATED TO GUARANTEES AND

INDEMNIFICATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, ARE DISCUSSED IN FOOTNOTE (B) TO THE TABLE ABOVE AND BELOW IN THIS

NOTE ON PAGES 276280.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT (SBLC) AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING

COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY THE FIRM TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER

CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS,

TRADE AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. THE CARRYING VALUES OF STANDBY AND OTHER LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE

$707 MILLION AND $920 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED IN

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS; THESE CARRYING VALUES

INCLUDE $347 MILLION AND $553 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS, AND $360 MILLION AND $367 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE GUARANTEE LIABILITY AND

CORRESPONDING ASSET.

INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS  GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A

CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY

INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE

IN LIEU OF MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO

INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (SOFTWARE

LICENSEES) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS),

PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY

OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY

INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD

REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE

FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE

RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

THROUGH THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND

NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM

PROVIDES AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING AGREEMENTS WHICH PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE

OF THE THIRD-PARTY BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES IN THE EVENT THE FIRM DID NOT OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL. TO MINIMIZE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM

OBTAINS CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF

THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT

COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL

EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL MAY BE RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A

BORROWER DEFAULTS, THE FIRM WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE

MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF. ALSO, AS PART OF THIS

PROGRAM, THE

FIRM INVESTS CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED

GUIDELINES.

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE CONTRACTS

INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON EXERCISE BY THE OPTION

HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT

OPTION CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT

OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTS SUCH AS

STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT

MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE

DERIVATIVES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS STABLE VALUE WRAPS, ARE TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW

INVESTORS TO REALIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO AND ARE

TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM OR MAY HAVE NO STATED MATURITY, BUT ALLOW THE FIRM TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING

ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES.

THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO

BE GUARANTEES WAS $87.8 BILLION AND $98.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS

GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT; THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT ON THESE STABLE VALUE

CONTRACTS WAS $25.9 BILLION AND $24.9 BILLION AND THE

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS WAS $2.7 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS REFLECTS THE

PROBABILITY OF WHETHER THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FAIR VALUE

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WERE DERIVATIVE PAYABLES OF $390 MILLION AND $974 MILLION AND

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF $96 MILLION AND $78 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPEC-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TIVELY. THE FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS, OR BY

ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES.

IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE, THE FIRM IS BOTH

A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES 191199 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UNSETTLED REVERSE REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES

BORROWING AGREEMENTS THAT SETTLE AT A FUTURE DATE. AT SETTLEMENT, THESE COMMITMENTS REQUIRE THAT

THE FIRM ADVANCE CASH TO AND ACCEPT SECURITIES FROM THE COUNTERPARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY DO

NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE, AND THEREFORE, ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL SETTLEMENT DATE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS

RELATED TO FORWARD STARTING REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS WERE

$14.4 BILLION AND $23.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. COMMITMENTS RELATED TO UNSETTLED REVERSE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS WITH REGULAR WAY SETTLEMENT PERIODS WERE $25.5

BILLION AND $24.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

BUILDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE FIRM SUCCEEDED TO AN OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENT

FOR THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 383 MADISON AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY (THE SYNTHETIC LEASE). UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE SYNTHETIC LEASE, THE FIRM WAS OBLIGATED TO A MAXIMUM RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE OF

APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION IF THE BUILDING WERE SOLD AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE WERE INSUFFICIENT

TO SATISFY THE LESSORS DEBT OBLIGATION. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2010, THE LEASE EXPIRED AND THE FIRM

PURCHASED THE PROPERTY RECOGNIZING THE $670 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE IN PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2010, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE THE LEASEHOLD PROPERTY AT 60

VICTORIA EMBANKMENT IN LONDON, A BUILDING THE FIRM HAS LEASED SINCE 1991, FOR APPROXIMATELY $253

MILLION. THE PURCHASE OF THIS BUILDING IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011.

LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

INDEMNIFICATIONS FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH THE GSES AND OTHER LOAN

SALE AND PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTES 14 AND 16 ON PAGES

220238 AND 244259, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM HAS MADE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. FOR TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES, THESE

REPRESENTATIONS INCLUDE TYPE OF COLLATERAL, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, VALIDITY OF CERTAIN BORROWER

REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN, THAT PRIMARY MORTGAGE INSURANCE IS IN FORCE FOR ANY

MORTGAGE LOAN WITH AN LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 80%, AND THE USE OF THE GSES STANDARD LEGAL

DOCUMENTATION. THE FIRM MAY BE, AND HAS BEEN,

REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE

GSES AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES; HOWEVER, PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM AND THE

FIRMS LOSSES REALIZED TO DATE ARE RELATED TO LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SUCH LOANS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE

DEFECTS SOLD TO PURCHASERS (INCLUDING SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES) PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRMS ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM

THE FDIC IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED AND/OR LIMITED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE

DEMANDS FOR LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE FIRMS POSITION

THAT SUCH OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP. NEVERTHELESS, CERTAIN PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN

MADE WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF THE THEN CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS, AND THE FIRM WILL

CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND MAY PAY CERTAIN FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL LOANS. IN

ADDITION TO THE PAYMENTS ALREADY MADE, THE FIRM HAS A REMAINING REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, RELATING TO UNRESOLVED AND FUTURE DEMANDS ON

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES RELATE TO ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY: (I) CREDIT QUALITY AND/OR UNDISCLOSED DEBT OF THE BORROWER; (II) INCOME LEVEL

AND/OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THE BORROWER; AND (III) APPRAISED VALUE OF COLLATERAL. INELIGIBILITY OF

THE BORROWER FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT, MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS AND MISSING DOCUMENTATION

ARE OTHER REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS.

BEGINNING IN 2009, MORTGAGE INSURERS MORE FREQUENTLY RESCINDED MORTGAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE

SUCCESSFUL RESCISSION OF MORTGAGE INSURANCE TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A VIOLATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES MADE TO THE GSES AND, THEREFORE, HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM

THE GSES. THE FIRM ACTIVELY REVIEWS ALL RESCISSION NOTICES FROM MORTGAGE INSURERS AND CONTESTS THEM

WHEN APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH VARIOUS MORTGAGE INSURERS ON

THEIR RIGHTS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO RESCINDING MORTGAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE FIRM HAS ENTERED

INTO AGREEMENTS WITH TWO MORTGAGE INSURERS TO MAKE PROCESSES MORE EFFICIENT AND REDUCE EXPOSURE ON

CLAIMS ON CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS A SERVICER. THE IMPACT OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS

REFLECTED IN THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

WHEN THE

FIRM ACCEPTS A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM ONE OF THE GSES, THE FIRM MAY EITHER (A) REPURCHASE

THE LOAN OR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL FROM THE GSE AT THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN PLUS

ACCRUED INTEREST, OR (B) REIMBURSE THE GSE FOR ITS REALIZED LOSS ON A LIQUIDATED PROPERTY (A

MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT).

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS REPURCHASE LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS.

(I)

THE LEVEL OF CURRENT UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES,

278

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(II)

ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS BASED UPON LOANS THAT ARE OR EVER HAVE BEEN 90

DAYS PAST DUE CONSIDERING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

(III)

THE POTENTIAL ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS,

(IV)

THE ESTIMATED SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OF THE LOAN OR COLLATERAL, MAKE-WHOLE SETTLEMENT, OR

INDEMNIFICATION,

(V)

THE FIRMS POTENTIAL ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS LOSSES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, AND

(VI)

THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURERS AND OTHER PARTIES.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED A REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF $3.3 BILLION AND $1.7

BILLION, INCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL LIABILITY DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES NET OF PROBABLE

RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY

FOR COMPUTING ITS RECORDED REPURCHASE LIABILITY  INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE

FUTURE DEMANDS FROM PURCHASERS, THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE IDENTIFIED DEFECTS, THE SEVERITY OF

LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE, AND RECOVERIES FROM THIRD

PARTIES  REQUIRE APPLICATION OF A

SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. ESTIMATING THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS FURTHER

COMPLICATED BY LIMITED AND RAPIDLY CHANGING HISTORICAL DATA AND UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING NUMEROUS

EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING: (I) MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND (II) THE LEVEL OF FUTURE DEMANDS,

WHICH IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS THE GSES AND MORTGAGE

INSURERS. WHILE THE FIRM USES THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT IN ESTIMATING ITS REPURCHASE

LIABILITY, THE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND IMPRECISE AND, ACCORDINGLY, LOSSES IN

EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF RESERVES

ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS FROM $0 TO APPROXIMATELY

$2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2010. THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS IS BASED ON AN ASSUMED PEAK TO TROUGH

DECLINE IN HOME PRICES OF 46%, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL 12 PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE IN HOME PRICES BEYOND THE FIRMS

CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS. SUCH A DECLINE COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF LOAN DELINQUENCIES, THEREBY

POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE REPURCHASE DEMAND RATE FROM THE GSES AND INCREASING LOSS SEVERITY ON

REPURCHASED LOANS, EACH OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REPURCHASE LIABILITY. THE FIRM DOES NOT

CONSIDER SUCH A FURTHER DECLINE IN HOME PRICES TO BE LIKELY TO OCCUR, AND ACTUAL REPURCHASE LOSSES

COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FIRMS RECORDED REPURCHASE LIABILITY OR THIS ESTIMATE OF

REASONABLY POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL LOSSES, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE

CONSIDERED ABOVE.

CHARGE TO THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A

RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS

THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE

SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS

FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON RECOURSE SERVICING

PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE

LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE LOAN AND THE

COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE FIRMS SECURITIZATIONS ARE

PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE

PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE

UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE TOTALED $11.0 BILLION AND $13.5 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM HAS RECORDED, WHICH IS

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD IT WILL HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER THIS GUARANTEE,

WAS $153 MILLION AND $271 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1, 2008, THE FIRM WAS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT VENTURE OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC

(THE JOINT VENTURE). THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDED

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE WAS

COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2008, AND JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE BUSINESS UNDER

THE CHASE PAYMENTECH NAME.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS

LIABLE PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT

OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS

FAVOR, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBERS ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO

THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF CHASE PAYMENTECH IS UNABLE

TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT

CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. CHASE PAYMENTECH MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE

SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE

UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES

OR A REFUND; (2) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND (3) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $12 MILLION

ON $469.3 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, IT HELD $189 MILLION OF

COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES

OF $11 MILLION ON $409.7 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, IT HELD

$213 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED

AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $13 MILLION ON $713.9 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, IT HELD $222 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY CHASE PAYMENTECH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS CHARGE

BACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAYMENT OR

PERFORMANCE RISK TO THE FIRM,

IS IMMATERIAL.

EXCHANGE AND CLEARINGHOUSE GUARANTEES

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND

CLEARINGHOUSES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS

REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF

THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE

OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A

MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTEE FUND, OR, IN A FEW

CASES, THE OBLIGATION MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE

UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY

BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

NOTE 31  COMMITMENTS, PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL AND CONTINGENCIES

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WERE OBLIGATED UNDER A NUMBER OF

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT USED PRIMARILY FOR BANKING PURPOSES, AND

FOR ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING SERVICE AGREEMENTS. CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS OR ESCALATION

CLAUSES PROVIDING FOR INCREASED RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON MAINTENANCE, UTILITY AND TAX INCREASES, OR

THEY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PERFORM RESTORATION WORK ON LEASED PREMISES. NO LEASE AGREEMENT IMPOSES

RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ENGAGE IN DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS OR ENTER INTO FURTHER LEASE AGREEMENTS.

COLLATERAL

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM HAD ACCEPTED ASSETS AS COLLATERAL THAT IT COULD SELL OR

REPLEDGE, DELIVER OR OTHERWISE USE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $655.0 BILLION AND $635.6

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COLLATERAL WAS GENERALLY OBTAINED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES

BORROWING AGREEMENTS, CUSTOMER MARGIN LOANS AND DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS. OF THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED,

APPROXIMATELY $521.3 BILLION AND $472.7 BILLION WERE SOLD OR REPLEDGED, GENERALLY AS COLLATERAL

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS OR TO COVER SHORT SALES AND TO

COLLATERALIZE DEPOSITS AND DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS. THE REPORTING OF COLLATERAL SOLD OR REPLEDGED WAS

REVISED IN 2010 TO INCLUDE CERTAIN SECURITIES USED TO COVER SHORT SALES AND TO COLLATERALIZE

DEPOSITS AND DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE

CURRENT PRESENTATION. THIS REVISION HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR ITS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

IN 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED WITH THE IRS ISSUES RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING AND WITHHOLDING

REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN ACCOUNTS TRANSFERRED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION (BNYM)

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS SALE TO BNYM OF ITS CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE

ISSUES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 32  LITIGATION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEFENDANTS OR PUTATIVE DEFENDANTS IN

MORE THAN 10,000 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THE FORM OF REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS

PRIVATE, CIVIL LITIGATIONS. THE LITIGATIONS RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS INVOLVING A SINGLE

PLAINTIFF TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WITH POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF CLASS MEMBERS. INVESTIGATIONS

INVOLVE BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS, BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS. THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE AT VARYING STAGES OF ADJUDICATION, ARBITRATION OR

INVESTIGATION, AND INVOLVE EACH OF THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND A WIDE VARIETY

OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING COMMON LAW TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AND STATUTORY ANTITRUST, SECURITIES AND

CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS), SOME OF WHICH PRESENT NOVEL CLAIMS OR LEGAL THEORIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF

RESERVES ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS FROM $0 TO

APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2010. THIS ESTIMATED AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES IS BASED UPON CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

FIRMS BEST ESTIMATE OF SUCH LOSSES FOR THOSE CASES FOR WHICH

SUCH ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE. FOR CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN CURRENTLY BE MADE. THE FIRMS

ESTIMATE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, GIVEN THE VARYING STAGES OF

THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY

IN PRELIMINARY STAGES), THE EXISTENCE OF

MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) IN MANY OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS WHOSE SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS

YET TO BE DETERMINED, THE NUMEROUS YET-UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MANY OF

THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING ISSUES REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND

THE SCOPE OF MANY OF THE CLAIMS), AND THE

ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FIRMS ESTIMATE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL LOSSES MAY BE MORE THAN THE CURRENT

ESTIMATE.

SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRMS MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MARCH 2008, SEVERAL REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS OF A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM,

CONCERNING POSSIBLE STATE AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THE MARKET FOR MANY SUCH SECURITIES HAD FROZEN AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

AUCTIONS FOR THOSE SECURITIES BEGAN TO FAIL IN FEBRUARY 2008.

THE FIRM, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND AFFILIATES, AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE NEW YORK

ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE WHICH PROVIDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE FIRM WOULD OFFER TO PURCHASE

AT PAR CERTAIN AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES PURCHASED FROM J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (JPMORGAN

SECURITIES; FORMERLY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.), CHASE INVESTMENT SERVICES CORP. AND BEAR,

STEARNS & CO. INC. BY INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, CHARITIES AND SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THE

FIRM ALSO AGREED TO A SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL

REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES ADMINISTRATOR ASSOCIATION

(NASAA) TASK FORCE, WHICH AGREED TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT TO ALL REMAINING STATES,

PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE FIRM HAS FINALIZED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE

NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA.

THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PENALTIES TOTALING $25 MILLION TO ALL STATES.

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING CONSENT AGREEMENTS WITH NASAAS MEMBER STATES;

OVER 40 OF THESE CONSENT AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED TO DATE.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES A NUMBER OF CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO THE FIRMS SALES OF AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES, INCLUDING A PUTATIVE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK THAT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, AND INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS AND

LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS FORUMS BROUGHT BY INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS THAT, TOGETHER, SEEK

DAMAGES TOTALING MORE THAN $200 MILLION RELATING TO THE FIRMS SALES OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES.

ONE ACTION IS BROUGHT BY AN ISSUER OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THE

ACTIONS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM AND OTHER FIRMS MANIPULATED THE MARKET FOR AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES BY PLACING BIDS AT AUCTIONS THAT AFFECTED THESE SECURITIES CLEARING RATES OR OTHERWISE

SUPPORTED THE AUCTIONS WITHOUT PROPERLY DISCLOSING THESE ACTIVITIES. SOME ACTIONS ALSO ALLEGE THAT

THE FIRM

MISREPRESENTED THAT AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES WERE SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM HAS

FILED MOTIONS TO DISMISS EACH OF THE ACTIONS, WHICH ARE BEING COORDINATED BEFORE THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT. THESE MOTIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM WAS NAMED IN TWO PUTATIVE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM, ALONG WITH

NUMEROUS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEFENDANTS, COLLUDED TO MAINTAIN AND STABILIZE THE

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES MARKET AND THEN TO WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES

MARKET. IN JANUARY 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED BOTH ACTIONS. THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT OF

APPEALS CONSOLIDATED THE TWO APPEALS. THAT APPEAL IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

BEAR STEARNS HEDGE FUND MATTERS.

BEAR STEARNS, CERTAIN CURRENT OR FORMER SUBSIDIARIES OF BEAR

STEARNS, INCLUDING BEAR STEARNS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. (BSAM) AND BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC., AND

CERTAIN CURRENT OR FORMER BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEES ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS (COLLECTIVELY THE BEAR

STEARNS DEFENDANTS) IN MULTIPLE CIVIL ACTIONS AND ARBITRATIONS RELATING TO ALLEGED LOSSES OF MORE

THAN $1 BILLION RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT

STRATEGIES MASTER FUND, LTD. (THE HIGH GRADE FUND) AND THE BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED

CREDIT STRATEGIES ENHANCED LEVERAGE MASTER FUND, LTD. (THE ENHANCED LEVERAGE FUND) (COLLECTIVELY,

THE FUNDS). BSAM SERVED AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR BOTH OF THE FUNDS, WHICH WERE ORGANIZED SUCH

THAT THERE WERE U.S. AND CAYMAN ISLANDS FEEDER FUNDS THAT INVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THEIR

ASSETS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE FUNDS. THE FUNDS ARE IN LIQUIDATION.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY FOUR CIVIL ACTIONS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK RELATING TO THE FUNDS. TWO OF THESE ACTIONS INVOLVE DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS

BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE TWO U.S. FEEDER FUNDS, ALLEGING

THAT THE BEAR STEARNS DEFENDANTS MISMANAGED THE FUNDS AND MADE MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS TO

AND/OR WITHHELD INFORMATION FROM INVESTORS IN THE FEEDER FUNDS. THESE ACTIONS SEEK, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BASED ON ALLEGED INVESTOR LOSSES. THE THIRD ACTION,

BROUGHT BY THE JOINT VOL-

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNTARY LIQUIDATORS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS FEEDER FUNDS, MAKES ALLEGATIONS

SIMILAR TO THOSE ASSERTED IN THE DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS RELATED TO THE U.S. FEEDER FUNDS, AND SEEKS

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. MOTIONS TO DISMISS IN THESE THREE CASES HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN

PART AND DENIED IN PART. AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN REACHED, PURSUANT TO WHICH BSAM WOULD

PAY A MAXIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION TO SETTLE THE ONE DERIVATIVE ACTION RELATING TO THE

FEEDER FUND TO THE HIGH GRADE FUND. BSAM HAS RESERVED THE RIGHT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THIS SETTLEMENT

IF PLAINTIFF IS UNABLE TO SECURE THE PARTICIPATION OF INVESTORS WHOSE NET CONTRIBUTIONS MEET A

PRESCRIBED PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE NET CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HIGH GRADE FUND. THE AGREEMENT IN

PRINCIPLE REMAINS SUBJECT TO DOCUMENTATION AND APPROVAL BY THE COURT. DISCOVERY IN THE OTHER TWO

ACTIONS IS ONGOING.

THE FOURTH ACTION WAS BROUGHT BY BANK OF AMERICA AND BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC (TOGETHER

BOFA) ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT AND FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH A MAY 2007 $4 BILLION

SECURITIZATION, KNOWN AS A CDO-SQUARED, FOR WHICH BSAM SERVED AS COLLATERAL MANAGER. THIS

SECURITIZATION WAS COMPOSED OF CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION (CDO) HOLDINGS THAT WERE

PURCHASED BY BOFA FROM THE FUNDS. BANK OF AMERICA SEEKS IN EXCESS OF $3 BILLION IN DAMAGES.

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS IN THIS ACTION WAS LARGELY DENIED, AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED AND

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS HAVE

COMMENCED PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS AND/OR

DIRECTORS ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS WHO PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OF BEAR STEARNS

BETWEEN DECEMBER 14, 2006 AND MARCH 14, 2008 (THE CLASS PERIOD). DURING THE CLASS PERIOD BEAR

STEARNS HAD BETWEEN 115 AND 120 MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, AND THE PRICE OF THOSE

SECURITIES DECLINED FROM A HIGH OF $172.61 TO A LOW OF $30 AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THE ACTIONS,

ORIGINALLY COMMENCED IN SEVERAL FEDERAL COURTS, ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS ISSUED MATERIALLY FALSE

AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING BEAR STEARNS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THAT, AS A

RESULT OF THOSE FALSE STATEMENTS, BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK TRADED AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES

DURING THE CLASS PERIOD. SEPARATELY, SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS HAVE COMMENCED

OR THREATENED TO COMMENCE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND LAWSUITS ASSERTING CLAIMS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS AND/OR

DIRECTORS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS COMMENCED IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SEEKING TO REPRESENT THE

INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) DURING THE

TIME PERIOD OF DECEMBER 2006 TO MARCH 2008. THESE ACTIONS, BROUGHT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA), ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO PLAINTIFFS

AND TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES OF THE ESOP BY (A) FAILING TO MANAGE PRUDENTLY THE

ESOPS INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS SECURITIES; (B) FAILING TO COMMUNICATE FULLY AND ACCURATELY ABOUT

THE RISKS OF THE ESOPS INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS STOCK; (C) FAILING TO AVOID OR ADDRESS

ALLEGED

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; AND (D) FAILING TO MONITOR THOSE WHO MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED THE ESOP.

BEAR STEARNS, FORMER MEMBERS OF BEAR STEARNS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF BEAR STEARNS

FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN TWO PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE SUITS, SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE ACTION, PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. PLAINTIFFS ARE ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS AND GROSS

MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION IN

CONNECTION WITH THE LOSSES SUSTAINED BY BEAR STEARNS AS A RESULT OF ITS PURCHASES OF SUBPRIME LOANS

AND CERTAIN REPURCHASES OF ITS OWN COMMON STOCK. CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALSO ALLEGED TO

HAVE SOLD THEIR HOLDINGS OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION. PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT. PLAINTIFFS LATER FILED

A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT ASSERTING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AS WELL AS

NEW ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN MARCH 2008.

ALL OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED ACTIONS FILED IN FEDERAL COURTS WERE ORDERED TRANSFERRED AND JOINED FOR

PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE PURPORTED SECURITIES CLASS ACTION, THE SHAREHOLDERS DERIVATIVE

ACTION AND THE ERISA ACTION. IN JANUARY 2011, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE

DERIVATIVE AND ERISA ACTIONS, AND DENIED THE MOTION AS TO THE SECURITIES ACTION. PLAINTIFFS IN THE

DERIVATIVE ACTION HAVE FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE DISMISSAL. DISCOVERY WILL NOW

CITY OF MILAN LITIGATION AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE CITY OF MILAN, ITALY (THE

CITY) ISSUED CIVIL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST (AMONG OTHERS) JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND J.P. MORGAN

SECURITIES LTD. (TOGETHER, JPMORGAN CHASE) IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF MILAN. THE PROCEEDINGS RELATE

TO (A) A BOND ISSUE BY THE CITY IN JUNE 2005 (THE BOND) AND (B) AN ASSOCIATED SWAP TRANSACTION, WHICH WAS

SUBSEQUENTLY RESTRUCTURED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007 (THE SWAP). THE CITY

FRAUDULENT AND DECEITFUL ACTS AND ALLEGED BREACH OF ADVISORY OBLIGATIONS BY JPMORGAN CHASE (AMONG

OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE AND THERE WILL BE AN INITIAL HEARING ON MARCH

9, 2011. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. WILL SEEK AN ADJOURNMENT ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT HAS FILED A

CHALLENGE TO THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURTS JURISDICTION OVER JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WHICH HAS YET

CHASE BANK, N.A. (AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND THREE OTHER BANKS) TO GO FORWARD TO A FULL TRIAL

THAT STARTED IN MAY 2010. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM IS NOT CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME AND DOES NOT FACE

CRIMINAL LIABILITY, IF ONE OR MORE OF ITS EMPLOYEES WERE FOUND GUILTY, THE FIRM COULD BE SUBJECT TO

ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT

OFFERING WAS A FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE. WITH RESPECT TO THE VISA IPO, PLAINTIFFS ARE CHALLENGING THE

VISA IPO ON ANTITRUST THEORIES PARALLEL TO THOSE ARTICULATED IN THE MASTERCARD IPO PLEADING.

INAPPROPRIATELY INVESTED IN SECURITIES BACKED BY SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL.

PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT JPMORGAN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED DEFENDANTS ARE LIABLE FOR LOSSES

OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION IN MARKET VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES. THE FIRST CASE WAS FILED BY NM HOMES

ONE, INC. IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW YORK, AND THE COURT GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S

MOTION TO DISMISS NINE OF PLAINTIFFS TEN CAUSES OF ACTION, LEAVING A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM. THE

COURT THEREAFTER GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND REINSTATED THE COMMON LAW

NON-FRAUD CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, NEGLIGENCE, AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE PLAINTIFF

WITHDREW ITS CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION. THE FIRM HAS FILED A RENEWED MOTION TO DISMISS

THE COMMON LAW NON-FRAUD CLAIMS AND A MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS AS TO THE BREACH OF

CONTRACT CLAIM. IN THE SECOND CASE, WHICH WAS FILED BY ASSURED GUARANTY (U.K.) IN NEW YORK STATE

COURT, THE NEW YORK STATE APPELLATE DIVISION ALLOWED PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH ITS CLAIMS FOR

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE, AND FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT BASED ON ALLEGED

VIOLATIONS OF THE DELAWARE INSURANCE CODE. THE FIRM SOUGHT AND HAS OBTAINED LEAVE TO APPEAL TO THE

FIDUCIARY DUTY AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS TO PROCEED. IN THE THIRD CASE, FILED BY AMBAC ASSURANCE

LEHMAN BROTHERS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

IN MARCH 2010, THE EXAMINER APPOINTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT PRESIDING OVER THE CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC (LBHI)

AND SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, LEHMAN) RELEASED A REPORT AS TO HIS INVESTIGATION

INTO LEHMANS FAILURE AND RELATED MATTERS. THE EXAMINER CONCLUDED THAT ONE COMMON LAW CLAIM

POTENTIALLY COULD BE ASSERTED AGAINST THE FIRM FOR CONTRIBUTING TO LEHMANS FAILURE, THOUGH HE

CHARACTERIZED THE CLAIM AS NOT STRONG. THE EXAMINER ALSO OPINED THAT CERTAIN CASH AND SECURITIES

COLLATERAL PROVIDED BY LBHI TO THE FIRM IN THE WEEKS AND DAYS PRECEDING LBHIS DEMISE POTENTIALLY

COULD BE CHALLENGED UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODES FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE OR PREFERENCE PROVISIONS,

THOUGH THE FIRM IS OF THE VIEW THAT ITS RIGHT TO SUCH COLLATERAL IS PROTECTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY

CODES SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS. IN MAY 2010, LBHI AND ITS OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS

FILED AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE COMPLAINT ASSERTS BOTH FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW AND

STATE COMMON LAW CLAIMS, AND SEEKS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF, TO RECOVER $8.6 BILLION IN COLLATERAL THAT

WAS TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A. IN THE WEEK PRECEDING LBHIS BANKRUPTCY. THE COMPLAINT

ALSO SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON THE GROUNDS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S COLLATERAL REQUESTS

HASTENED LBHIS DEMISE. THE FIRM HAS MOVED TO

DISMISS PLAINTIFFS AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE FIRM ALSO FILED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST

LBHI ALLEGING THAT LBHI FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED THE FIRM TO MAKE LARGE CLEARING ADVANCES TO LEHMAN

AGAINST INAPPROPRIATE COLLATERAL, WHICH LEFT THE FIRM WITH MORE THAN $25 BILLION IN CLAIMS AGAINST

THE ESTATE OF LEHMANS BROKER-DEALER, WHICH COULD BE UNPAID IF THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO RETURN ANY

COLLATERAL TO LEHMAN. THE CASE IS IN THE EARLY STAGES, WITH A TRIAL SCHEDULED FOR 2012. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ALSO FACE CLAIMS IN THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDING PENDING BEFORE THE SAME

BANKRUPTCY COURT UNDER THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT (SIPA) FOR LBHIS U.S.

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. (LBI). THE SIPA TRUSTEE HAS ADVISED THE FIRM THAT

CERTAIN OF THE SECURITIES AND CASH PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE FIRMS CLAIMS AGAINST LBI MAY BE

CUSTOMER PROPERTY FREE FROM ANY SECURITY INTEREST IN FAVOR OF THE

FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RESPONDED TO VARIOUS REGULATORY INQUIRIES

REGARDING THE LEHMAN MATTER.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THE ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM SOLELY AS AN UNDERWRITER OF OTHER ISSUERS MBS OFFERINGS, THE FIRM

HAS CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE ISSUERS, BUT THOSE INDEMNITY RIGHTS MAY PROVE

EFFECTIVELY UNENFORCEABLE WHERE THE ISSUERS ARE NOW DEFUNCT, SUCH AS AFFILIATES OF INDYMAC BANCORP

(INDYMAC TRUSTS) AND THORNBURG MORTGAGE (THORNBURG). WITH RESPECT TO THE INDYMAC TRUSTS,

JPMORGAN SECURITIES, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER UNDERWRITERS AND INDIVIDUALS, IS NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT, BOTH IN ITS OWN CAPACITY AND AS SUCCESSOR TO BEAR STEARNS IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION

PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BROUGHT ON BEHALF

OF PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES IN VARIOUS INDYMAC TRUST MBS OFFERINGS. THE COURT IN THAT ACTION HAS

DISMISSED CLAIMS AS TO CERTAIN SUCH SECURITIZATIONS, INCLUDING ALL OFFERINGS IN WHICH NO NAMED

PLAINTIFF PURCHASED SECURITIES, AND ALLOWED CLAIMS AS TO OTHER OFFERINGS TO PROCEED. PLAINTIFFS

MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF INVESTORS IN CERTAIN OFFERINGS IS PENDING, AND DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND JPMORGAN CHASE ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION

FILED BY THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF PITTSBURGH IN CONNECTION WITH A SINGLE OFFERING BY AN

AFFILIATE OF INDYMAC BANCORP. DISCOVERY IN THAT ACTION IS ONGOING. SEPARATELY, JPMORGAN SECURITIES,

AS SUCCESSOR TO BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC., ALONG WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS,

ARE DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION PENDING IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA BROUGHT BY MBIA INSURANCE CORP.

(MBIA). THE ACTION RELATES TO CERTAIN SECURITIES ISSUED BY INDYMAC TRUSTS IN OFFERINGS IN WHICH

BEAR STEARNS WAS AN UNDERWRITER, AND AS TO WHICH MBIA PROVIDED GUARANTY INSURANCE POLICIES. MBIA

PURPORTS TO BE SUBROGATED

TO THE RIGHTS OF THE MBS HOLDERS, AND SEEKS RECOVERY OF SUMS IT HAS PAID AND WILL PAY PURSUANT TO

THOSE POLICIES. DISCOVERY IS ONGOING. WITH RESPECT TO THORNBURG, A BEAR STEARNS SUBSIDIARY IS A

NAMED DEFENDANT IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVED AS

DEPOSITORS AND/OR UNDERWRITERS FOR THREE THORNBURG MBS OFFERINGS.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED LITIGATION, THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECEIVED, AND RESPONDED TO, A

NUMBER OF SUBPOENAS AND INFORMAL REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITIES CONCERNING

MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, INCLUDING INQUIRIES CONCERNING A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE

FIRMS UNDERWRITING AND ISSUANCE OF MBS AND ITS PARTICIPATION IN OFFERINGS OF CERTAIN

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS, THE FIRM IS NOW A DEFENDANT IN AN ACTION

COMMENCED BY DEUTSCHE BANK, DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

LITIGATIONS.

MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE

ANNOUNCED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY MORTGAGE SERVICING COMPANIES AND BANKS,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS AFFILIATES, RELATING TO FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION PROCESSES. THE FIRM IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS, AND THESE INVESTIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL FINES, PENALTIES, EQUITABLE REMEDIES (INCLUDING REQUIRING DEFAULT SERVICING OR OTHER PROCESS CHANGES), OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL COSTS IN RESPONDING TO GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ADDITIONAL LITIGATION. THREE PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED

AGAINST THE FIRM RELATING TO ITS MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES.

THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ACTIONS FOLLOW THE FIRMS DECISION IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2010 TO COMMENCE A

TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF OBTAINING

MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE JUDGMENTS IN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT

REQUIRE A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM EXTENDED THIS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION

TO FORECLOSURE SALES IN THOSE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT REQUIRE A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS,

AND TO FORECLOSURES AND FORECLOSURE SALES IN THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING STATES WHERE A JUDICIAL

PROCESS IS NOT REQUIRED, BUT WHERE AFFIDAVITS SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS PART

OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS. IN MID-OCTOBER, THE FIRM ALSO TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED EVICTIONS IN THE

STATES AND TERRITORIES IN WHICH IT HAD SUSPENDED FORECLOSURES AND FORECLOSURE SALES, AS WELL AS IN

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL STATES IN WHICH AN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN

CONNECTION WITH EVICTION PROCEEDINGS.

THE FIRMS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION AROSE OUT OF CERTAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS

PREPARED BY LOCAL FORECLOSURE COUNSEL, SIGNED BY FIRM EMPLOYEES AND FILED OR USED IN MORTGAGE

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS IN CERTAIN STATES. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM BELIEVES, BASED ON ITS WORK TO DATE,

THAT THE STATEMENTS IN THOSE AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS REGARDING THE FACT OF DEFAULT AND AMOUNT OF

INDEBTEDNESS WERE MATERIALLY ACCURATE, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE UNDERLYING REVIEW AND VERIFICATION

OF THIS INFORMATION WAS PERFORMED BY FIRM PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THE AFFIANTS, OR THE AFFIDAVITS MAY

NOT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY NOTARIZED.

AS OF JANUARY 2011, THE FIRM HAS RESUMED INITIATION OF NEW FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS IN NEARLY ALL

STATES IN WHICH IT HAD PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED SUCH PROCEEDINGS, UTILIZING REVISED PROCEDURES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE EXECUTION OF AFFIDAVITS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS USED BY FIRM EMPLOYEES IN THE

FORECLOSURE PROCESS. THE FIRM IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING PENDING FORECLOSURE MATTERS IN

THESE STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER REMEDIATION OF SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION IS NECESSARY, AND INTENDS

TO RESUME PENDING FORECLOSURES AS THE REVIEW, AND IF NECESSARY, REMEDIATION, OF EACH PENDING MATTER

IS COMPLETED. THE FIRM INTENDS TO BEGIN TAKING THESE SAME ACTIONS IN ALL REMAINING STATES IN THE

NEAR FUTURE.

MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE), THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), A GROUP OF STATE

ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND THE OFFICE

OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS

FOR POSSIBLE ANTITRUST, SECURITIES AND TAX-RELATED VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING OR

SALE OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND DERIVATIVES TO MUNICIPAL ISSUERS. THE PHILADELPHIA

OFFICE OF THE SEC PROVIDED NOTICE TO JPMORGAN SECURITIES THAT IT INTENDS TO RECOMMEND THAT THE SEC

BRING CIVIL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INVESTIGATION. JPMORGAN SECURITIES HAS RESPONDED TO THAT

NOTICE, AS WELL AS TO A SEPARATE NOTICE THAT THAT PHILADELPHIA OFFICE OF THE SEC PROVIDED TO BEAR,

STEARNS & CO. INC. THE FIRM HAS BEEN COOPERATING WITH ALL OF

THESE INVESTIGATIONS, AND IS SEEKING

TO RESOLVE THEM ON A NEGOTIATED BASIS.

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS (THE MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES ACTIONS) HAVE

BEEN FILED AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR STEARNS, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVIDERS AND

BROKERS, ALLEGING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS IN THE REPORTEDLY $100 BILLION TO $300 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET

FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO MUNICIPAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BOND OFFERINGS REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS

MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES. THE MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE COURT DENIED IN PART AND GRANTED

IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE PURPORTED CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS, PERMITTING

CERTAIN CLAIMS TO PROCEED AGAINST THE FIRM AND OTHERS UNDER FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA STATE ANTITRUST

LAWS AND UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT. SUBSEQUENTLY, A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL

ACTIONS ASSERTING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS UNDER NEW YORK AND WEST VIRGINIA

STATE ANTITRUST STATUTES, WERE FILED AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE, BEAR STEARNS AND NUMEROUS OTHER

DEFENDANTS. MOST OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN COORDINATED FOR PRETRIAL PURPOSES IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE FIRM IS SEEKING TO HAVE THE BALANCE OF

THESE CASES COORDINATED BEFORE THE SAME COURT. DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

FOLLOWING JPMORGAN SECURITIES SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN JEFFERSON COUNTY,

ALABAMA (THE COUNTY) WARRANT UNDERWRITINGS AND SWAP TRANSACTIONS, THE COUNTY FILED A COMPLAINT

AGAINST THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, ALABAMA.

THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE FIRM MADE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES IN EXCHANGE FOR BEING CHOSEN

TO UNDERWRITE MORE THAN $3 BILLION IN WARRANTS ISSUED BY THE COUNTY AND CHOSEN AS THE COUNTERPARTY

FOR CERTAIN SWAPS EXECUTED BY THE COUNTY. IN ITS COMPLAINT, JEFFERSON COUNTY ALLEGES THAT THE FIRM

CONCEALED THESE THIRD-PARTY PAYMENTS AND THAT, BUT FOR THIS CONCEALMENT, THE COUNTY WOULD NOT HAVE

ENTERED INTO THE TRANSACTIONS. THE COUNTY FURTHER ALLEGES THAT THE TRANSACTIONS INCREASED THE RISKS

OF ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND THAT, FOLLOWING THE DOWNGRADE OF CERTAIN INSURERS THAT INSURED THE

WARRANTS, THE COUNTYS INTEREST OBLIGATIONS INCREASED AND THE PRINCIPAL DUE ON A PORTION OF ITS

OUTSTANDING WARRANTS WAS ACCELERATED. THE COURT DENIED THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

THE FIRM FILED A MANDAMUS PETITION WITH THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT, SEEKING IMMEDIATE APPELLATE

REVIEW OF THIS DECISION. THE PETITION IS NOW FULLY BRIEFED AND ALL PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN STAYED

PENDING ADJUDICATION OF THE PETITION.

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION WAS FILED ON BEHALF OF SEWER RATEPAYERS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR

STEARNS AND NUMEROUS OTHER DEFENDANTS, BASED ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGED CONDUCT DESCRIBED

ABOVE. THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR LACK OF STANDING WAS DENIED IN JANUARY 2011.

TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON WARRANTS ISSUED BY

JEFFERSON COUNTY HAVE FILED SEPARATE ACTIONS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE (AND ONE OF THE INSURERS HAS

ALSO NAMED JEFFERSON COUNTY) IN NEW YORK STATE COURT ASSERTING THAT DEFENDANTS FRAUDULENTLY MISLED

THEM INTO ISSUING THE INSURANCE COVERAGE, BASED UPON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGED CONDUCT

DESCRIBED ABOVE AND OTHER ALLEGED NON-DISCLOSURES. ONE INSURER CLAIMS THAT IT INSURED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NEARLY $1.2

BILLION IN WARRANTS, AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $400 MILLION, AS WELL AS

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE OTHER INSURER CLAIMS THAT IT INSURED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF MORE THAN $378 MILLION AND SEEKS RECOVERY OF $4 MILLION THAT IT ALLEGES IT PAID UNDER THE

POLICIES TO DATE AS WELL AS ANY PAYMENTS IT WILL MAKE IN THE FUTURE AND UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE

DAMAGES. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COURT DENIED THE FIRMS MOTIONS TO DISMISS EACH OF THE COMPLAINTS

AND THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DISCOVERY.

THE

ALABAMA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE AUTHORITY (APSCA)

BROUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA CLAIMING THAT CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE SWAPTION TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ARE VOID ON THE

GROUNDS THAT THE APSCA PURPORTEDLY DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TRANSACTIONS OR,

ALTERNATIVELY, ARE VOIDABLE AT THE APSCAS OPTION BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGED INABILITY TO ISSUE

REFUNDING BONDS IN RELATION TO THE SWAPTION. THE ACTION WAS SETTLED IN DECEMBER 2010 FOR A PAYMENT

BY APSCA TO THE FIRM AND, PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT, THE COURT DISMISSED THE ACTION BY ORDER DATED

DECEMBER 27, 2010.

OVERDRAFT FEE/DEBIT POSTING ORDER LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. HAS BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS RELATING TO ITS PRACTICES IN POSTING DEBIT CARD

TRANSACTIONS TO CUSTOMERS DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM IMPROPERLY RE-ORDERED

DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE HIGHEST AMOUNT TO LOWEST AMOUNT BEFORE PROCESSING THESE

TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO GENERATE UNWARRANTED OVERDRAFT FEES. PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT THE FIRM

SHOULD HAVE PROCESSED SUCH TRANSACTIONS IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER THEY WERE AUTHORIZED. PLAINTIFFS

SEEK THE DISGORGEMENT OF ALL OVERDRAFT FEES PAID TO THE FIRM BY PLAINTIFFS, SINCE APPROXIMATELY

2003, AS A RESULT OF THE RE-ORDERING OF DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE FIRM HAVE

BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL BANKS IN MULTI-DISTRICT

LITIGATION PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA. THE

FIRMS MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OF CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.

THAT RULING IS CURRENTLY ON APPEAL. DISCOVERY IS PROCEEDING IN THE DISTRICT COURT. PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION IS DUE TO BE FILED IN APRIL 2011.

PETTERS BANKRUPTCY AND RELATED MATTERS.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING ONE

EQUITY PARTNERS, LLC (OEP), HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN SEVERAL ACTIONS FILED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE RECEIVERSHIP AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS PERTAINING TO THOMAS J. PETTERS AND CERTAIN

ENTITIES AFFILIATED WITH PETTERS (COLLECTIVELY, PETTERS) AND THE POLAROID CORPORATION. THE

PRINCIPAL ACTIONS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY THE RECEIVER AND

BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE FOR PETTERS AND GENERALLY SEEK TO AVOID, ON FRAUDULENT TRANSFER AND PREFERENCE

GROUNDS, CERTAIN PURPORTED TRANSFERS IN CONNECTION WITH (I) THE 2005 ACQUISITION OF POLAROID BY

PETTERS, WHICH AT THE TIME WAS MAJORITY-OWNED BY OEP; (II) TWO CREDIT FACILITIES THAT JPMORGAN

CHASE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH POLAROID; AND (III) A CREDIT LINE AND

INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS HELD BY PETTERS. THE ACTIONS COLLECTIVELY SEEK RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY $450

MILLION.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN FOUR

STATE COURT BY AN INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT IN THE

PROGRAM. THREE OF THE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, RELATE TO INVESTMENTS

OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES OF SIGMA FINANCE INC. (SIGMA). IN AUGUST 2010,

THE COURT CERTIFIED A PLAINTIFF CLASS CONSISTING OF ALL SECURITIES LENDING PARTICIPANTS THAT HELD

SIGMA MEDIUM-TERM NOTES ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HELD THE NOTES BY VIRTUE OF

PARTICIPATION IN THE INVESTMENT OF CASH COLLATERAL THROUGH A COLLECTIVE FUND, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT

HELD THE NOTES BY VIRTUE OF THE INVESTMENT OF CASH COLLATERAL THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS. ALL

DISCOVERY HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE COURT HAS SET A SCHEDULE FOR FILING SUMMARY JUDGMENT BRIEFS,

PURSUANT TO WHICH THE FIRMS MOTION IS TO BE FULLY BRIEFED BY APRIL 2011.

THE FOURTH PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CONCERNS INVESTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION IN LEHMAN

BROTHERS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. THE FIRM HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT AND IS AWAITING A

DECISION. THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE ORDERED DISCOVERY TO PROCEED WHILE THE MOTION IS PENDING, BUT THIS

RULING IS ON APPEAL TO THE DISTRICT JUDGE AND ALSO IS AWAITING A DECISION. THE NEW YORK STATE COURT

ACTION, WHICH IS NOT A CLASS ACTION, CONCERNS THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED LOSS OF MONEY IN BOTH SIGMA

AND LEHMAN BROTHERS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. THE FIRM HAS ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT. THE COURT DENIED THE

FIRMS MOTION TO STAY THIS ACTION PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN FEDERAL COURT

,

AND

DISCOVERY HAS COMMENCED.

SERVICE MEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT AND HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT INVESTIGATIONS AND

LITIGATION.

MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT TO COMMENCE, OR HAVE

COMMENCED, INQUIRIES INTO THE FIRMS PROCEDURES RELATED TO THE SERVICE MEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF ACT

(SCRA) AND THE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 (HERA). THESE INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN

PROMPTED BY THE FIRMS PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS SCRA AND HERA COMPLIANCE AND ACTIONS TO REMEDY

CERTAIN INSTANCES IN WHICH THE FIRM MISTAKENLY CHARGED ACTIVE OR RECENTLY-ACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL

MORTGAGE INTEREST AND FEES IN EXCESS OF THAT PERMITTED BY SCRA AND HERA, AND IN A NUMBER OF

INSTANCES, FORECLOSED ON BORROWERS PROTECTED BY SCRA AND HERA. THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF

PROCEDURAL ENHANCEMENTS AND CONTROLS TO STRENGTHEN ITS SCRA AND HERA COMPLIANCE AND IS STILL

REVIEWING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THESE ISSUES AROSE. IN ADDITION, AN INDIVIDUAL BORROWER HAS

FILED A PURPORTED NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR SOUTH CAROLINA

AGAINST THE FIRM ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SCRA.

WASHINGTON MUTUAL LITIGATIONS.

SUBSEQUENT TO JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITION FROM THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS AND CERTAIN SPECIFIED LIABILITIES

OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK, HENDERSON NEVADA (WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK), IN SEPTEMBER 2008,

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. (WMI) AND ITS

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, WMI INVESTMENT CORP. (TOGETHER, THE DEBTORS), BOTH COMMENCED VOLUNTARY

CASES UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (THE BANKRUPTCY CASE). IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE, THE DEBTORS HAVE

ASSERTED RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN CERTAIN ASSETS. THE ASSETS IN DISPUTE INCLUDE PRINCIPALLY

THE

FOLLOWING: (A) APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN TRUST SECURITIES CONTRIBUTED BY WMI TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL

BANK (THE TRUST SECURITIES); (B) THE RIGHT TO TAX REFUNDS ARISING FROM OVERPAYMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES; (C) OWNERSHIP OF AND OTHER RIGHTS IN

APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION THAT WMI CONTENDS ARE DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AT WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK AND ONE

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES; AND (D) OWNERSHIP OF AND RIGHTS IN VARIOUS OTHER CONTRACTS AND OTHER ASSETS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE DISPUTED ASSETS).

WMI, JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC HAVE SINCE BEEN INVOLVED IN LITIGATIONS OVER THESE AND OTHER

CLAIMS PENDING IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA.

IN MAY 2010, WMI, JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AMONG

THEMSELVES AND SIGNIFICANT CREDITOR GROUPS (THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT). THE GLOBAL

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS INCORPORATED INTO WMIS PROPOSED CHAPTER 11 PLAN (THE PLAN) THAT HAS

BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IF APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT

WOULD RESOLVE NUMEROUS DISPUTES AMONG WMI, JPMORGAN CHASE, THE FDIC IN ITS CAPACITY AS RECEIVER FOR

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK AND THE FDIC IN ITS CORPORATE CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THOSE OF SIGNIFICANT

CREDITOR GROUPS, INCLUDING DISPUTES RELATING TO THE DISPUTED ASSETS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUALS FAILURE ARE ALSO PENDING BEFORE THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT. AMONG OTHER ACTIONS, IN JULY 2010, CERTAIN HOLDERS OF THE TRUST SECURITIES COMMENCED AN

ADVERSARY PROCEEDING IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE, WMI, AND OTHER ENTITIES

SEEKING, AMONG OTHER RELIEF, A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WMI AND JPMORGAN CHASE DO NOT HAVE ANY

RIGHT, TITLE OR INTEREST IN THE TRUST SECURITIES. IN EARLY JANUARY 2011, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO JPMORGAN CHASE AND DENIED SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

TRUST SECURITIES ADVERSARY PROCEEDING.

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CONSIDERED CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN, INCLUDING THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, IN HEARINGS IN EARLY DECEMBER 2010. IN EARLY JANUARY 2011, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED

AN OPINION IN WHICH IT CONCLUDED THAT THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE, BUT

THAT THE PLAN CANNOT BE CONFIRMED UNTIL THE PARTIES CORRECT CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES, WHICH INCLUDE THE

SCOPE OF RELEASES. NONE OF THESE DEFICIENCIES RELATE TO THE DISPUTED ASSETS. THE EQUITY COMMITTEE

HAS FILED A PETITION SEEKING A DIRECT APPEAL TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD

CIRCUIT FROM SO MUCH OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS RULING THAT FOUND THE SETTLEMENT TO BE FAIR AND

REASONABLE. A REVISED PLAN WAS FILED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN FEBRUARY 2011, AND THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING FOR MAY 2, 2011. IF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT IS EFFECTED AND THE PLAN IS

CONFIRMED, THE FIRM CURRENTLY ESTIMATES IT WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS BEYOND THOSE

ALREADY REFLECTED IN ITS LIABILITIES FOR THE NUMEROUS DISPUTES COVERED BY THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUALS FAILURE ARE PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA INCLUDE A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL

TRUST COMPANY, INITIALLY AGAINST THE FDIC, ASSERTING AN ESTIMATED $6 BILLION TO $10 BILLION IN

DAMAGES BASED UPON ALLEGED BREACH OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS AND ALLEGED

VIOLATION OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN BY CERTAIN WMI SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION

WITH THOSE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. DEUTSCHE BANK FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN AUGUST 2010,

ADDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AS A PARTY. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT INCLUDES ASSERTIONS THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY HAVE ASSUMED LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. IN

NOVEMBER 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO

MOVED FOR A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT HOLDING THAT THE FDIC RETAINED LIABILITY FOR DEUTSCHE BANKS

CLAIMS.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE WAS SUED IN AN ACTION ORIGINALLY FILED IN STATE DISTRICT COURT IN TEXAS

(THE TEXAS ACTION) BY CERTAIN HOLDERS OF WMI COMMON STOCK AND DEBT OF WMI AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL

BANK WHO SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ALLEGING THAT JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

ASSETS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK FROM THE FDIC AT AN ALLEGEDLY TOO-LOW PRICE. THE TEXAS ACTION WAS

TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHICH ULTIMATELY

GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASES AND THE FDICS MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED

THIS DISMISSAL TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT. ORAL

ARGUMENT IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 5, 2011.

*      *       *

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES

TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IT INTENDS TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN ALL SUCH MATTERS. ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED OF ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. THE FIRM ACCRUES FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM SUCH PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EACH QUARTER TO ASSESS ITS

LITIGATION RESERVES, AND MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IN SUCH RESERVES, UPWARDS OR DOWNWARDS, AS APPROPRIATE,

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST JUDGMENT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE FIRM INCURRED $7.4 BILLION AND $161 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

LITIGATION EXPENSE. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FIRM RECORDED A NET BENEFIT OF $781 MILLION TO LITIGATION EXPENSE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS LITIGATION RESERVES WILL

NOT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY

WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE MATTERS PRESENT NOVEL

LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM

CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE CURRENTLY PENDING MATTERS WILL BE,

WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL

LOSS, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO EACH CURRENTLY PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE

BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT

SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FIRM

NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES

CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE FIRMS SEGMENT RESULTS FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008 ON A

MANAGED BASIS. PRIOR TO THE JANUARY 1, 2010, ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES,

THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN RECONCILING ITEMS SO THAT

THE TOTAL FIRM RESULTS ARE ON A REPORTED BASIS. FINALLY, TOTAL NET REVENUE (NONINTEREST REVENUE AND

NET INTEREST INCOME) FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS IS PRESENTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCORDINGLY,

REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS ARE PRESENTED IN THE

MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS

MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES.

THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX

EXPENSE/(BENEFIT).

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL

FROM THE FDIC FOR $1.9 BILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED EXCEEDED THE

PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE, SUCH AS PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST

THAT NEGATIVE GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER WRITING DOWN NONFINANCIAL

ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN.

(F)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO VIES. PRIOR TO THE

ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, MANAGED RESULTS FOR CREDIT CARD EXCLUDED THE IMPACT OF CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON TOTAL NET REVENUE, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AVERAGE ASSETS, AS

JPMORGAN CHASE TREATED THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN

EVALUATING THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, AS OPERATIONS

ARE FUNDED, AND DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL,

BASED ON MANAGED INFORMATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ELIMINATED IN RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE

AT THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. THE RELATED SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD LOANS

FROM THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED BY WMMT. AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT QUALITY CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK

RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE

OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO

THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 244259 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(A)

PRE-PROVISION PROFIT IS TOTAL NET REVENUE LESS NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE FIRM BELIEVES

THAT THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL IN ASSESSING THE ABILITY OF A LENDING INSTITUTION TO

GENERATE INCOME IN EXCESS OF ITS PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

(B)

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL.

ON MAY 30, 2008, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE MERGED WITH AND INTO THE BEAR

STEARNS COMPANIES, INC. (BEAR STEARNS), AND BEAR STEARNS BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL ACQUISITION RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL, AND

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM RECORDED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. A PRELIMINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FINAL TOTAL EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS $2.0 BILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 166170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(C)

THE CALCULATION OF SECOND-QUARTER 2009 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON

EQUITY INCLUDES A ONE-TIME, NONCASH REDUCTION OF $1.1 BILLION, OR $0.27 PER SHARE, RESULTING

FROM REPAYMENT OF U.S. TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (TARP) PREFERRED CAPITAL. EXCLUDING

THIS REDUCTION, THE ADJUSTED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY (ROE) AND RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON

EQUITY (ROTCE) WERE 6% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SECOND-QUARTER 2009. THE FIRM VIEWS THE

ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE, BOTH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY ENABLE

THE COMPARABILITY TO PRIOR PERIODS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE EXPLANATION AND

RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES ON PAGE 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

(D)

SHARE PRICES SHOWN FOR JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ARE FROM THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK IS ALSO LISTED AND TRADED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE

TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE.

(E)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE THAT AMENDED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE

TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, FIRM-ADMINISTERED

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOAN SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, PRIMARILY

MORTGAGE-RELATED, ADDING $87.7 BILLION AND $92.2 BILLION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASING STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO BY $4.5 BILLION

AND 34 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS DRIVEN BY THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $7.5 BILLION (PRETAX) PRIMARILY RELATED TO

RECEIVABLES HELD IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED AT THE ADOPTION

DATE.

(F)

THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS

CAPITAL POSITION. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO IS TIER 1 COMMON DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES 102104 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(G)

EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF HOME LENDING PCI LOANS AND LOANS HELD BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER

TRUST. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON PAGES 139141 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

(H)

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 INCLUDES AN AGGREGATE ADJUSTMENT OF $632 MILLION TO INCREASE NET CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING DELINQUENT RESIDENTIAL HOME LOANS. BECAUSE THESE LOSSES WERE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, THIS ADJUSTMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRMS NET INCOME.

PRE-PROVISION PROFIT IS TOTAL NET REVENUE LESS NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL IN ASSESSING THE ABILITY OF A LENDING

INSTITUTION TO GENERATE INCOME IN EXCESS OF ITS PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

(B)

RESULTS FOR 2008 INCLUDED AN ACCOUNTING CONFORMITY LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROVISION RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS BANKING OPERATIONS.

(C)

ON OCTOBER 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. COMPLETED THE EXCHANGE OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST

BUSINESSES FOR THE CONSUMER, BUSINESS-BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING BUSINESSES OF THE BANK

OF NEW YORK COMPANY INC. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THESE CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES WERE

REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

(D)

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL.

ON MAY 30, 2008, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE MERGED WITH AND INTO BEAR

STEARNS, AND BEAR STEARNS BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL ACQUISITION RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM RECORDED AN

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. A PRELIMINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION WAS RECOGNIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE FINAL TOTAL EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS

$2.0 BILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS,

SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 166170

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(E)

THE CALCULATION OF 2009 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON EQUITY

INCLUDES A ONE-TIME, NONCASH REDUCTION OF $1.1 BILLION, OR $0.27 PER SHARE, RESULTING FROM

REPAYMENT OF TARP PREFERRED CAPITAL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. EXCLUDING THIS REDUCTION,

THE ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) AND RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (ROTCE) WERE 7%

AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2009. THE FIRM VIEWS THE ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE, BOTH NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY ENABLE THE COMPARABILITY TO PRIOR PERIODS. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 6466 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(F)

SHARE PRICES SHOWN FOR JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ARE FROM THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK IS ALSO LISTED AND TRADED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE

TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE.

(G)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FIRM ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE THAT AMENDED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE

TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE,

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED ITS FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, FIRM-ADMINISTERED

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOAN SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, PRIMARILY

MORTGAGE-RELATED, ADDING $87.7 BILLION AND $92.2 BILLION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASING STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO BY $4.5 BILLION

AND 34 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS DRIVEN BY THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $7.5 BILLION (PRETAX) PRIMARILY RELATED TO

RECEIVABLES HELD IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED AT THE ADOPTION

DATE.

(H)

THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS

CAPITAL POSITION. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO IS TIER 1 COMMON DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES 102104 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(I)

EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF HOME LENDING PCI LOANS AND LOANS HELD BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL MASTER

TRUST. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

ON THE ACTUAL APPRAISED VALUES OF COLLATERAL (I.E., LOAN-LEVEL DATA) AT THE ORIGINATION DATE.

CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO

AN ESTIMATE OF THE LTV AS OF A CERTAIN DATE. THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS ARE CALCULATED USING

ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES DERIVED FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURED AT THE

MSA LEVEL. THESE MSA-LEVEL HOME PRICE INDICES COMPRISE ACTUAL DATA TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE AND

FORECASTED DATA WHERE ACTUAL DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES

USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES; AS

SUCH, THE RESULTING LTV RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS

ESTIMATES.

2010, ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATING TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. MANAGEMENT USES THIS

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THIS PROVIDES INFORMATION TO

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FACILITATES A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF

COMPETITORS.

NEGATIVE, JPMORGAN CHASE OWES THE COUNTERPARTY; IN THIS SITUATION, THE FIRM HAS LIQUIDITY RISK.

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT.

AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO COUNTERPARTIES WHO HAVE MULTIPLE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS WITH EACH OTHER THAT PROVIDES FOR THE NET SETTLEMENT OF ALL CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS CASH

MORTGAGE PRODUCT TYPES.

ALT-A

ALT-A LOANS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN CREDIT QUALITY THAN SUBPRIME LOANS BUT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS

THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY THE BORROWER FROM A TRADITIONAL PRIME LOAN. ALT-A LENDING CHARACTERISTICS MAY

INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (I) LIMITED DOCUMENTATION; (II) HIGH COMBINED-LOAN-TO-VALUE

(CLTV) RATIO; (III) LOANS SECURED BY NON-OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES; OR (IV) DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO

ABOVE NORMAL LIMITS. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC IS LIMITED DOCUMENTATION. A

SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF TRADITIONAL ALT-A LOANS ARE THOSE WHERE A BORROWER DOES NOT PROVIDE

COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF HIS OR HER ASSETS OR THE AMOUNT OR SOURCE OF HIS OR HER INCOME.

OPTION ARMS

THE OPTION ARM REAL ESTATE LOAN PRODUCT IS AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN THAT PROVIDES THE

BORROWER WITH THE OPTION EACH MONTH TO MAKE A FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY, OR MINIMUM PAYMENT.

THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON AN OPTION ARM LOAN IS BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE

INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE IS USUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED RATE.

THE FULLY INDEXED RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN INDEX RATE PLUS A MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY

PERIOD ENDS, THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON THE LOAN INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE

AND ADJUSTS MONTHLY TO REFLECT MOVEMENTS IN THE INDEX. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY

INSUFFICIENT TO COVER INTEREST ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR MONTH, AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IS DEFERRED AND

ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN. OPTION ARM LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT RECAST, WHICH

CONVERTS THE LOAN TO A VARIABLE-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN UPON MEETING SPECIFIED LOAN BALANCE AND

ANNIVERSARY DATE TRIGGERS.

PRIME

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS GENERALLY HAVE LOW DEFAULT RISK AND ARE MADE TO BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT

RECORDS AND A MONTHLY INCOME THAT IS AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THEIR MONTHLY

HOUSING EXPENSE (MORTGAGE PAYMENTS PLUS TAXES AND OTHER DEBT PAYMENTS). THESE BORROWERS PROVIDE

FULL DOCUMENTATION AND GENERALLY HAVE RELIABLE PAYMENT HISTORIES.

SUBPRIME

SUBPRIME LOANS ARE DESIGNED FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ONE OR MORE HIGH RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BUT

NOT LIMITED TO: (I) UNRELIABLE OR POOR PAYMENT HISTORIES; (II) A HIGH LTV RATIO OF GREATER THAN 80%

(WITHOUT BORROWER-PAID MORTGAGE INSURANCE); (III) A HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO; (IV) AN OCCUPANCY

TYPE FOR THE LOAN IS OTHER THAN THE BORROWERS PRIMARY RESIDENCE; OR (V) A HISTORY OF DELINQUENCIES

OR LATE PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.

MSR RISK MANAGEMENT REVENUE.

INCLUDES CHANGES IN MSR ASSET FAIR VALUE DUE TO MARKET-BASED INPUTS,

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH

ENTITLE THE RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE NONFORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD ON A BASIS

EQUIVALENT TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. THESE UNVESTED AWARDS MEET THE

DEFINITION OF PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD, ALL EARNINGS (DISTRIBUTED AND

UNDISTRIBUTED) ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH CLASS OF COMMON STOCK AND PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, BASED ON

THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS.

PERSONAL BANKERS.

RETAIL BRANCH OFFICE PERSONNEL WHO ACQUIRE, RETAIN AND EXPAND NEW AND EXISTING

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS BY ASSESSING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND RECOMMENDING AND SELLING APPROPRIATE BANKING

AND LOSSES.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS.

ACQUIRED LOANS DEEMED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED UNDER THE FASB

GUIDANCE FOR PCI LOANS. THE GUIDANCE ALLOWS PURCHASERS TO AGGREGATE CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED

IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK

CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., FICO SCORE, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION). A POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE

ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WHOLESALE

LOANS ARE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED IF THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN IMPAIRED LOAN UNDER

U.S. GAAP AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. CONSUMER LOANS ARE DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED BASED ON

SPECIFIC RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOAN, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LTV RATIOS, FICO SCORES, AND

PAST DUE STATUS.

IMPACT OF NONACCRUAL LOANS AND ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS ON INTEREST INCOME

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM NONACCRUAL LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH NONACCRUAL LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR

ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS HAD THEY BEEN PERFORMING AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS

RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS

REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON

SUCH LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY

WAS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THIS DATA FOR THE YEARS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS

(FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. BASED ON RULES FROM THE

FFIEC, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE ALLOCATED TO A COUNTRY BASED ON THE

DOMICILE OF THE COUNTERPARTY. ADDITIONALLY, LOCAL FOREIGN OFFICE COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN

COMMITMENTS; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE EXCLUDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN

EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC

METHODOLOGIES ARE: THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES; NET LOCAL COUNTRY ASSETS ARE REDUCED

BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION); AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTERPARTY, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY

COLLATERAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES EMERGING MARKETS CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY EXPOSURE ON PAGES 128129.
