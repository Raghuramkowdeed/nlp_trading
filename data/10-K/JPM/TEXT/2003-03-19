ITEM 1: BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE

OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN

1968. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMORGAN

CHASE WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING

INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH

$759 BILLION IN ASSETS AND $42 BILLION IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2000, J.P. MORGAN & CO.

INCORPORATED (J.P. MORGAN) MERGED WITH

AND INTO THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION

(CHASE). UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER,

CHASE CHANGED ITS NAME TO J.P. MORGAN

CHASE & CO. THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS. AS A RESULT,

THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PROVIDED HEREIN

PRESENTS THE COMBINED RESULTS OF CHASE

AND J.P. MORGAN AS IF THE MERGER HAD BEEN

IN EFFECT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS

FOR THE PREDECESSOR INSTITUTIONS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRM WITH OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN

50 COUNTRIES. ITS PRINCIPAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK), A NEW YORK BANKING

CORPORATION HEADQUARTERED IN NEW YORK CITY,

AND CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA, NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION (CHASE USA), HEADQUARTERED IN DELAWARE. THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NONBANK

SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMSI).

THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL

AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND

SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND

AFFILIATED BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS

WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES

AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS

WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K,

QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT

REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO

THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED, PURSUANT

TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS

REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR

FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC).

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE INTERNALLY

ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING

PURPOSES, INTO FIVE MAJOR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (INVESTMENT BANK, TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

& PRIVATE BANKING, JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND

CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES). A DESCRIPTION

OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES ARE

DISCUSSED IN THE SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION

OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(MD&A) BEGINNING ON PAGE 24, AND IN NOTE

33 ON PAGE 108.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER

BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING

COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT

CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES,

AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING

COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER

INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES,

AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH THESE OTHER FIRMS

WITH RESPECT TO THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES OFFERED AND THE TYPES OF CLIENTS,

CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES

SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS

GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE

COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS,

THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE

PERFORMANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS, THE DEGREE TO

WHICH THE FEATURES OF ITS PRODUCTS APPEAL

TO CUSTOMERS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS ABLE TO MEET ITS CLIENTS

OBJECTIVES OR NEEDS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND

OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS

EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRIES HAVE MERGED, OF WHICH

THE MERGER OF CHASE AND J.P. MORGAN IS AN

EXAMPLE. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED

TO CONTINUE AND COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS

OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER CAPITAL

AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER

RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE

AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO COMPETE WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY BE LARGER,

OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR MAY HAVE A

STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN

GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM

IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND

FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED (THE

BHCA). IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) WAS ENACTED

WHICH ELIMINATED CERTAIN LEGAL BARRIERS

SEPARATING THE CONDUCT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, SUCH AS

COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING AND

INSURANCE. IN ADDITION, GLBA SUBSTANTIALLY

REVAMPED THE REGULATORY SCHEME WITHIN WHICH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS JPMORGAN

CHASE OPERATE.

UNDER GLBA, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MEETING

CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA MAY ELECT TO

BECOME FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, WHICH

MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

FINANCIAL IN NATURE, AS WELL AS IN

ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT THE BOARD OF

GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

(THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) AND THE

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

(U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT) DETERMINE ARE

FINANCIAL IN NATURE OR INCIDENTAL OR

COMPLEMENTARY TO FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES.

UNDER GLBA, FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES

SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE INSURANCE, SECURITIES

UNDERWRITING AND DEALING, MERCHANT BANKING,

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND LENDING ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13,

2000.

1

PART I

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, IF ANY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO BE

WELL-CAPITALIZED OR WELL-MANAGED (AS

DEFINED BELOW), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL OR MANAGERIAL

REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS

ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL

ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY

REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE

DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO

PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING

UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

(CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST

PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY

ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE

PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY MEET THE CAPITAL,

MANAGEMENT AND CRA REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER

ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA. HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER

GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL

REGULATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS

AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF

JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED

DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR

ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES (E.G.,

SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY

ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC, AND

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY STATE

INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS). THE FIRM MUST

CONTINUE TO FILE REPORTS AND OTHER

INFORMATION WITH, AND SUBMIT TO EXAMINATION

BY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS UMBRELLA

REGULATOR. HOWEVER, UNDER GLBA, WITH

RESPECT TO MATTERS AFFECTING FUNCTIONALLY

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD IS REQUIRED TO DEFER TO THE

APPLICABLE FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNLESS THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD CONCLUDES THAT THE

ACTIVITIES AT ISSUE POSE A RISK TO A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR BREACH A SPECIFIC

LAW THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS AUTHORITY

TO ENFORCE.

EFFECT OF GLBA ON BANK BROKER-DEALER AND

INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES.

TO PROMOTE

THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION

DESCRIBED ABOVE, GLBA PROVIDES FOR THE

AMENDMENT OF CERTAIN FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS TO ELIMINATE VARIOUS EXEMPTIONS

PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO BANKS. FOR EXAMPLE,

BANKS WILL NO LONGER BE GENERALLY EXEMPT

FROM THE BROKER-DEALER PROVISIONS OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. AS A

RESULT, JPMORGAN CHASES BANK SUBSIDIARIES

WILL EITHER NEED TO REGISTER WITH THE SEC

AS BROKER-DEALERS OR CEASE CONDUCTING MANY

ACTIVITIES DEEMED BROKER-DEALER ACTIVITIES.

GLBA DOES RETAIN A MORE LIMITED EXEMPTION

FROM BROKER-DEALER REGISTRATION FOR CERTAIN

BANKING PRODUCTS AND ACTIVITIES,

INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, MUNICIPAL AND

EXEMPTED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS; SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY ARRANGEMENTS; AND

TRUST, SECURITIZATION AND DERIVATIVES

PRODUCTS AND ACTIVITIES. THE INVESTMENT

ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 HAS ALSO BEEN AMENDED

TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN PROVISIONS EXEMPTING

BANKS FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF

THAT STATUTE, AND THE INVESTMENT COMPANY

ACT OF 1940 HAS BEEN AMENDED TO PROVIDE THE

SEC WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER VARIOUS

BANK MUTUAL FUND ACTIVITIES. THE PROVISIONS

DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH HAD AN ORIGINAL

EFFECTIVE DATE OF MAY 12, 2001. THE SEC HAS

DELAYED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

PROVISIONS DEALING WITH DEALER REGISTRATION

UNTIL SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THE PROVISIONS

DEALING WITH REGISTRATION AS A BROKER ARE

CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE EFFECTIVE MAY 12, 2003. HOWEVER, THE SEC HAS STATED THAT

IT INTENDS TO PROMULGATE PROPOSED

REGULATIONS PRIOR TO THAT DATE, AND THE

STAFF HAS INDICATED THAT THERE WILL BE

FURTHER EXTENSIONS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE TO

GIVE BANKS SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLY WITH

THE SECS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY

THE SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

THAT ARE CHARTERED BY A STATE AND ARE

MEMBER BANKS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

(A STATE MEMBER BANK) OR NATIONAL BANKS.

NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE

NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. THE

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A

STATE MEMBER BANK, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, OR BY A NATIONAL BANK, SUCH AS CHASE

USA, IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE

AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS

TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A

DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF

ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY

CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE

RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING

YEARS, UNLESS THE BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL

OF ITS APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATOR (WHICH, IN THE CASE OF A STATE

MEMBER BANK, IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

AND, IN THE CASE OF A NATIONAL BANK, IS THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

(THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY)). UNDER

THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY

NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS

UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS

ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK ARE IMPOSED BY NEW YORK LAW. SEE

NOTE 25 ON PAGE 99 FOR THE AMOUNT OF

DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT DECEMBER 31,

2002 AND 2001, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF

THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD, THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

(THE FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO

LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND

BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN

THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT

OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE

OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT

REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS

RATIOS MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED

BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER

LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE

CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING

GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES,

CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1

CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2

CAPITAL, SEE NOTE 26 ON PAGE 99. THE

AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED

THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL

CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND

TIER 2 CAPITAL.

2

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO

MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL

CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8%

AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK AND CERTAIN RISKS ARISING FROM

NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, AND THE

MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RISKS, AS IMPORTANT

FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING AN

INSTITUTIONS OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

OTHER FACTORS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY

FEDERAL REGULATORS INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURE; LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND MARKET

RISK; THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS;

THE QUALITY OF LOANS AND INVESTMENTS; THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF LOAN AND INVESTMENT

POLICIES; AND MANAGEMENTS OVERALL ABILITY

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL FINANCIAL AND

OPERATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS

PRESENTED BY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND

NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION,

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES INCORPORATE A

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

AND COMMODITY ACTIVITIES AND IN THE TRADING

OF DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS. THE MARKET RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RULES REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WITH

LARGE TRADING ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS JPMORGAN

CHASE) TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK

IN AN AMOUNT CALCULATED BY USING THE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OWN INTERNAL

VALUE-AT-RISK MODELS (SUBJECT TO PARAMETERS

SET BY THE REGULATORS).

THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AMENDED THEIR

REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2002, TO ADDRESS THE TREATMENT

OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS, RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS

AND DIRECT CREDIT SUBSTITUTES. THE

AMENDMENT DEFINES RESIDUAL INTERESTS AS

ON-BALANCE SHEET INTERESTS THAT ARE

RETAINED BY A SELLER AFTER A SECURITIZATION

OR OTHER TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

THAT EXPOSE THE SELLER TO A GREATER THAN

PRO RATA

SHARE OF THE CREDIT RISK IN SUCH

ASSETS. UNDER THE AMENDMENT, RISK-BASED

CAPITAL MUST BE HELD IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

SUCH RESIDUAL INTERESTS EVEN IF THAT AMOUNT

EXCEEDS THE FULL RISK-BASED CAPITAL CHARGE

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BE HELD

AGAINST THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED. THE

AMENDMENT ALSO IMPOSES A CONCENTRATION

LIMIT OF 25% OF TIER 1 CAPITAL ON

CREDIT-ENHANCING INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS (A

TYPE OF RESIDUAL INTEREST), REQUIRING ANY

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THAT LIMIT TO BE

DEDUCTED FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE AMENDMENT

ALSO TREATS RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS AND DIRECT

CREDIT SUBSTITUTES (SUCH AS LETTERS OF

CREDIT) MORE CONSISTENTLY FOR RISK-BASED

CAPITAL PURPOSES THAN PREVIOUSLY. THE

AMENDMENT INTRODUCES A MULTI-LEVEL APPROACH

TO ASSESSING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO

POSITIONS IN CERTAIN ASSET SECURITIZATIONS

BASED ON THE CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED TO

SUCH POSITION BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS (NRSROS).

FOR CERTAIN UNRATED POSITIONS OTHER THAN

RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE AMENDMENT PROVIDES

ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR ASSESSING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE LIMITED USE OF

A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INTERNAL RISK

RATING SYSTEM, AND, FOR POSITIONS ARISING

UNDER SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS COVERING

MULTIPLE PARTICIPANTS, RATINGS ASSIGNED TO

THE PROGRAM BY NRSROS.

THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE ALSO

ADOPTED, EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2002,

REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE INCREASED CAPITAL

CHARGES ON A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN

GENERAL, THE NEW RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO SUCH INVESTMENTS

REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL AUTHORITY UNDER

WHICH THEY ARE MADE. THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL

CHARGE INCREASES AS THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS CONCENTRATION IN SUCH

INVESTMENTS INCREASES. IF THE AGGREGATE

VALUE OF A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

NONFINANCIAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS LESS

THAN 15% OF ITS TIER 1 CAPITAL, THEN 8% OF

SUCH VALUE IS REQUIRED TO BE DEDUCTED FROM

THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TIER 1 CAPITAL.

IF THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF A BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS NONFINANCIAL EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IS MORE THAN 15% BUT LESS THAN

25% OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TIER 1

CAPITAL, THE DEDUCTION INCREASES TO

12% OF SUCH VALUE, AND IF SUCH AGGREGATE

VALUE IS MORE THAN 25% OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS TIER 1 CAPITAL, THE

DEDUCTION RISES TO 25%. THE NEW CHARGES DO

NOT APPLY TO INVESTMENTS MADE PRIOR TO

MARCH 13, 2000. EQUITY INVESTMENTS MADE

THROUGH SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES

IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO UP TO 15% OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TIER 1 CAPITAL ARE

EXEMPT FROM THE NEW CHARGES, BUT THE FULL

AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS STILL

INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING THE AGGREGATE

VALUE OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

NONFINANCIAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE

ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO

GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED

AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE TOTAL

ASSETS (NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS).

THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR STRONG

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (I.E., THOSE RATED

COMPOSITE 1 UNDER THE BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, PARENT

COMPANY, EARNINGS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY, OR

BOPEC, RATING SYSTEM) AND FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE

EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE

MINIMUM LEVELS DEPENDING UPON THEIR

PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND

GROWTH PLANS.

TIER 1 COMPONENTS: CAPITAL SURPLUS AND

COMMON STOCK REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT

FORMS OF CAPITAL AT JPMORGAN CHASE. BECAUSE

COMMON EQUITY HAS NO MATURITY DATE AND

BECAUSE DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ARE PAID

ONLY WHEN AND IF DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, COMMON EQUITY IS AVAILABLE TO

ABSORB LOSSES OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IS

SIMILAR TO COMMON STOCK IN ITS ABILITY TO

ABSORB LOSSES. IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DOES NOT DECLARE A DIVIDEND ON

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IN

ANY DIVIDEND PERIOD, THE HOLDERS OF THE

INSTRUMENT ARE NEVER ENTITLED TO RECEIVE

THAT DIVIDEND PAYMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES

OUTSTANDING NONCUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

IS A TYPE COMMONLY REFERENCED AS A FRAP.

A FIXED-RATE/ADJUSTABLE PREFERRED STOCK.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE ON FRAPS

MAY INCREASE (UP TO A PREDETERMINED

CEILING), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TREATS

THE FIRMS NONCUMULATIVE FRAPS IN A MANNER

SIMILAR TO CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD PERMITS CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL

BUT ONLY UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS, AS THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DO NOT PROVIDE AS

STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES AS COMMON

EQUITY AND NONCUMULATIVE, NON-FRAP

SECURITIES. CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK DOES NOT HAVE A MATURITY DATE,

SIMILAR TO OTHER FORMS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL.

HOWEVER, ANY DIVIDENDS NOT DECLARED ON

CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK ACCUMULATE AND

THUS CONTINUE TO BE DUE TO THE HOLDER OF

THE INSTRUMENT UNTIL ALL ARREARAGES ARE

SATISFIED. TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE A

TYPE OF SECURITY GENERALLY ISSUED BY A

SPECIAL-PURPOSE TRUST ESTABLISHED AND OWNED

BY JPMORGAN CHASE. PROCEEDS FROM THE

ISSUANCE TO THE PUBLIC OF THE TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITY ARE LENT TO THE FIRM FOR

AT LEAST 30 (BUT NOT MORE THAN 50) YEARS.

THE INTERCOMPANY NOTE

3

PART I

THAT EVIDENCES THIS LOAN PROVIDES THAT THE

INTEREST PAYMENTS BY JPMORGAN CHASE ON THE

NOTE MAY BE DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS.

DURING THE PERIOD OF ANY SUCH DEFERRAL, NO

PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS MAY BE MADE ON ANY

OUTSTANDING JPMORGAN CHASE PREFERRED OR

COMMON STOCK OR ON THE OUTSTANDING TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED TO THE PUBLIC.

TIER 2 COMPONENTS: LONG-TERM SUBORDINATED

DEBT (GENERALLY HAVING AN ORIGINAL MATURITY

OF 10-12 YEARS) IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF

JPMORGAN CHASES TIER 2 CAPITAL.

SUBORDINATED DEBT IS DEEMED A FORM OF

REGULATORY CAPITAL BECAUSE PAYMENTS ON THE

DEBT ARE SUBORDINATED TO OTHER CREDITORS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE, INCLUDING HOLDERS OF SENIOR

AND MEDIUM LONG-TERM DEBT AND

COUNTERPARTIES ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

UNDER GLBA, ALL FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES FOR

PURPOSES OF THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE. HOWEVER, GLBA

SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD FROM IMPOSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES

ON CERTAIN FUNCTIONALLY REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES (SUCH AS BROKER-DEALERS AND

INSURANCE COMPANIES) THAT ARE IN

COMPLIANCE WITH

THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF

THEIR FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES

FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL

COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. THE BASEL

COMMITTEE, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF BANK

SUPERVISORS AND CENTRAL BANKS FROM THE

GROUP OF TEN COUNTRIES, ISSUED ITS CAPITAL

ACCORD IN 1988 TO ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE IN

THE CAPITAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED A

PROPOSED REPLACEMENT FOR THE CAPITAL ACCORD

IN JANUARY, 2001 AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, ISSUED A NUMBER OF WORKING PAPERS

SUPPLEMENTING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THAT

REPLACEMENT (THE NEW ACCORD). BASED ON

THESE DOCUMENTS, THE NEW ACCORD WOULD ADOPT

A THREE-PILLAR FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING

CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THESE PILLARS WOULD

INCLUDE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MORE

EMPHASIS ON SUPERVISORY ASSESSMENT OF

CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND GREATER RELIANCE ON

MARKET DISCIPLINE. UNDER THE NEW ACCORD,

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE MORE

DIFFERENTIATED BASED UPON PERCEIVED

DISTINCTIONS IN CREDITWORTHINESS. SUCH

REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE BASED EITHER ON

RATINGS ASSIGNED BY RATING AGENCIES OR, IN

THE CASE OF A BANKING ORGANIZATION THAT MET

CERTAIN SUPERVISORY STANDARDS, ON THE

ORGANIZATIONS INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS. THE

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEW

ACCORD WOULD ALSO INCORPORATE A CAPITAL

CHARGE FOR OPERATIONAL RISK. AT PRESENT,

THE TARGET DATE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE NEW

ACCORD IS THE END OF 2006.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991

(FDICIA) REVISED CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT, AS WELL

AS CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL BANKING STATUTES.

IN GENERAL, FDICIA PROVIDES FOR EXPANDED

REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND

THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING

COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT

MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

PURSUANT TO FDICIA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD, THE FDIC AND THE COMPTROLLER OF THE

CURRENCY ADOPTED REGULATIONS SETTING FORTH

A FIVE-TIER SCHEME FOR MEASURING THE

CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS THEY SUPERVISE. UNDER THE

REGULATIONS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES), AN

INSTITUTION WOULD BE PLACED IN ONE OF THE

FOLLOWING FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES WHEN

THESE RATIOS FALL WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED

RANGES.

INDICATED BASED ON OTHER SUPERVISORY

CRITERIA.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES GENERALLY

WILL DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS

CLASSIFICATION WITHIN THE FIVE CAPITAL

CATEGORIES. THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE; HOWEVER, SUBJECT

TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED

PURSUANT

TO GLBA, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE

APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY

LEVEL BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS

OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY

BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES

RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING

INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

SUBSIDIARY AND MAY BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL

MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS

COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, EACH OF

JPMORGAN CHASES BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

WAS WELL-CAPITALIZED.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

FDICIA ALSO

REQUIRED THE FDIC TO ESTABLISH A

RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR FDIC

DEPOSIT INSURANCE. UNDER THE FDICS

RISK-BASED INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENT

SYSTEM, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

ASSIGNED TO ONE OF NINE RISK

CLASSIFICATIONS BASED UPON CERTAIN CAPITAL

AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES AND, DEPENDING

UPON ITS CLASSIFICATION, IS ASSESSED

INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON ITS DEPOSITS.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS INSURED BY THE

BANK INSURANCE FUND ARE REQUIRED TO PAY

PREMIUMS RANGING FROM 0 BASIS POINTS TO 27

BASIS POINTS OF U.S. DEPOSITS. EACH OF

JPMORGAN CHASES BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, CURRENTLY

QUALIFIES FOR THE 0 BASIS POINT

ASSESSMENT. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN

INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT, IF ENACTED,

WOULD GIVE THE FDIC DISCRETION TO IMPOSE

DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON ALL

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, IF

THE RATIO OF INSURED DEPOSITS TO MONEY IN

THE BANK INSURANCE FUND DROPS BELOW

SPECIFIED LEVELS, THE FDIC WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO IMPOSE PREMIUMS ON ALL BANKS

INSURED BY THE BANK INSURANCE FUND. ALL

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST ALSO PAY AN

ANNUAL ASSESSMENT SO THAT THE FINANCING

CORPORATION (FICO) MAY PAY INTEREST ON

BONDS IT ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE

RESOLUTION OF SAVINGS ASSOCIATION

INSOLVENCIES OCCURRING PRIOR TO 1991. THE

FICO ASSESSMENT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2003 IS 1.68 BASIS POINTS

4

OF U.S.

DEPOSITS. THE RATE SCHEDULES ARE SUBJECT

TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS BY THE FDIC. IN

ADDITION, THE FDIC HAS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE

SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED

IN THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS ACT.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN

FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE

HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN

CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED

INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH

INSTITUTION BEING IN DEFAULT OR IN

DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS

CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). DEFAULT IS

GENERALLY DEFINED AS THE APPOINTMENT OF A

CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER AND IN DANGER OF

DEFAULT IS DEFINED AS CERTAIN CONDITIONS

INDICATING THAT A DEFAULT IS LIKELY TO

OCCUR ABSENT REGULATORY ASSISTANCE. AN FDIC

CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT

OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY

AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR

RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN

CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE

POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE

APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT

TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR

DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE

PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE

FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMANCE

OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY

THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE

PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO

OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE OF

JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS

UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY

THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW

AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC

MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER

OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE CLAIMS OF

HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES

(INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE

DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS

OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE

INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS,

IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER

RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT,

WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO

REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC

NOTEHOLDERS OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM

THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION,

SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK OR CHASE USA,

THE PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED

DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF

ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE

DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT.

FOLLOWING THE

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND

WASHINGTON, D.C., THE UNITED STATES

GOVERNMENT ACTED IN SEVERAL WAYS TO

TIGHTEN CONTROL ON ACTIVITIES PERCEIVED TO

BE CONNECTED TO MONEY LAUNDERING AND

TERRORIST FUNDING. BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER

23, 2001, PRESIDENT BUSH ISSUED A SERIES

OF ORDERS WHICH IDENTIFY TERRORISTS AND

TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND REQUIRE THE

BLOCKING OF PROPERTY AND ASSETS OF, AS

WELL AS PROHIBITING ALL TRANSACTIONS OR

DEALING WITH, SUCH TERRORISTS, TERRORIST

ORGANIZATIONS AND THOSE THAT ASSIST OR

SPONSOR THEM. ON OCTOBER 26, 2001,

PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED INTO LAW THE USA

PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE ACT).

THE ACT SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENS EXISTING

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE

EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE

UNITED STATES, IMPOSES NEW COMPLIANCE AND

DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS, CREATES NEW

CRIMES AND PENALTIES, COMPELS THE

PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS LOCATED BOTH

INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING THOSE OF NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS

THAT HAVE A CORRESPONDENT RELATIONSHIP IN

THE UNITED STATES, AND CLARIFIES THE SAFE

HARBOR FROM CIVIL LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS.

THE ACT MANDATES THE U.S. TREASURY

DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE A NUMBER OF

REGULATIONS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE ACTS

REQUIREMENTS OR PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC

GUIDANCE ON THEIR APPLICATION.

THE ACT REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, AS DEFINED, TO ESTABLISH

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE

DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. SUCH PROGRAMS MUST

INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADEQUATE

POLICIES, THE DESIGNATION OF A COMPLIANCE

OFFICER, EMPLOYEE TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND AN

INDEPENDENT AUDIT FUNCTION TO REVIEW AND

TEST THE PROGRAM. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS HAD IN

PLACE, PURSUANT TO PREVIOUSLY EXISTING LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, A KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER

POLICY AND AN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES, AS

APPROPRIATE BASED ON A RISK-BASED ANALYSIS,

PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO

ESTABLISHING THE IDENTITY AND ADDRESS OF

THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF AN ACCOUNT, THE

SOURCE OF THE ACCOUNTS FUNDS AND THE

PROPOSED USE OF THE ACCOUNT, AS WELL AS

REQUIRING THE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING

OF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS TO APPROPRIATE

LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE

BELIEVES ITS PROGRAMS SATISFY THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT.

THE ACT REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

THAT MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS FOR

NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS OR PERSONS OR THAT

ARE INVOLVED IN PRIVATE BANKING FOR

NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR THEIR

REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE,

SPECIFIC AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE

DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND

CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED

TO DETECT AND REPORT INSTANCES OF MONEY

LAUNDERING THROUGH THOSE ACCOUNTS. IN

FURTHERANCE OF THESE PROVISIONS, THE ACT

MANDATES SPECIFIC MINIMUM STANDARDS

REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRIVATE

BANKING ACCOUNTS AND PROHIBITS FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS FROM ESTABLISHING,

MAINTAINING, ADMINISTERING OR MANAGING

CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS WITH ANY NON-U.S.

BANK THAT DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

IN ANY JURISDICTION UNLESS THE SO-CALLED

SHELL BANK IS AFFILIATED WITH A REGULATED

PHYSICALLY-ESTABLISHED BANK. JPMORGAN CHASE

WILL CONTINUE TO REVISE AND UPDATE ITS

KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICY AND ITS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS TO REFLECT

CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE ACT, AND THE U.S.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS TO BE

ISSUED THEREUNDER, IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ITS PROVISIONS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER

CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY,

JPMORGAN CHASE IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A

SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK

SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO

ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA

PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY

VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING

PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY

TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE

FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS

TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE

THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING

RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

5

PART I

ANY LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY

OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN

OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANKS.

IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS

BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATORY AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL

OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK AT A CERTAIN LEVEL

WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE

AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY

FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND

CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM

AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES AND ON

INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE

RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND

OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK

SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN

SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

THE FIRMS BANK AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (MANY OF

WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL

REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK AS A NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND

A STATE MEMBER BANK, IS SUBJECT TO

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE NEW YORK

STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC.

JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS CHASE USA, ARE

SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. SUPERVISION

AND REGULATION BY EACH OF THE FOREGOING

REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERALLY INCLUDE

COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR

ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND

CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF

PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND

LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS SECURITIES

UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE

ACTIVITIES THROUGH JPMSI AND OTHER

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH

ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC

AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES

DEALERS, INC. JPMSI IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW

YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. THE OPERATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC. THE TYPES

OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT

TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF

THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND

CHASE USA AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL

LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, THE

EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, THE FAIR CREDIT

REPORTING, THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION

PRACTICE AND THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER

ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE

STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING,

ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION OF CONSUMER

LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT

NEED TO BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

LOANS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED

BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO

DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE

FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT

TO (1) THE SHARING OF NON-PUBLIC CUSTOMER

INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES

AND OTHERS AND (2) THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND

SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA,

RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE

OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION

SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NON-AFFILIATES,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN

GLBA.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FIRM HAS MADE AND

WILL MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE

STATEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT

THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO

HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OFTEN USE WORDS

SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, TARGET, EXPECT,

ESTIMATE, INTEND, PLAN, GOAL,

BELIEVE OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR

MEANING. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS GIVE

JPMORGAN CHASES CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR

FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES

OR RESULTS. JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURE IN

THIS REPORT, INCLUDING IN THE MD&A SECTION,

CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE

FIRM ALSO MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS IN ITS OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED

WITH THE SEC AND IN OTHER WRITTEN

MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS SENIOR

MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS ORALLY TO ANALYSTS, INVESTORS,

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MEDIA AND OTHERS.

ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR

ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE

DATE THEY ARE MADE. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES

NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF

CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT ARISE AFTER

THE DATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WAS

MADE. THE READER SHOULD, HOWEVER, CONSULT

ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES OF A

FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE JPMORGAN CHASE MAY

MAKE IN ITS ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K,

ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ITS

CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, BY THEIR

NATURE, ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. THE FIRMS ACTUAL FUTURE

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE

SET FORTH IN JPMORGAN CHASES

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT

MIGHT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO VARY FROM THAT

DESCRIBED IN ITS FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE CREDIT, MARKET,

OPERATIONAL, LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND

OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN THE MD&A SECTION

OF THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER

PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC. IN

ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS

FORTH CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT

THE FIRM BELIEVES COULD CAUSE ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

EXPECTED RESULTS. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS

BESIDES THOSE LISTED BELOW OR DISCUSSED IN

JPMORGAN CHASES REPORTS TO THE SEC ALSO

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS,

AND THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY

SUCH LIST OF FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET

OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED AS PERMITTED

BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION

REFORM ACT OF 1995.

BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMY.

THE PROFITABILITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A

WORSENING OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD. THE DIFFICULT

GLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT

EXISTED IN 2001 CONTINUED IN 2002 AND THIS

CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT COULD PERSIST FOR

SOME PERIOD OF TIME IN 2003. UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN

EXACERBATED BY INVESTOR CONCERNS OVER THE

INTEGRITY OF THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING TERRORISTS THREATS

AND THE POSSIBLE OUTBREAK OF WAR. FACTORS

SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY

OF EQUITY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES,

INVESTOR SENTIMENT, INFLATION, AND THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF

CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND

TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS EFFECTED BY THE

FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY

6

BUSINESSES, AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE

REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM JPMORGAN

CHASES PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A FURTHER

MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A

DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS

AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE

REVENUES IT RECEIVES FROM TRADING

COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. HIGHER INTEREST

RATES OR CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET

ALSO COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF

FINANCIAL INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN

SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM GENERALLY

MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE

FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND

EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT

BANKING INVESTMENTS AT JPMORGAN PARTNERS.

THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET

VALUES OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS ARE

AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT STANDING; ITS

SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING;

VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND IN EQUITY

AND DEBT MARKETS; AND THE ECONOMIC,

POLITICAL AND BUSINESS FACTORS DESCRIBED

BELOW. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT

THESE REVENUES WILL EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY

FROM TIME TO TIME. CONTINUED MARKET

WEAKNESS OR WORSENING OF THE ECONOMY COULD

CAUSE THE FIRM TO INCUR MARK-TO-MARKET

LOSSES IN THE VALUES OF THESE POSITIONS.

A MARKET DOWNTURN ALSO COULD RESULT IN A

DECLINE IN THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS

FOR MANAGING ASSETS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER

LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR

A DOWNTURN IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT

THE FLOWS OF MONEYS TO OR FROM THE MUTUAL

FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM. MOREOVER, EVEN

IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN,

BELOW-MARKET PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN

CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS COULD RESULT IN A

DECLINE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND,

THEREFORE, IN THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES.

AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN

CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ASSETS BY INCREASING THE RISK THAT A

GREATER NUMBER OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS

WOULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR

OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

FURTHER, A CONTINUING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER RATE OF

DELINQUENCIES BY

CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES WHICH, IN TURN,

WOULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF

CHARGE-OFFS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, ALL OF WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS. THE

FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY

AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST RATES, THE RATE OF

UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE, CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING,

AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AS

THESE FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF

CONSUMER LOANS AND CREDIT QUALITY.

COMPETITION.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS

VARIOUS FACTORS TO CAUSE COMPETITIVE

CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY. FOR

EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE

GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE

FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY

WERE BANKING PRODUCTS AND FOR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS TO COMPETE WITH TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES IN PROVIDING ELECTRONIC AND

INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM EXPECTS CROSS-INDUSTRY

COMPETITION TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY,

PARTICULARLY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES

LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT

ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND AT

MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS; TRADING IN NON-U.S.

SECURITIES.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN

DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD COMMONLY

KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF

LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL AND

DIPLOMATIC DEVELOPMENTS, CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES

IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF

CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND

CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO NON-U.S.

OWNERSHIP. JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO INVESTS IN

THE SECURITIES OF CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING EMERGING

MARKETS. REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF

NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO

NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE

ABOVE FACTORS. THE IMPACT OF THESE

FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED BECAUSE,

GENERALLY, NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES,

ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE

THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASE, LIKE ALL

LARGE CORPORATIONS, IS EXPOSED TO MANY

TYPES OF OPERATIONAL RISK, INCLUDING THE

RISK OF FRAUD BY EMPLOYEES OR OUTSIDERS,

UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS BY EMPLOYEES OR

OPERATIONAL ERRORS, INCLUDING CLERICAL OR

RECORD-KEEPING ERRORS OR ERRORS RESULTING

FROM FAULTY OR DISABLED COMPUTER OR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE HIGH

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS AT JPMORGAN CHASE,

CERTAIN ERRORS MAY BE REPEATED OR

COMPOUNDED BEFORE THEY ARE DISCOVERED AND

SUCCESSFULLY RECTIFIED. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRMS NECESSARY DEPENDENCE UPON AUTOMATED

SYSTEMS TO RECORD AND PROCESS ITS

TRANSACTION VOLUME MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE

RISK THAT TECHNICAL SYSTEM FLAWS OR

EMPLOYEE TAMPERING OR MANIPULATION OF THOSE

SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN LOSSES THAT ARE

DIFFICULT TO DETECT. THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE

SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING

SYSTEMS, ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE

WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL

(INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES

OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

OUTAGES), WHICH MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN

SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO LOSS OR

LIABILITY TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM IS FURTHER

EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT ITS EXTERNAL

VENDORS MAY BE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO THE FIRM (OR WILL

BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK OF FRAUD OR

OPERATIONAL ERRORS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE

EMPLOYEES AS IS THE FIRM), AND TO THE RISK

THAT ITS (OR ITS VENDORS) BUSINESS

CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE

NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADEQUATE. ALTHOUGH

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

CONTROLS DESIGNED TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK

AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, THE FIRM HAS IN THE

PAST SUFFERED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONAL RISK,

AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN

CHASE WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES FROM

OPERATIONAL RISKS IN THE FUTURE.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS

ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES

AND EARNINGS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE

FISCAL OR OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED

BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE

U.S., NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND

INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY

COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING

DEPOSITS AND ALSO MAY IMPACT THE VALUE OF

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM.

THESE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE

COST TO JPMORGAN CHASE OF FUNDS FOR

LENDING AND INVESTING. THE NATURE AND

IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS AND FISCAL POLICIES ARE

NOT PREDICTABLE AND ARE BEYOND JPMORGAN

CHASES CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THESE

POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN IMPACT THE

FIRMS CUS-

7

PART I

TOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND

ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT

SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT

ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

REPUTATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK.

THE FIRMS

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS AND

EMPLOYEES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO

THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED. THE

FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR TO APPEAR

TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT

COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD

CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS

PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE

NOT LIMITED TO, APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ETHICAL ISSUES,

MONEY-LAUNDERING, PRIVACY, RECORD-KEEPING,

SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES AND THE PROPER

IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL,

CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS INHERENT

IN ITS PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO ADDRESS

APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD ALSO GIVE

RISE TO ADDITIONAL LEGAL RISK TO THE FIRM,

WHICH COULD, IN TURN, INCREASE THE SIZE AND

NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND DAMAGES ASSERTED

AGAINST THE FIRM OR SUBJECT THE FIRM TO

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES.

CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASES REVENUES ALSO

ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTENT TO WHICH

MANAGEMENT CAN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE ITS

BUSINESS STRATEGIES WITHIN A DISCIPLINED

RISK ENVIRONMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY

TO GROW ITS BUSINESSES IS AFFECTED BY

PRICING AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, AS WELL

AS BY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND THE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE ABILITY OF

MANAGEMENT TO UTILIZE THE SHAREHOLDER

VALUE ADDED METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO

MAINTAIN EXPENSE DISCIPLINE WILL BE

IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT

TO WHICH THE FIRM ACHIEVES ITS FINANCIAL

TARGETS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT ANY OF

THE INSTRUMENTS AND STRATEGIES JPMORGAN

CHASE USES TO HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO MARKET, CREDIT AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, THE FIRM MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO MITIGATE EFFECTIVELY ITS

RISK EXPOSURES IN PARTICULAR MARKET

ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST PARTICULAR TYPES OF

RISK. JPMORGAN CHASES BALANCE SHEET GROWTH

WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS ON ITS

DETERMINATION TO SECURITIZE, SELL, PURCHASE

OR SYNDICATE PARTICULAR LOANS OR LOAN

PORTFOLIOS. JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING

REVENUES AND INTEREST RATE RISK ARE

DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PROPERLY, AND MARK-TO-MARKET, CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES OR

RATES. THE FIRMS EARNINGS WILL ALSO BE

DEPENDENT UPON HOW EFFECTIVELY IT

DETERMINES AND ASSESSES THE COST OF CREDIT,

AND MANAGES RISK CONCENTRATIONS, INCLUDING

EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR INDUSTRY AND

SINGLE-NAME OBLIGORS. TO THE EXTENT ITS

ASSESSMENT OF MIGRATIONS IN CREDIT QUALITY,

RISK CONCENTRATIONS, OR ASSUMPTIONS OR

ESTIMATES USED IN ESTABLISHING ITS LOAN

LOSS RESERVES PROVE INACCURATE OR NOT

PREDICTIVE OF ACTUAL RESULTS, THE FIRM

COULD SUFFER HIGHER-THAN-ANTICIPATED CREDIT

LOSSES. THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF

CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

IN MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK, AS

EVALUATION BY RATING AGENCIES OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS AFFECTS THEIR

DETERMINATIONS AS TO THE FIRMS CREDIT

RATINGS AND, THEREFORE, ITS COST OF FUNDS.

THESE ACTIONS ARE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS,

INCLUDING STATE PENSION FUNDS, WHO

PURCHASED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY

KNEW OR WERE RECKLESS OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT

KNOWING THAT THE SECURITIES WERE SOLD TO

PLAINTIFFS ON THE BASIS OF

MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS OF

MATERIAL FACTS CONCERNING THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF WORLDCOM. THE COMPLAINTS

AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND JPMSI ASSERT

CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES

LAWS, ERISA, OTHER STATE STATUTES AND UNDER

COMMON LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD AND NEGLIGENT

MISREPRESENTATION.

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LITIGATION.

JPMSI (FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE SECURITIES,

INC.) HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR

THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANT IN 14 ACTIONS THAT

WERE FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN

DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA OR FILED IN OKLAHOMA

STATE COURT BEGINNING IN OCTOBER 1999

ARISING OUT OF THE FAILURE OF COMMERCIAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (CFSI).

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS ARE

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS EITHER

KNEW OR WERE RECKLESS IN NOT KNOWING THAT

THE SECURITIES WERE SOLD TO PLAINTIFFS ON

THE BASIS OF MISLEADING MISREPRESENTATIONS

AND OMISSIONS OF MATERIAL FACTS. THE

COMPLAINTS AGAINST JPMSI ASSERT CLAIMS

THE OKLAHOMA SECURITIES ACT, AND UNDER

COMMON LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD AND NEGLIGENT

MISREPRESENTATION. IN THE ACTIONS AGAINST

JPMSI, DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION ALLEGEDLY

BEGINNING IN MAY

SECURITIES SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED,

ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS IN THE

SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS IN A

LARGE NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK. THESE SUITS PURPORT TO CHALLENGE

ALLEGED IMPROPRIETIES IN THE ALLOCATION OF

STOCK IN VARIOUS PUBLIC OFFERINGS,

INCLUDING SOME OFFERINGS FOR WHICH A

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY SERVED AS AN

UNDERWRITER. THE SUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF

SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST LAWS ARISING FROM

ALLEGED MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND

OMISSIONS IN REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND

PROSPECTUSES FOR THE INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS AND WITH RESPECT TO AFTERMARKET

TRANSACTIONS IN THE OFFERED SECURITIES. THE

SECURITIES CLAIMS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, MISREPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING

COMMISSIONS PAID TO JPMORGAN CHASE AND

AFTERMARKET TRANSACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS WHO

RECEIVED ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN THE

RESPECTIVE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. THE

ANTITRUST CLAIMS ALLEGE AN ILLEGAL

CONSPIRACY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS, IN

EXCHANGE FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

ALLOCATIONS, TO PAY UNDISCLOSED AND

EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS AND TO MAKE

AFTER-MARKET PURCHASES OF THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING SECURITIES AT A PRICE

HIGHER THAN THE OFFERING PRICE AS A

PRECONDITION TO RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS. ON

FEBRUARY 13, 2003, THE COURT DENIED THE

MOTIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHERS TO

DISMISS THE SECURITIES COMPLAINTS. JPMORGAN

CHASE ALSO HAS RECEIVED VARIOUS SUBPOENAS

AND INFORMAL REQUESTS FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND

OTHER AGENCIES SEEKING INFORMATION RELATING

TO INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING ALLOCATION

PRACTICES. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2003, THE

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS

(NASD) CENSURED JPMSI AND FINED IT $6

MILLION FOR ACTIVITIES IT FOUND TO

CONSTITUTE UNLAWFUL PROFIT SHARING BY

HAMBRECHT & QUIST GROUP PRIOR TO ITS

ACQUISITION IN 2000. IN AGREEING TO THE

RESOLUTION OF THE CHARGES, JPMSI NEITHER

ADMITTED NOR DENIED THE NASDS CONTENTIONS.

JPMSI HAS BEEN ADVISED BY THE SEC THAT IT

IS ALSO CONSIDERING BRINGING A DISCIPLINARY

ACTION AGAINST JPMSI. JPMSI HAS SUBMITTED

TO THE STAFF OF THE SEC A LETTER OUTLINING

THE BASIS FOR JPMSIS POSITION THAT NO SUCH

ACTION IS WARRANTED AND IS CURRENTLY IN

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SEC.

RESEARCH ANALYSTS CONFLICTS.

ON DECEMBER

20, 2002, THE FIRM REACHED AN AGREEMENT IN

PRINCIPLE WITH THE SEC, THE NASD, THE NEW

YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, THE NEW YORK STATE

ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE, AND THE NORTH AMERICAN

SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION, ON

BEHALF OF STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS, TO

RESOLVE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE RELATING TO RESEARCH ANALYST

INDEPENDENCE. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT IN

PRINCIPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL AGREE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS (I) TO PAY $50 MILLION

FOR RETROSPECTIVE RELIEF, (II) TO ADOPT

INTERNAL STRUCTURAL AND OPERATIONAL

REFORMS THAT WILL FURTHER AUGMENT THE

STEPS IT HAS ALREADY TAKEN TO ENSURE THE

INTEGRITY OF JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYST

RESEARCH, (III) TO CONTRIBUTE $25 MILLION

SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS TO PROVIDE

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH TO

CLIENTS, AND (IV) TO CONTRIBUTE $5 MILLION

TOWARDS INVESTOR EDUCATION. THE SETTLEMENT

IS SUBJECT TO FINALIZATION OF MUTUALLY

SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS AND MUST

BE APPROVED BY THE SEC AND STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

LITIGATION RESERVE AND OTHER.

DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE FIRM

ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $900 MILLION

RELATED TO COSTS ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED

IN CONNECTION WITH THE VARIOUS PRIVATE

LITIGATIONS AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES

INVOLVING ENRON AND THE OTHER MATERIAL

LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THIS

RESERVE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS BEST

ESTIMATE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL,

OF THE CURRENT PROBABLE AGGREGATE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MATTERS. OF THE $900

MILLION, $600 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO

THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ENRON. THE

BALANCE OF $300 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED

TO THE VARIOUS LITIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS DEBT

AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES AND

EQUITY RESEARCH PRACTICES, AND INCLUDES THE

$80 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN DECEMBER 2002

RELATING TO EQUITY RESEARCH PRACTICES. IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RESERVE COULD BE

SUBJECT TO REVISION IN THE FUTURE.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES,

PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS FOR WHICH

THE RESERVE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE

BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN

VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK

VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR

WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL

THEORIES OR INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

PARTIES, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH

CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE

PENDING MATTERS (INCLUDING THE PENDING

MATTERS AS TO WHICH THE RESERVE HAS BEEN

ESTABLISHED) WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF

THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL

BE, OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS RELATED TO

EACH PENDING MATTER WILL BE. SUBJECT TO THE

FOREGOING CAVEAT, JPMORGAN CHASE

ANTICIPATES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL

AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED $900

MILLION RESERVE, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE

LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT

SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

THE FIRM, ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR PROCEEDING OR THE IMPOSITION OF

A PARTICULAR FINE OR PENALTY MAY BE

MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING

RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD DEPENDING

UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE

LOSS OR LIABILITY AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN

CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE &CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) REPORTED 2002 NET

INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION, OR $0.80 PER SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $1.7

BILLION, OR $0.80 PER SHARE, IN 2001. THE RESULTS FOR THE YEAR WERE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY SLUGGISH CAPITAL MARKETS, BY CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES IN CERTAIN

SEGMENTS OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIOS, BY

LARGE CHARGES RELATED TO LITIGATION AND BY CONTINUING INTEGRATION EXPENSES

RESULTING FROM THE MERGER OF J.P. MORGAN AND CHASE. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THE

CONSUMER BUSINESSES REPORTED RECORD RESULTS, AND TREASURY & SECURITIES

SERVICES (T&SS) HAD A SOLID YEAR, HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF THE FIRMS

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS MODEL.

AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS BALANCE OF BUSINESSES, 2002 TOTAL REPORTED REVENUES

OF $29.6 BILLION WERE UP 1% FROM 2001. THE NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESSES

AT CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES (CFS) BENEFITED FROM THE LOW-INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT, WITH THE MORTGAGE COMPANY, IN PARTICULAR, HAVING AN EXCEPTIONAL

YEAR. T&SS REPORTED MODEST REVENUE GROWTH, AS STRONG GAINS IN TREASURY

SERVICES AND INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES OFFSET A DECLINE IN INVESTOR

SERVICES. AT THE INVESTMENT BANK (IB), THE SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED ECONOMIC

RECOVERY AND DIMINISHED INVESTOR CONFIDENCE LED TO CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN

CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, WHICH WAS REFLECTED IN LOWER TRADING REVENUE AND

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING (IMPB)

REVENUES DECLINED AS A RESULT OF LOWER GLOBAL EQUITY VALUATIONS AND REDUCED

INVESTOR ACTIVITY; ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION DECLINED PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET

DEPRECIATION AND INSTITUTIONAL OUTFLOWS. DETERIORATION IN EQUITY MARKETS

ADVERSELY AFFECTED JPMORGAN PARTNERS (JPMP); WRITE-OFFS AND WRITE-DOWNS OF

PRIVATE HOLDINGS AND NET MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON PUBLIC SECURITIES WERE NOT

OFFSET BY CASH GAINS, AS FINANCING AND EXIT OPPORTUNITIES REMAINED

CONSTRAINED.

THE FIRMS TOTAL REPORTED NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECLINED 4% FROM 2001 AND

INCLUDED SEVERAL LARGE CHARGES IN BOTH YEARS. IN 2002, THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES WERE $1.2 BILLION, VERSUS $2.5

BILLION THE PREVIOUS YEAR. ALSO IN 2002, THE FIRM RECORDED A $1.3 BILLION

CHARGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF ITS ENRON-RELATED SURETY

LITIGATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESERVE RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL

LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND RECORDED A $0.1 BILLION CHARGE

RELATED TO EXCESS REAL ESTATE. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE CHARGES IN BOTH

YEARS, THE FIRMS FULL-YEAR 2002 NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $20.2 BILLION WAS

LOWER THAN THAT OF 2001.

IN ADDITION, IN 2002, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED SEVERAL PROGRAMS AIMING TO ALIGN

EXPENSE LEVELS WITH LOWER REVENUE PROSPECTS. SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS FROM

THESE INITIATIVES ADDED $890 MILLION TO NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR,

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF WHICH WERE IN IB. DESPITE THOSE COSTS, ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS REPORTED LOWER-TO-FLAT NONINTEREST EXPENSES, EXCEPT CFS, WHERE HIGHER

BUSINESS VOLUMES DROVE EXPENSE GROWTH. IB REDUCED HEADCOUNT IN LINE WITH LOWER

MARKET ACTIVITY LEVELS. IMPB HAS REDUCED ITS EXPENSE RUN-RATE BY MORE THAN HALF

A BILLION DOLLARS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2001. IN T&SS, TIGHT EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT ALLOWED FOR INVESTMENTS WHILE KEEPING EXPENSE LEVELS FLAT WITH 2001

LEVELS. THE FIRMS EXPENSES WERE FURTHER REDUCED BY THE ADOPTION IN 2002 OF

SFAS 142, WHICH ELIMINATED THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED 36% FROM 2001. THIS WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO TROUBLED COMMERCIAL CREDITS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

CABLE SECTORS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT LOOKS AT

RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS TO ASSESS THE OVERALL FIRM AND EACH OF ITS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND TO FACILITATE AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE EARNINGS FOR THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ABSENT UNUSUAL EVENTS. JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING EARNINGS,

WHICH EXCLUDE MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS, WERE $3.4

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN 2001. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND A

RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE FIRMS REPORTED AND OPERATING RESULTS, SEE PAGES 22

AND 23.

RISK MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS CENTRAL

TO THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

TOTAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS ROSE TO $4.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN

INCREASE OF 22% FROM YEAR-END 2001, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT AND

RAPID DETERIORATION IN CREDIT QUALITY IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CABLE AND

MERCHANT ENERGY SECTORS. THE FIRM ESTABLISHED A MORE STRINGENT EXPOSURE REVIEW

PROCESS AND LOWER ABSOLUTE EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR INDUSTRY AND SINGLE-NAME

CONCENTRATIONS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT-GRADE OBLIGORS.

17

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK PARAMETERS ACROSS THE FIRM REMAINED STABLE, AND TRADING RESULTS

WERE WITHIN VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) LIMITS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

THE FIRM CONTINUED TO DEVELOP ITS SELF-ASSESSMENT, OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT

MONITORING AND INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES TO ENHANCE ITS OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE.

THE FIRM CREATED A POLICY REVIEW OFFICE TO ENHANCE THE PROCEDURES IT USES TO

EXAMINE TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL ISSUES

AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE HAS INTENSIFIED THE SCRUTINY

OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE GOAL

THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO DECEIVE INVESTORS OR OTHERS.

FINALLY, THE FIRM REVIEWED THE LEVEL OF PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IN ITS PORTFOLIO

AND HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE, OVER TIME, THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN

PRIVATE EQUITY TO APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY,

FROM APPROXIMATELY 20% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FIRMS TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8.2%, COMPARED WITH

8.3% AT YEAR-END 2001. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED

ITS INTENTION TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.34 PER SHARE

ON THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, PROVIDED THAT CAPITAL RATIOS REMAIN STRONG AND

EARNINGS PROSPECTS EXCEED THE CURRENT DIVIDEND.

SOUND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT REMAINS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MAINTAINING THE

FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS. LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED TO

FUND BOTH ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS. IT SEEKS TO

ENSURE THAT THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS WILL BE MET EVEN IF ACCESS TO FUNDING IS

TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. ALTHOUGH THE FIRMS DEBT RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED ONE

NOTCH THIS YEAR TO AA-/AA3 AT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND TO A+/A1 AT THE HOLDING

COMPANY, THE FIRMS FUNDING COSTS AND CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESSES WERE NOT

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE PROPOSALS RELATING TO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES FOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND HAS POSTED THE

BOARDS PRACTICES, AS WELL AS CHARTERS OF THE PRINCIPAL BOARD COMMITTEES, ON

THE FIRMS WEBSITE, WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. THE FIRM SEEKS TO BE A LEADER IN

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND ACTIVITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE EXPECTED TO

REMAIN UNCERTAIN IN 2003. ACCORDINGLY, THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRMS INVESTMENT

BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES REMAINS CAUTIOUS. EARNINGS IMPROVEMENTS

IN IB ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN IN 2003 BY LOWER CREDIT COSTS IN

A STILL CHALLENGING  BUT STABILIZING  CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND BY LOWER

EXPENSES. AT CFS, CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT LOW-INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT

SHOULD ENABLE THE CREDIT-RELATED BUSINESSES (MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTO)

TO PERFORM WELL, ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY REVENUES AND EARNINGS WILL BE LOWER

THAN THE RECORD SET IN 2002, WHICH INCLUDED LARGE NET GAINS ON HEDGING OF

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS).

EXPENSES FOR THE FIRM IN 2003 MAY BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2002 (EXCLUDING

FROM 2002 EXPENSES THE IMPACT OF THE LITIGATION AND MERGER CHARGES). EXPENSING

STOCK OPTIONS, HIGHER PENSION AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AND INCREASED SPENDING

(PRIMARILY AT CFS) ARE LIKELY TO MORE THAN OFFSET THE SAVINGS ANTICIPATED FROM

IB RIGHT-SIZING INITIATIVES AND LOWER SEVERANCE COSTS.

DESPITE THIS CAUTIOUS VIEW FOR THE SHORT TERM, THE FIRM REMAINS COMMITTED TO

ITS DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS MODEL AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS WELL POSITIONED TO

PRODUCE HIGHER RETURNS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVE AND CAPITAL MARKETS

RECOVER.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THIS SECTION DISCUSSES JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON A REPORTED

BASIS. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL DATA CONFORMS WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). THE SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES BEGINNING ON PAGE 71.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE 24% LOWER THAN LAST YEAR, REFLECTING THE

INDUSTRY-WIDE SLOWDOWN IN CORPORATE M&A ACTIVITIES AND NEW ISSUANCE OF DEBT AND

EQUITY SECURITIES. ADVISORY FEES OF $756 MILLION WERE 39% LOWER THAN LAST YEAR,

AND UNDERWRITING FEES FOR DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF $2.0 BILLION WERE 15%

LOWER THAN LAST YEAR. FOR A TABLE THAT BREAKS OUT INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, SEE

NOTE 4 ON PAGE 77, AND FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THESE REVENUES, SEE THE IB

RESULTS ON PAGES 2628.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

18

EQUITY MARKETS DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY, CONTRIBUTING TO LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY

AND REVENUES, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY DERIVATIVES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO LOWER

EQUITY TRADING RESULTS WAS A SHIFT IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF BROKER-DEALER

TRADING REVENUES, FROM TRADING REVENUES IN 2001 TO BROKERAGE AND

INVESTMENT SERVICES FEES IN 2002. BEGINNING IN 2001, BID AND OFFER PRICES ON

NASDAQ STOCKS WERE QUOTED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS, INSTEAD OF FRACTIONS OF WHOLE

DOLLARS. AS A RESULT, IN 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE BEGAN TO NEGOTIATE WITH ITS

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS COMMISSION-BASED PRICING STRUCTURES THAT WOULD SUPPORT

THE COSTS OF DELIVERING ENHANCED BROKERAGE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR

NASDAQ TRADES. REVENUES EARNED FROM AGREED-UPON COMMISSIONS ARE NOW RECORDED

AS BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES WITHIN FEES AND COMMISSIONS.

FIXED INCOME TRADING REVENUES DECLINED 33% FROM LAST YEAR, AS LOWER PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT RESULTS, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST RATE TRADING, OFFSET AN OVERALL

INCREASE IN CLIENT ACTIVITY.

TRADING REVENUE, ON A REPORTED BASIS, EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NET INTEREST

INCOME RELATED TO IBS TRADING ACTIVITIES; THIS INCOME IS RECORDED WITHIN NET

INTEREST INCOME. HOWEVER, IN ASSESSING THE PROFITABILITY OF IBS TRADING

BUSINESS, THE FIRM COMBINES THESE REVENUES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING. FOR A TABLE

THAT BREAKS OUT TRADING REVENUES, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGE 76, AND FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION ON THESE REVENUES, SEE THE IB RESULTS ON PAGES 2628.

FEES AND COMMISSIONS

FEES AND COMMISSIONS WERE $10.8 BILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 13% FROM LAST

YEAR, REFLECTING THE FOLLOWING.



MORTGAGE SERVICING FEES WERE $298 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $230

MILLION IN 2001, STEMMING FROM THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CHASE HOME

FINANCES HEDGING OF MSRS. IN 2002, HEDGING GAINS RESULTING FROM WIDER

MORTGAGE SWAP SPREADS AND A FAVORABLE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE OFFSETTING IMPAIRMENT OF THE MSRS VALUE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE FEES, SEE THE CHASE HOME FINANCE

DISCUSSION ON PAGE 36.



CREDIT CARD REVENUE OF $2.9 BILLION WAS A RECORD FOR THE FIRM. REVENUES

WERE 36% ABOVE 2001, REFLECTING THE POSITIVE IMPACT ON SERVICING FEES

FROM THE GROWTH IN SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES MANAGED BY CHASE CARDMEMBER

SERVICES; AVERAGE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES GREW BY MORE THAN $8.5

BILLION. THE INCREASE IN CREDIT CARD REVENUE ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF THE PROVIDIAN ACQUISITION, HIGHER LATE CHARGES AND HIGHER INTERCHANGE

INCOME AS A RESULT OF INCREASED PURCHASE VOLUME. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD BUSINESS REVENUES, SEE PAGE 37.



OTHER LENDING-RELATED SERVICE FEES INCREASED 10%, A RESULT OF HIGHER

STANDBY LETTER-OF-CREDIT FEES FROM NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE HIGHER AUTO LOAN SERVICING FEES, THE

RESULT OF INCREASED SECURITIZATIONS IN 2002.



DEPOSIT SERVICE FEES WERE 10% ABOVE 2001. LOWER INTEREST RATES REDUCED

THE VALUE OF CUSTOMERS COMPENSATING DEPOSIT BALANCES; CONSEQUENTLY,

CUSTOMERS PAID INCREASED FEES FOR DEPOSIT SERVICES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO

THE INCREASE WERE HIGHER CASH MANAGEMENT FEES, PRIMARILY AT TREASURY

SERVICES, REFLECTING GROWTH IN PAYMENT PROCESSING VOLUMES FROM

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS.

THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS WERE OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT,

CUSTODY AND PROCESSING SERVICE FEES. THESE FEES WERE DOWN 5% TO $3.8 BILLION

IN 2002, PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE LOWER VALUE OF EQUITY-RELATED ASSETS UNDER

SUPERVISION AT IMPB, AS WELL AS LOWER FEES EARNED AT T&SS FROM NON-U.S.

ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY. BOTH INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND CUSTODY FEES WERE

AFFECTED BY THE DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION AND ASSETS

UNDER CUSTODY, RESPECTIVELY, AS THESE FEES ARE GENERALLY CALCULATED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSETS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

LOWER FEES WAS THE MARKET-DRIVEN SLOWDOWN IN SECURITIES LENDING, AS WELL AS A

DECREASE IN PROCESSING SERVICE FEES FOR UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS.

BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES DECLINED SLIGHTLY, DESPITE THE AFOREMENTIONED

RECLASSIFICATION INTO THIS LINE OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF BROKER-DEALER

REVENUES RELATED TO NASDAQ TRANSACTIONS. THE DECLINE WAS THE RESULT OF REDUCED

TRADING VOLUME AND NARROWER SPREADS ON BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS.

FOR A TABLE SHOWING THE COMPONENTS OF FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGE 77.

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS (LOSSES)

AGGREGATE PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) TOTALED $746 MILLION

IN 2002, REFLECTING THE CONTINUING DIFFICULT CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT. THE

PRIVATE EQUITY MARKETS OFFERED LIMITED EXIT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINED

FINANCING, THEREBY DEPRESSING REALIZED GAINS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS IN 2002

REFLECTED NET MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON PUBLIC SECURITIES, AS WELL AS

WRITE-DOWNS AND WRITE-OFFS ON PRIVATE HOLDINGS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY SECTORS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS (LOSSES), SEE JPMP RESULTS ON PAGES 3334.

SECURITIES GAINS

SECURITIES GAINS OF $1.6 BILLION WERE UP 80% FROM LAST YEAR. OF THESE GAINS,

$1.1 BILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRMS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS)

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS FAVORABLY POSITIONED IN A LOWER

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE BALANCE WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HEDGING OF

MSRS THAT OFFSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DUE TO MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, SEE BOTH THE IB AND CHASE HOME FINANCE

DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 2628 AND 36, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER REVENUE

THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUE OF $260 MILLION REFLECTED THE FOLLOWING.



INCREASED REVENUES FROM RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND SALES

ACTIVITIES, TO $671 MILLION IN 2002 FROM $576 MILLION IN 2001, WERE

DRIVEN BY THE SURGE IN LOAN APPLICATIONS AND ORIGINATIONS. THE GROWTH IN

ORIGINATIONS ALLOWED FOR LARGER VOLUMES OF LOAN SALES AND

SECURITIZATIONS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS REVENUE, SEE CHASE

HOME FINANCE ON PAGE 36.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.



UNFAVORABLE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS WERE $36 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $177

MILLION IN 2001. THE ADJUSTMENT IN 2002 WAS RELATED TO RESIDUAL

POSITIONS HELD AFTER THE COMPLETION OF LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND COMMERCIAL

REAL ESTATE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. THESE RESIDUAL POSITIONS ARE RECORDED

AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET VALUE. THE HIGHER NEGATIVE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS IN 2001 PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOANS IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTORS.

FOR A TABLE THAT BREAKS OUT OTHER REVENUE, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGE 78.

NET INTEREST INCOME

NET INTEREST INCOME (NII) ROSE 7% TO $11.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $10.8

BILLION IN 2001. THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE INCREASE WERE THE

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN AVERAGE CONSUMER LOANS, WHICH WERE 7% HIGHER THAN LAST

YEAR, AND HIGHER TRADING-RELATED NII. THESE WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN

COMMERCIAL LOANS AND THE NARROWING OF SPREADS IN THE DEPOSIT BUSINESSES.

AVERAGE CONSUMER LOAN VOLUME GREW, BENEFITING FROM LOW INTEREST RATES, AS

WELL AS THE ACQUISITION IN FEBRUARY 2002 OF THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST,

INCLUDING $7.9 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND RELATED RELATIONSHIPS.

TOTAL AVERAGE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ROSE 11% TO $21.6 BILLION; OF THIS

AMOUNT $4.8 BILLION RELATED TO PROVIDIAN. NII AT CHASE HOME FINANCE INCREASED

DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MORTGAGE LOANS, HIGHER SPREADS AND

LOWER ASSET FUNDING COSTS.

NII RELATED TO COMMERCIAL LOANS DECLINED, THE RESULT OF LOWER OUTSTANDING

VOLUMES. AT THE SAME TIME, SPREADS NARROWED, REFLECTING THE REDUCTION IN

INTEREST RATES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WAS THE HIGHER LEVEL OF

NONPERFORMING LOANS. NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS ROSE 84% TO $3.7 BILLION.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF NONPERFORMING LOANS IN THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO,

SEE PAGE 47.

A PORTION OF THE FIRMS NII RELATES TO TRADING-RELATED ASSETS. IN 2002, THIS

COMPONENT WAS $1.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF TRADING ASSETS

AND IMPROVED SPREADS.

ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS, THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS FOR

2002 WERE $555 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $547 BILLION LAST YEAR. THE NET

INTEREST SPREAD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS

2.09% IN 2002, 10 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2002 WAS $11.0 BILLION, 7% LOWER THAN LAST YEAR, AND

INCLUDED SEVERANCE COSTS OF $746 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH EXPENSE INITIATIVES

UNDERTAKEN DURING THE YEAR. IN 2001, SEVERANCE RELATED TO THE MERGER OF J.P.

MORGAN AND CHASE AND OTHER PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS WAS

RECORDED WITHIN MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS. THE DECLINE REFLECTED

REDUCTIONS IN STAFFING LEVELS, AS WELL AS LOWER INCENTIVES REFLECTING THE

LOWER LEVEL OF EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR INCENTIVES ARE SUBJECT TO

MANAGEMENTS DISCRETION AND TO CALCULATIONS THAT CORRELATE INCENTIVES WITH

INCOME BEFORE INCENTIVES.

EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN IB AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, IMPB, THE TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS WHOSE REVENUES WERE MOST NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. AS A RESULT, THESE TWO SEGMENTS

REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN THEIR BUSINESSES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

DECLINE IN EXPENSES WAS THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $120

MILLION RELATED TO FORFEITABLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS ISSUED UNDER

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. THE AWARDS CONTAINED STOCK PRICE TARGETS THAT WERE

DEEMED UNLIKELY TO BE ATTAINED WITHIN THE TIMEFRAMES SPECIFIED UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE AWARDS.

THE DECLINE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE HIRING OF NEW

EMPLOYEES AT EXPANDING BUSINESS SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY CFS AND T&SS.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS

94,335, COMPARED WITH 95,812 AT THE PRIOR YEAR-END. ALTHOUGH OVERALL LEVELS

REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE, HEADCOUNT IN IB AND IMPB WAS REDUCED BY

APPROXIMATELY 3,100 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES, WHEREAS IN CFS HEADCOUNT

INCREASED BY MORE THAN 2,400.

THE FIRM REVIEWS THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR ITS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. TO REFLECT THE DECLINE IN

MARKET INTEREST RATES DURING 2002, THE YEAR-END DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE FIRMS

U.S. PLANS WAS SET AT 6.50%, A 75-BASIS POINT DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

ADDITIONALLY, CONSIDERING THE CURRENT MIX OF PLAN ASSETS, THE YEAR-END ASSUMED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN WAS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD TO 8.00% FOR BOTH U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, FROM 9.25% AND

9.00%, RESPECTIVELY. THE ASSUMED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS A BLENDED AVERAGE

OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE 2003 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES BY

APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF LOSSES ON U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER INCREASE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION. IN 2002, THESE

EXPENSES INCLUDED CURTAILMENT CHARGES AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS

TOTALING $64 MILLION RESULTING FROM MANAGEMENT-INITIATED AND

OUTSOURCING-RELATED EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS. ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE

FIRMS VARIOUS NON-U.S. PLANS ALSO WERE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT LOCAL MARKET

CONDITIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON NON-

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

20

U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE

MATERIAL. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS,

SEE NOTE 23 ON PAGES 9496.

OCCUPANCY EXPENSE

OCCUPANCY EXPENSE ROSE 19% FROM LAST YEAR, PARTLY THE RESULT OF A $98 MILLION

CHARGE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 TO COVER THE COSTS OF EXITING EXCESS

VACANT PREMISES ON THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES, PRINCIPALLY IN THE SAN

FRANCISCO AREA. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS THE LEASING OF

ADDITIONAL SPACE IN NEW JERSEY AND IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, PARTLY NECESSITATED

BY THE RELOCATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR FROM A

PREVIOUSLY-OWNED BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN. THE FIRM EXPECTS 2003

OCCUPANCY COSTS TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION DUE TO THE MOVE TO

MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, EXTRA SAFETY MEASURES AND HIGHER ANTICIPATED REAL ESTATE

TAXES IN NEW YORK.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE

THE DECLINE IN TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INITIATIVE TO RATIONALIZE AND RESHAPE THE FIRMS TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS INITIATIVE RESULTED IN REDUCED SPENDING FOR SOFTWARE,

EQUIPMENT AND WORKSTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE TECHNOLOGY SOURCING PROCESS WAS

STREAMLINED IN FAVOR OF A SELECT LIST OF PREFERRED VENDORS, RESULTING IN

ADDITIONAL EXPENSE REDUCTIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, AS WELL AS

EXPENDITURES TO ENHANCE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES DECLINED 56% FROM 2001. THE DECLINE PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS 142, WHICH NOW REQUIRES A PERIODIC

REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT RATHER THAN THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL,

AS WAS THE CASE LAST YEAR. THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE

ACQUISITION OF THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUSTS CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIP

INTANGIBLES. IN 2002, THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED ON GOODWILL

RECORDED THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. FOR A DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF

SFAS 142 ON THE FIRMS AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES EXPENSE AND THE EXPECTED

LEVEL OF EXPENSE FOR 2003, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGE 89.

OTHER EXPENSE

OTHER EXPENSE INCREASED 6% IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 AS A RESULT OF THE

FOLLOWING (FOR THE TABLE SHOWING THE COMPONENTS WITHIN OTHER EXPENSE, SEE NOTE

6 ON PAGE 79).



PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE INCREASED $164 MILLION FROM 2001,

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LEGAL FEES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE

WAS THE HIRING OF PROFESSIONALS WHO ASSISTED IN THE COLLECTION OF CREDIT

CARD ACCOUNTS AND FEES PAID BY IB FOR SUB-ADVISOR SERVICES FOR A FUND IN

EUROPE. THESE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE ITEMS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER

SYSTEMS CONSULTANT COSTS.



HIGHER OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSE OF $106 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY THE COSTS OF

SERVICING THE PROVIDIAN CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO AND PROCESSING HIGHER MORTGAGE

SERVICING VOLUME. DURING A TRANSITION PERIOD, FROM THE ACQUISITION IN

FEBRUARY UNTIL AUGUST 2002, PROVIDIAN FINANCIAL CORP. PROVIDED SERVICING FOR

THE PORTFOLIO.



HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE OF $88 MILLION PRINCIPALLY STEMMED FROM

DIRECT-MARKETING CAMPAIGNS FOR CREDIT CARDS.

THESE EXPENSE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSE OF $42 MILLION.

SURETY SETTLEMENT AND LITIGATION RESERVE

THE $1.3 BILLION CHARGE IN 2002 REFLECTED THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON-RELATED

SURETY LITIGATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LITIGATION RESERVE. ON JANUARY 2,

2003, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED IT HAD SETTLED ITS DISPUTE WITH 11 INSURANCE COMPANIES

THAT HAD ISSUED SURETY BONDS THAT GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS OF ENRON CORP.

(ENRON) UNDER PREPAID COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS. THE FIRM SETTLED FOR 60%

OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND RECEIVED A CASH PAYMENT OF $502

MILLION AND $75 MILLION OF UNSECURED CLAIMS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT

 AND ONE ADDITIONAL, ONGOING LAWSUIT RELATED TO A PREPAID CONTRACT BACKED BY

A LETTER OF CREDIT  THE FIRM TOOK A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $400 MILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THE FIRM ALSO ESTABLISHED A $900

MILLION RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING ENRON, AS WELL AS OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL

ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH IT IS INVOLVED.

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS

DURING 2002, THE FIRM INCURRED MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $1.2

BILLION, A 52% DECLINE FROM 2001. REFER TO THE DISCUSSION OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE ON PAGE 20 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OTHER SEVERANCE COSTS INCURRED IN

2002 AND TO NOTE 6 ON PAGE 78.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED $1.1 BILLION OR 36% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE SECTORS. THE CONSUMER

PROVISION DECREASED 21% FROM LAST YEAR REFLECTING GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROVIDIAN ACQUISITION.

IN 2002, THE FIRM INCREASED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BY $443 MILLION

(BY MAKING PROVISIONS IN EXCESS OF NET CHARGE-OFFS), COMPARED WITH AN $850

MILLION INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE LAST YEAR. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE PAGE 56.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $856 MILLION IN 2002,

COMPARED WITH $847 MILLION IN 2001. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34% IN 2002,

VERSUS 33% LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LEVEL OF INCOME IN CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL TAX

JURISDICTIONS IN 2002. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAXES, SEE NOTE 22

ON PAGES 93 AND 94.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING BASIS

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP APPEAR ON PAGES 7174 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT

PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER

WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE CONSISTENTLY TRACKED

FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH

OTHER COMPANIES GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT

LOOKS AT RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS TO ASSESS EACH OF ITS BUSINESSES AND

TO MEASURE OVERALL FIRM RESULTS AGAINST TARGETED GOALS. THE DEFINITION OF

OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED GAAP RESULTS AND THEN EXCLUDES THE

IMPACT OF MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS, CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, THE

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND SPECIAL ITEMS (WHICH MANAGEMENT DEFINED DURING

2002 AS SIGNIFICANT NONRECURRING GAINS OR LOSSES OF $75 MILLION OR MORE).

BOTH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND SPECIAL ITEMS ARE VIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AS

TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS

OR ARE UNUSUAL IN NATURE AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF TRENDS.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE FIRMS

REPORTED AND OPERATING RESULTS.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, OPERATING RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE PERIODICALLY SECURITIZES A PORTION OF ITS

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO BY SELLING A POOL OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST,

WHICH ISSUES SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. WHEN CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ARE

SECURITIZED, THE FIRM CEASES TO ACCRUE THE RELATED INTEREST AND CREDIT COSTS;

INSTEAD, THE FIRM RECEIVES FEE REVENUE FOR CONTINUING TO SERVICE THOSE

RECEIVABLES AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM ANY INTEREST AND FEES ON THE

RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST PAID TO INVESTORS, NET OF CREDIT LOSSES

AND SERVICING FEES. AS A RESULT, SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE JPMORGAN

CHASES REPORTED OR OPERATING NET INCOME; HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE

CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

THE FIRM ALSO REPORTS CREDIT COSTS ON A MANAGED OR OPERATING BASIS.

CREDIT COSTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS ARE COMPOSED OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (WHICH INCLUDES A PROVISION

FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) AS WELL AS THE

CREDIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS. AS THE HOLDER OF

THE RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THE SECURITIZATION TRUST, THE FIRM BEARS ITS SHARE

OF THE CREDIT COSTS FOR SECURITIZED LOANS. IN THE FIRMS GAAP FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CREDIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS REDUCE

THE NONINTEREST INCOME REMITTED TO THE FIRM FROM THE TRUST. THIS INCOME IS

REPORTED IN CREDIT CARD REVENUE IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS OVER THE LIFE OF THE

SECURITIZATION.

COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2002, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 142 AND, ACCORDINGLY, CEASED

AMORTIZING GOODWILL. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS

142. PRIOR-PERIOD OPERATING EARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BY ADDING BACK

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL TO REPORT RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE WITH 2002.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

SEGMENT RESULTS

THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE KNOWN GLOBALLY AS JPMORGAN

AND ARE COMPRISED OF THE INVESTMENT BANK, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES,

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING AND JPMORGAN PARTNERS. THE RETAIL AND

MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESSES ARE KNOWN AS CHASE AND MAKE UP CHASE FINANCIAL

SERVICES.

JPMORGAN CHASES SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL

INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT. THE FIRM

ALLOCATES EQUITY TO ITS BUSINESS UNITS UTILIZING A RISK-ADJUSTED METHODOLOGY,

WHICH QUANTIFIES CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISKS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS

AND, FOR JPMP, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THOSE RISKS, SEE THE

RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION ON PAGES 45-65. THE FIRM ALLOCATES ADDITIONAL EQUITY

TO ITS BUSINESSES INCORPORATING AN ASSET CAPITAL TAX ON MANAGED ASSETS AND

SOME OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION, BUSINESSES ARE ALLOCATED

EQUITY EQUAL TO 100% OF GOODWILL AND 50% FOR CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLES

GENERATED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE PORTFOLIO EFFECT ON

REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL BASED ON CORRELATIONS OF RISK ACROSS RISK

CATEGORIES. THIS ESTIMATED DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT IS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FIRM USES THE SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED (SVA) FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE

PERFORMANCE OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. TO DERIVE SVA FOR ITS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, THE FIRM APPLIES A 12% (AFTER-TAX) COST OF EQUITY TO EACH SEGMENT,

EXCEPT JPMP; THIS BUSINESS IS CHARGED A 15% (AFTER-TAX) COST OF EQUITY. THE

CAPITAL ELEMENTS AND RESULTANT CAPITAL CHARGES PROVIDE THE BUSINESSES WITH

THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE USE OF CAPITAL

BY EACH BUSINESS UNIT VERSUS ITS RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS. CAPITAL CHARGES ARE

AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SVA MEASUREMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS. UNDER THE FIRMS

ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL, ECONOMIC CAPITAL IS OVERALLOCATED TO

SEGMENTS, AS COMPARED WITH THE FIRMS TOTAL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. THE

REVENUE AND SVA IMPACT OF THE OVERALLOCATION IS REPORTED IN SUPPORT UNITS AND

CORPORATE. (SEE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON PAGE 114 FOR A DEFINITION OF SVA AND

PAGE 39 FOR MORE DETAILS).

IN ALLOCATING THE ALLOWANCE (AND PROVISION) FOR CREDIT LOSSES, EACH BUSINESS

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CREDIT COSTS, INCLUDING ACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS AND

CHANGES IN THE SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE. THE RESIDUAL

COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, AVAILABLE FOR LOSSES IN ANY BUSINESS SEGMENT, IS

MAINTAINED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT AS

NECESSARY TO ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, PRIMARILY IN THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO.

THE SEGMENT RESULTS ALSO REFLECT REVENUE- AND EXPENSE-SHARING AGREEMENTS

BETWEEN CERTAIN LINES OF BUSINESS. IN 2002, AGREEMENTS BETWEEN TREASURY

SERVICES AND MIDDLE MARKET WERE REVISED, AND PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED

TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ATTRIBUTED TO

THEIR SHARED ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, AND THE

DOUBLE COUNTING IS ELIMINATED AT EACH OF THE SEGMENTS (E.G., TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES AND CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES). THESE ARRANGEMENTS PROMOTE

CROSS-SELLING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHARED CLIENT EXPENSES. THEY ALSO ENSURE THAT

THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF BOTH BUSINESSES ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED.

PRIOR-PERIOD SEGMENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ALIGNMENT OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CHANGES IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

AMONG BUSINESSES. RESTATEMENTS OF SEGMENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

PERFORMANCE AT THE INVESTMENT BANK (IB) IS INFLUENCED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS,

INCLUDING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CAPITAL MARKETS AND

IBS CLIENTS. CHANGES IN MARKET SHARE, RISKS AND EXPENSES CAN ALSO IMPACT

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE YEAR 2002 PRESENTED A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC AND

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT FOR INVESTMENT BANKING. IN RESPONSE, IB INCREASED ITS

FOCUS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS, AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT

OF STAFFING AND EXPENSE LEVELS. WHILE THE OUTLOOK FOR 2003 REMAINS UNCERTAIN,

IB BELIEVES IT IS WELL POSITIONED TO IMPROVE RESULTS AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS RECOVER.

REFLECTING THE DIFFICULT MARKET ENVIRONMENT IN 2002, IBS OPERATING MARGIN

DECLINED 25% FROM LAST YEAR. OPERATING REVENUE DECLINED 15%, DRIVEN BY A

REDUCTION IN CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING REVENUE AND IN INVESTMENT BANKING

FEES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 9% DECLINE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. CREDIT

COSTS ROSE TO $2.4 BILLION IN 2002. THE LOWER OPERATING MARGIN TOGETHER WITH

HIGHER CREDIT COSTS RESULTED IN

OPERATING EARNINGS

OF $1.4 BILLION, A DECLINE

OF 53% FROM 2001.

FIXED INCOME

INCLUDES REVENUES FROM MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND FROM

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE

COMPLETE RANGE OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MARKETS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND

CORPORATE DEBT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITIES MARKETS).

TREASURY

AND LOAN SALE ACTIVITY FOR THE INVESTMENT BANKS COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

ADDITIONALLY, CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT

VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), WHICH IS THE COMPONENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF A

DERIVATIVE THAT REFLECTS THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY (SEE PAGE 51

OF CREDIT RISK FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CVA). CREDIT PORTFOLIO

REVENUES ALSO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO HEDGING

FROM 2001, DRIVEN BY LOWER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESULTS RELATED TO

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND LOWER RESULTS WITHIN PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING

ACTIVITIES, WHICH OFFSET HIGHER CLIENT TRADING ACTIVITIES. OFFSETTING THE

TOTAL-RETURN REVENUE DECLINE WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF GLOBAL TREASURY, WHICH

PRODUCED STRONG RETURNS IN FIXED INCOME MARKETS. GLOBAL TREASURYS

TOTAL-RETURN REVENUES OF $1.5 BILLION WERE UP 59% FROM LAST YEAR. CREDIT

PORTFOLIO REVENUES WERE $1.4 BILLION, UP 32% FROM 2001; LOSSES RELATED TO

EXPOSURE TO ENRON AND ARGENTINA DEPRESSED 2001 RESULTS. THE 55% DECLINE IN

EQUITIES FROM 2001 TO $1.0 BILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN EQUITY DERIVATIVES AND LOWER CLIENT REVENUES. ON AN

OPERATING REVENUE BASIS, CAPITAL MARKETS REVENUES OF $9.7 BILLION IN 2002

WERE 12% BELOW 2001.

DECLINED 9% FROM 2001 AND INCLUDED $587 MILLION OF SEVERANCE

THESE COSTS, EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN 16%, WITH COMPENSATION COSTS DOWN

25% AND NONCOMPENSATION COSTS DOWN 2% FROM 2001. THE DECLINE IN COMPENSATION

COSTS REFLECTED LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER

STAFFING LEVELS. LOWER NONCOMPENSATION COSTS REFLECTED DECLINES IN TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT COSTS AND LOWER TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS COSTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER LEGAL COSTS. INCLUDING THE SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS, THE

OVERHEAD RATIO FOR 2002 WAS 64%, COMPARED WITH 60% IN 2001. EXCLUDING THE

SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS, THE OVERHEAD RATIO WAS 60% IN 2002.

IN OCTOBER 2002, IB COMPLETED A REVIEW OF ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES. THE ANALYSIS

UNDERSCORED THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS INTEGRATED BUSINESS MODEL, THE BREADTH OF

ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE CLIENT FRANCHISE. TO IMPROVE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, IB ANNOUNCED A SERIES

OF INITIATIVES INTENDED TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS ENABLE SELECTIVE

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. THESE INITIATIVES, WHICH BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002, ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION OF SAVINGS AND

RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN STAFFING LEVELS OF MORE THAN 2,000, AS WELL AS A

REDUCTION IN CONSULTANTS EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM. SEVERANCE AND OTHER COSTS

RELATED TO THESE INITIATIVES ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION,

WITH $293 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 AND THE REMAINING

COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 2003. ANOTHER $294 MILLION OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED

COSTS RECORDED IN 2002 RELATED TO INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

IN A REVENUE ENVIRONMENT SIMILAR TO 2002, AND WITH CREDIT COSTS SUBSTANTIALLY

LOWER THAN IN 2002, THESE INITIATIVES WOULD ENABLE THE INVESTMENT BANK TO

TARGET A RETURN ON EQUITY OF 12% IN 2003.

CREDIT COSTS

INCREASED 108%, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS,

PRIMARILY IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND CABLE SECTORS, AND PROVISIONS IN EXCESS

OF CHARGE-OFFS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

OPERATING EARNINGS

INCREASED 7% OVER

2001 AND DELIVERED A RETURN ON EQUITY OF 23%. EXPENSE DISCIPLINE MITIGATED A

WEAK REVENUE ENVIRONMENT. REVENUE GROWTH OF 2% WAS LIMITED BY WEAKNESS IN THE

ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS.

OPERATING REVENUE

INCREASE OF 2% WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH AT INSTITUTIONAL TRUST

SERVICES (ITS) OF 14%. GROWTH CAME MAINLY FROM NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES IN

GLOBAL SECURITIES CLEARANCE AND SECURITIZATION SERVICES. ACQUISITIONS ALSO

PROVIDED GROWTH, MOST NOTABLY SYSTEMS & SERVICES TECHNOLOGIES, INC., A

THIRD-PARTY AND BACKUP SERVICER SPECIALIZING IN SUBPRIME AUTO RECEIVABLES,

WHICH GENERATED $40 MILLION OF NEW REVENUE IN 2002. REVENUE AT TREASURY

SERVICES ROSE 5% ON HIGHER REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH MIDDLE MARKET CUSTOMERS,

INCREASED VOLUMES, NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND HIGHER BALANCE DEFICIENCY

FEES. REVENUE AT INVESTOR SERVICES CONTRACTED 9% AS THE VALUE OF ASSETS HELD

IN CUSTODY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FEES DECLINED. FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVENUE

DROPPED, ALONG WITH SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITY DUE TO REDUCED MARKET

ACTIVITY. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES IN

2001 FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, AS CLIENTS LOOKED TO DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO HOLD CASH FUNDS. ACROSS ALL BUSINESS UNITS, LOW INTEREST

RATES HAVE REDUCED EARNINGS FROM THE VALUE OF DEPOSITS LINKED TO TRANSACTION

PROCESSING. T&SS RESULTS FOR 2002 INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $50 MILLION ON

THE SALE OF THE FIRMS INTEREST IN CENTRALE DE LIVRAISON DE VALEURS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING (IMPB)

OPERATING EARNINGS

ARE

INFLUENCED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, EQUITY

AND FIXED INCOME ASSET VALUATIONS, INVESTOR ACTIVITY LEVELS AND INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE. GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAINED WEAK IN 2002. IN ADDITION,

POOR INVESTOR SENTIMENT DRIVEN BY THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND

CONCERNS SURROUNDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE WEIGHED HEAVILY ON THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS. THESE FACTORS LED TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEPRESSED EQUITY MARKETS (THE

S&P 500 INDEX DECLINED 23% FOR THE YEAR 2002) AND REDUCED LEVELS OF INVESTOR

ACTIVITY ACROSS IMPBS PRIVATE BANKING AND RETAIL CLIENT BASES. IN RESPONSE

TO THESE CHALLENGES, IMPB UNDERTOOK RESTRUCTURING AND PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS

AND REDUCED INCENTIVES, WITHOUT IMPAIRING ITS CORE CAPABILITIES. IMPB IS

WELL POSITIONED TO ENHANCE EARNINGS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVE.

OPERATING REVENUE

OF $2.9 BILLION WAS 11% LOWER THAN LAST YEAR. INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT OPERATING REVENUES OF $1.5 BILLION DECREASED 11% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF EQUITY MARKET DEPRECIATION AND INSTITUTIONAL

OUTFLOWS ACROSS ALL ASSET CLASSES. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, BROWN &

CO., THE FIRMS SPECIALTY ONLINE BROKERAGE UNIT, WAS TRANSFERRED FROM CFS TO

IMPB AS PART OF THE FIRMS STRATEGY TO GROW ITS RETAIL ASSET MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS. (ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE

REORGANIZATION.)

PRIVATE BANKING OPERATING REVENUES OF $1.4 BILLION DECREASED 12% FROM 2001.

NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED 15%, REFLECTING THE PRIVATE BANKS SMALLER LOAN

PORTFOLIO AND LOWER DEPOSIT BALANCES, AS WELL AS NARROWER INTEREST RATE

SPREADS. FEES FROM ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT DECLINED AS A RESULT OF EQUITY

MARKET DEPRECIATION AND CLIENT OUTFLOWS IN THE EARLY PART OF 2002. BROKERAGE

COMMISSIONS DECLINED AS PRIVATE BANKING CLIENTS EXECUTED FEWER TRANSACTIONS.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN PARTNERS (JPMP) FACED A CHALLENGING YEAR IN 2002, RESULTING IN

NEGATIVE OPERATING REVENUE

OF $954 MILLION AND

OPERATING LOSSES

OF $789

MILLION. OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE VALUE THROUGH SALES OR INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERINGS (IPOS) OF INVESTMENTS WERE LIMITED, BECAUSE OF CONSTRAINED M&A

AND IPO MARKETS. IN ADDITION, JPMP RECORDED NEGATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

IN INVESTMENTS CONCENTRATED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY,

INDUSTRIES THAT CONTINUE TO FACE POOR OPERATING CONDITIONS AND LIMITED

FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES.

PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES TOTALED $733 MILLION IN 2002, CONSISTING OF LOSSES OF

$647 MILLION IN DIRECT INVESTMENTS AND $150 MILLION IN PRIVATE FUNDS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $64 MILLION IN GAINS FROM PORTFOLIO HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

DURING 2002, SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVED DIVERSIFICATION. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE PORTFOLIO WAS $8.2 BILLION, A REDUCTION OF $1.0 BILLION

FROM YEAR-END 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN TMT INVESTMENTS. AT THE END

OF 2002, TMT INVESTMENTS WERE $1.5 BILLION, OR 18%, OF THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO,

COMPARED WITH $2.5 BILLION, OR 27%, OF THE PORTFOLIO AT YEAR-END 2001.

INDUSTRIAL GROWTH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCREASED TO 27% OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, FROM 22% AT THE END OF 2001, REFLECTING INCREASED

INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRIAL BUYOUT ACTIVITY DURING 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMPS PUBLIC SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS $520 MILLION, A

48% DECLINE FROM 2001 AND LESS THAN ONE-SIXTH OF THE $3.4 BILLION PUBLIC

SECURITIES BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 1999. THE 2002 DECLINE RESULTED FROM LOWER

MARKET VALUATIONS AND FROM ACCELERATED SALES OF PUBLIC SECURITIES THAT WERE NOT

SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS. THESE SALES OF PUBLIC SECURITIES REDUCED THE EARNINGS

VOLATILITY CREATED BY THIS PORTFOLIO SEGMENT.

ALTHOUGH 2002 REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF PUBLICLY-HELD

SECURITIES IN JPMPS PORTFOLIO, THIS PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO COULD

INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, BOTH IN DOLLAR AMOUNT AND AS A PROPORTION OF THE

TOTAL PORTFOLIO, DUE TO CHANGES IN EQUITY MARKET PRICES AND IPO

OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE LIMITED SALES AND FINANCING ACTIVITY IN PRIVATE EQUITY

MARKETS, CONSTRAINING REALIZATION OPPORTUNITIES.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REGARD JPMP AS A STRATEGIC BUSINESS THAT WILL CREATE

VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM. JPMP IS SEEKING TO REDUCE OR EXIT SELECTED

BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT CENTRAL TO ITS OPERATIONS WITH THE

GOAL THAT, OVER TIME, JPMPS PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO WILL BE REDUCED FROM

APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2002, TO APPROXIMATELY 10%.

JPMPS DIVERSIFIED PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO BY INDUSTRY

GROUP% OF CARRYING VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES (CFS)

OPERATING EARNINGS

INCREASED 62% TO A RECORD

$2.5 BILLION IN 2002. SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED ALMOST TRIPLED TO $1.2 BILLION,

AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY INCREASED TO 24% FROM 17% LAST YEAR. REVENUE GROWTH

OF 24% REFLECTED HIGH BUSINESS VOLUMES ACROSS ALL CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESSES

AND SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN HOME FINANCE ON THE HEDGING OF MSRS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS. EXPENSES INCREASED

14% AS A RESULT OF HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIX SIGMA AND

OTHER PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS. THE OVERHEAD RATIO IMPROVED IN 2002 TO 47%, DOWN

FROM 51% IN 2001. CREDIT COSTS INCREASED, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE

LOANS.

THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT CFS OPERATING REVENUE AND EARNINGS WILL BE

LOWER IN 2003 DUE TO REDUCED MSR HEDGING GAINS AND THE IMPACT OF

DECLINING INTEREST RATES ON ITS DEPOSIT BUSINESSES.

OPERATING REVENUE

EXCEEDED $13.5 BILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 24% FROM

2001. THE NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESSES DROVE THE REVENUE INCREASE.

HOME FINANCE REVENUES INCREASED 73% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY STRONG

MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND GAINS ON THE HEDGING OF MSRS. CREDIT CARD REVENUES

INCREASED 34% DUE TO THE PROVIDIAN ACQUISITION, LOWER FUNDING COSTS AND

HIGHER PURCHASE VOLUME. AUTO FINANCE REVENUES GREW 26%, DRIVEN BY

ORIGINATIONS OF OVER $25 BILLION AND LOWER FUNDING COSTS. MIDDLE MARKET

REVENUES INCREASED 4%, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN AVERAGE DEPOSIT VOLUME AND HIGHER

FEES FOR DEPOSIT SERVICES; THE LOW-INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT REDUCED THE

VALUE OF CUSTOMERS DEPOSIT BALANCES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, INCREASED DEPOSIT

FEES. REGIONAL BANKING REVENUES DECLINED 9% ON LOWER DEPOSIT SPREADS

RESULTING FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPOSIT

VOLUME.

OPERATING EXPENSE

ROSE 14% TO $6.4 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE

ACQUISITION OF THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST, GROWTH IN CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESS

VOLUMES, HIGHER INCENTIVE COSTS ON BETTER BUSINESS RESULTS AND HIGHER CREDIT

CARD MARKETING EXPENDITURES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE ALMOST

$250 MILLION IN EXPENSE SAVINGS ACHIEVED THROUGH SIX SIGMA AND OTHER

PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS. THE OVERHEAD RATIO IMPROVED TO 47% FROM 51% A YEAR AGO,

AS A RESULT OF BOTH REVENUE INCREASES AND EXPENSE INITIATIVES.

CREDIT COSTS

, ON A MANAGED BASIS, INCREASED 10%, DRIVEN BY A 23% INCREASE

IN CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING THE PROVIDIAN PORTFOLIO. CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE CARD PORTFOLIO REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE, THE RESULT OF

PROACTIVE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCED COLLECTIONS INITIATIVES. CFS

INCREASED ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2002 BY $233 MILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PROVIDIAN ACQUISITION. HIGHER SECURITIZATIONS,

HOWEVER, MITIGATED THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

CHF IS THE FOURTH-LARGEST MORTGAGE ORIGINATOR AND THE FOURTH-LARGEST MORTGAGE

SERVICER IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH MORE THAN 4 MILLION CUSTOMERS. IN 2002,

CHF CAPITALIZED ON A RECORD YEAR FOR THE U.S. MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AS

HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND

FAVORABLE MARGINS. CHF EXPERIENCED ITS OWN RECORD YEAR, WITH TOTAL REVENUES

AND OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASING 73% AND 136%, RESPECTIVELY, DEMONSTRATING

CHFS STRENGTH IN BOTH ORIGINATION AND SERVICING.

DURING 2002, CHF SUCCESSFULLY SHIFTED ITS ORIGINATION GROWTH INTO

HIGHER-MARGIN BUSINESS SECTORS. LOAN ORIGINATIONS IN THESE HIGHER-MARGIN

SECTORS (I.E., RETAIL, WHOLESALE, TELEPHONE-BASED AND E-COMMERCE)

CONTRIBUTED TO A RECORD $113 BILLION IN ORIGINATION VOLUME, AN INCREASE OF

30% OVER 2001. AS PART OF THIS INCREASE IN ORIGINATION VOLUME DURING 2002,

HOME EQUITY, A STRATEGIC GROWTH AREA, ROSE 52% TO $14 BILLION. CHFS

CORRESPONDENT-NEGOTIATED BUSINESS, A LOWER-MARGIN SECTOR, WAS DOWN 56% TO

$43 BILLION, DUE TO PRICING AND MARKET CONDITIONS. LOW INTEREST RATES ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE THROUGH IMPROVED NET INTEREST

MARGINS. IN 2003, CHF WILL CONTINUE ITS INITIATIVES TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS

CONSIDERED LIKELY TO REFINANCE.

IN MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOWER INTEREST RATES LED TO HIGH PREPAYMENT LEVELS,

WHICH RESULTED IN THE ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS. IN

2002, CHF PARTNERED WITH THE FIRMS GLOBAL TREASURY GROUP TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF MSRS. GLOBAL TREASURY MANAGED THE RISK

EXPOSURE OF THE MSRS THROUGH A SERIES OF DERIVATIVES (E.G., A COMBINATION

OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS AND FLOORS) AND AFS SECURITIES THAT INCREASED IN VALUE

WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINED. DURING 2002, MSR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF

$4.1 BILLION WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $4.7 BILLION IN GAINS ON DERIVATIVES,

REALIZED GAINS FROM SALES OF AFS SECURITIES AND NET INTEREST EARNED ON AFS

SECURITIES. THE NET POSITIVE RESULT OF $582 MILLION WAS AN INCREASE OF $838

MILLION OVER 2001, DRIVEN BY WIDER MORTGAGE-SWAP SPREADS AND A FALLING

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES AN EVENTUAL DECREASE IN

THIS REVENUE CATEGORY, AS MORTGAGE-SWAP SPREADS AND INTEREST RATES REVERT

TO NORMAL LEVELS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS ALSO DECLINED $1.4 BILLION AS

A RESULT OF PERIODIC AMORTIZATION, $244 MILLION MORE THAN IN 2001. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSR ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 8788.

OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASED 28% ON THE GROWTH IN ORIGINATION VOLUME AND A

VERY HIGH LEVEL OF LOAN SERVICING ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN

PRODUCTIVITY AND BENEFITS REALIZED FROM SIX SIGMA INITIATIVES. THE OVERHEAD

RATIO DECLINED TO 44% FROM 59% IN 2001, A RESULT OF STRONG REVENUE GROWTH.

NET CHARGE-OFFS REMAINED LOW, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED STRONG CREDIT QUALITY

OF CHFS LOAN PORTFOLIO.

CCS IS THE FOURTH-LARGEST U.S. CREDIT CARD ISSUER, WITH MORE THAN $51

BILLION IN MANAGED RECEIVABLES. OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2002 WERE A RECORD

$716 MILLION, 44% GREATER THAN 2001. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS WERE THE

ACQUISITION OF THE PROVIDIAN PORTFOLIO AND OVERALL HIGHER REVENUE. THESE

RESULTS WERE ACHIEVED IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND A WEAK

U.S. ECONOMY. INDUSTRY CHALLENGES INCLUDED COMPETITIVE PRICING, INCREASED

COMPETITION FOR NEW ACCOUNTS, DEPRESSED RESPONSE RATES TO CREDIT CARD

SOLICITATIONS AS COSTS TO ACQUIRE NEW ACCOUNTS INCREASED, AND DECLINING

ACCEPTANCES TO BALANCE CONSOLIDATION OFFERS.

TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE INCREASED 34%, REFLECTING RECEIVABLES GROWTH, LOWER

FUNDING COSTS, HIGHER LATE FEES, AN INCREASE IN INTERCHANGE REVENUE DUE TO

HIGHER PURCHASE VOLUMES AND SUCCESSFUL SALES OF FEE-BASED PRODUCTS. EXCLUDING

THE PROVIDIAN PORTFOLIO, OPERATING REVENUES INCREASED 12%. OPERATING EXPENSES

INCREASED 33%; EXCLUDING PROVIDIAN, OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 14%, DRIVEN

BY HIGHER VOLUMES AND AN INCREASE IN MARKETING EXPENDITURES, WHICH ENABLED

CCS TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF NEW CARDMEMBER ACQUISITIONS AMID A

COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT. TOTAL ACCOUNTS INCREASED 22%, REFLECTING THE

ADDITION OF 3.7 MILLION NEW ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS ACCOUNTS RELATED TO THE

CHASE AUTO FINANCE

CAF IS THE LARGEST U.S. BANK ORIGINATOR OF AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, WITH

MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION ACCOUNTS. IN 2002, CAF HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF AUTO

LOAN AND LEASE ORIGINATIONS, GROWING 28% OVER 2001 TO $25.4 BILLION. LOAN

AND LEASE RECEIVABLES OF $36.4 BILLION WERE 28% HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR

YEAR. OPERATING EARNINGS GREW 41% TO $180 MILLION. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED

HIGHER REVENUE ON INCREASES IN AVERAGE LOAN AND LEASE RECEIVABLES AND

LOWER FUNDING COSTS, OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND HIGHER CREDIT

COSTS DRIVEN BY LOAN VOLUMES.

IN 2002, CAFS OPERATING REVENUES GREW 26% TO $696 MILLION. ITS MARKET

SHARE AMONG AUTO FINANCE COMPANIES IMPROVED FROM 4.1% IN 2001 TO 5.7% IN

2002, THE RESULT OF STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH AND AN ORIGINATION STRATEGY THAT

ALLIES THE BUSINESS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS. CAF RELATIONSHIPS WITH

SEVERAL MAJOR CAR MANUFACTURERS CONTRIBUTED TO 2002 GROWTH, AS DID CAFS

DEALER RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 12,200 DEALERS IN

2001 TO APPROXIMATELY 12,700 DEALERS IN 2002. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED

THE SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE SECTOR INCLUDES ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY

SERVICES (ETS), CORPORATE BUSINESS SERVICES (CBS), LEGAL, AUDIT,

CORPORATE FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, RISK MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE

MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE MARKETING.

SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS REMAINING AT

THE CORPORATE LEVEL AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THESE POLICIES ALLOCATE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

ETS IS AN INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY SERVICE ORGANIZATION, AND CBS MANAGES THE FIRMS

SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FINANCE

OPERATIONS AND PROCUREMENT. ETS AND CBS SEEK TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPETITIVE WITH COMPARABLE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS IN TERMS

OF PRICE AND SERVICE QUALITY. THESE UNITS LEVERAGE THE FIRMS GLOBAL SCALE AND

TECHNOLOGY TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES THROUGH CONSOLIDATION, STANDARDIZATION, VENDOR

MANAGEMENT AND OUTSOURCING.

IN DECEMBER 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERED INTO A SEVEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH

IBM TO OUTSOURCE PORTIONS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

SERVICES. THIS AGREEMENT WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO TRANSFORM ITS TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH ABSOLUTE COST SAVINGS, INCREASED COST VARIABILITY,

ACCESS TO THE BEST RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AND IMPROVED SERVICE LEVELS. BY

MOVING FROM A TRADITIONAL FIXED-COST APPROACH TO ONE WITH INCREASED

CAPACITY AND COST VARIABILITY, THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE

QUICKLY TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE IMPACT ON EXPENSES AS A RESULT

OF THIS AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE MINIMAL IN 2003.

FOR 2002, SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE HAD AN

OPERATING LOSS

OF $743 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $649 MILLION IN 2001. THIS SECTOR USUALLY OPERATES AT

A MODERATE LOSS. NEGATIVE OPERATING REVENUE USUALLY RESULTS FROM THE

APPLICATION OF THE FIRMS TRANSFER PRICING POLICIES AND THE OVERALLOCATION OF

CAPITAL TO THE VARIOUS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. EXPENSE ITEMS USUALLY RESULT FROM

TIMING DIFFERENCES IN ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER BUSINESS SECTORS AND RESIDUALS

FROM INTEROFFICE ALLOCATION AMONG THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. INCOME TAX BENEFIT

REFLECTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE RECORDED AT THE CONSOLIDATED

LEVEL AND THE AMOUNT RECORDED AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. INCLUDED IN 2002

OPERATING EXPENSE WAS A $120 MILLION REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES;

THESE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FORFEITABLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS ISSUED

UNDER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS THAT CONTAINED STOCK PRICE TARGETS THAT WERE

DEEMED UNLIKELY TO BE ATTAINED WITHIN THE TIMEFRAMES SPECIFIED UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE AWARDS.

IN 2002, CREDIT COSTS IN EXCESS OF NET CHARGE-OFFS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE

SEGMENTS WERE $133 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $167 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS IN

2001. ALTHOUGH THE SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE SECTOR HAS NO TRADITIONAL

CREDIT ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

IS MAINTAINED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL AND IS NOT ALLOCATED TO ANY SPECIFIC

BUSINESS SEGMENT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT, SEE

PAGE 56.

INCLUDED IN THE 2001 OPERATING LOSSES OF $649 MILLION WAS A PRETAX LOSS OF

$152 MILLION AT LABMORGAN, RESULTING FROM THE WRITE-DOWNS OF INVESTMENTS

AND EQUITY ACCOUNTING LOSSES. LABMORGAN WAS RESTRUCTURED IN 2001, AND ITS

REMAINING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF $49 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, IS

MANAGED BY JPMORGAN PARTNERS.

THE NEGATIVE CAPITAL POSITION OF $1.8 BILLION IN SUPPORT UNITS AND

CORPORATE RESULTS FROM AN OVERALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL TO THE

BUSINESSES AS COMPARED WITH AVAILABLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT AT JPMORGAN CHASE IS GUIDED BY SEVERAL PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING.



DEFINED RISK GOVERNANCE



INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT



CONTINUAL EVALUATION OF RISK APPETITE, MANAGED THROUGH RISK LIMITS



PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION



RISK ASSESSMENT AND MEASUREMENT, INCLUDING VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO STRESS TESTING



PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT (SVA) THAT

ALLOCATES RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL TO BUSINESS

UNITS AND CHARGES A COST AGAINST THAT

CAPITAL

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT BEGINS

WITH THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH REVIEWS THE GOVERNANCE

OF THESE ACTIVITIES, DELEGATING THE FORMULATION OF POLICY AND

DAY-TODAY RISK OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

AND TO THE TWO CORPORATE RISK COMMITTEES: CAPITAL AND RISK

MANAGEMENT.

THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PROVIDES GUIDANCE REGARDING

STRATEGIES AND RISK APPETITE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN

INTEGRATED VIEW OF RISK EXPOSURES, INCLUDING THE

INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG JPMORGAN CHASES VARIOUS RISK

CATEGORIES.

THE

CAPITAL COMMITTEE

FOCUSES ON FIRM-WIDE CAPITAL PLANNING, INTERNAL

CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. THE

RISK MANAGEMENT

COMMITTEE

FOCUSES ON CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK,

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK AND FIDUCIARY RISK. BOTH RISK COMMITTEES HAVE

DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY, WITH MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS AND RISK

EXPOSURES SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCUSSION OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES TO

GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN.

IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

THE FIRMS USE OF SVA, WHICH INCORPORATES A RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL METHODOLOGY

AS ITS PRIMARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE, HAS STRENGTHENED ITS RISK MANAGEMENT

DISCIPLINE BY CHARGING THE BUSINESSES THE COST OF CAPITAL LINKED TO THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIVITIES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES, SEE THE RESPECTIVE

RISK MANAGEMENT SECTIONS ON PAGES 45-65.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL.

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES CAPITAL ADEQUACY UTILIZING

INTERNAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM ASSIGNS ECONOMIC CAPITAL

BASED PRIMARILY ON FOUR RISK FACTORS. THE METHODOLOGY QUANTIFIES CREDIT,

MARKET AND OPERATING RISK FOR EACH BUSINESS AND, FOR JPMP, PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK, AND ASSIGNS CAPITAL ACCORDINGLY. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE DISCUSSED IN

THE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTIONS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CAPITAL ALSO IS ASSESSED AGAINST BUSINESS UNITS FOR CERTAIN NONRISK

FACTORS. BUSINESSES ARE ASSESSED CAPITAL EQUAL TO 100% OF ANY GOODWILL AND

50% FOR CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLES GENERATED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES AN ASSET CAPITAL TAX AGAINST

MANAGED ASSETS AND SOME OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. THESE ASSESSMENTS

RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAIN MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS MUST BE

MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ESTIMATES THE PORTFOLIO EFFECT

ON REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL BASED ON CORRELATIONS OF RISK IN STRESS

SCENARIOS ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES. THIS ESTIMATED DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT

LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL FOR THE FIRM.

THE TOTAL REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AS DETERMINED BY

ITS MODELS AND AFTER CONSIDERING THE FIRMS ESTIMATED DIVERSIFICATION

BENEFITS IS THEN COMPARED WITH AVAILABLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY TO

EVALUATE OVERALL CAPITAL UTILIZATION. THE FIRMS POLICY IS TO MAINTAIN AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF EXCESS CAPITAL TO PROVIDE FOR GROWTH AND ADDITIONAL

PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES.

THE 2002 EXCESS CAPITAL POSITION WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2001. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

DUE TO THE LOWER CARRYING VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN CREDIT RISK CAPITAL AND GOODWILL/INTANGIBLES CAPITAL AT

CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF

THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST.

INTERNAL CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME TO REFLECT

REFINEMENTS OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL METHODOLOGIES. FOR 2003, THE FIRM IS

REVISING ITS CAPITAL MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK

AND OPERATING RISK. THESE CHANGES ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGES 57 AND 64.

REGULATORY CAPITAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD),

ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS AND

LEVERAGE RATIOS, FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

STATE-CHARTERED BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CHASE

MANHATTAN BANK USA, N.A. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AND ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED CAPITAL LEVELS WELL IN

EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

CURRENTLY, THE FIRM TARGETS A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8% TO 8.25%. THE

CAPITAL COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE FIRMS CAPITAL TARGETS AND POLICIES REGULARLY

IN LIGHT OF CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS NEEDS. ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS CAPITAL RATIOS AND A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 26

ON PAGES 99 AND 100.

DIVIDENDS.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN ANY QUARTER WILL BE DETERMINED BY JPMORGAN

CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXPRESSED ITS INTENT, ON

SEPTEMBER 17, 2002, TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT DIVIDEND LEVEL, PROVIDED THAT

CAPITAL RATIOS REMAIN STRONG AND EARNINGS PROSPECTS EXCEED THE CURRENT

DIVIDEND.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

IN MANAGING LIQUIDITY, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF LIQUIDITY RISK

MEASURES AS WELL AS MARKET CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, LIQUIDITY

NEEDS AND THE DESIRED MATURITY PROFILE OF ITS LIABILITIES.

OVERVIEW

LIQUIDITY RISK ARISES FROM THE GENERAL FUNDING NEEDS OF THE FIRMS

ACTIVITIES AND IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. JPMORGAN

CHASE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AS A KEY

FACTOR IN MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND UTILIZES A LIQUIDITY

FRAMEWORK INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS AND MINIMIZE FUNDING

COSTS. ACTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE

ABLE TO REPLACE MATURING OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND FUND ITS ASSETS AT

APPROPRIATE MATURITIES AND RATES IN ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE SETS THE OVERALL LIQUIDITY POLICY FOR THE FIRM AND

REVIEWS THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. IN ADDITION, THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE

PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

(SPES), WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

THAT THE FIRM MAY HAVE TO THOSE SPES. THE LIQUIDITY RISK COMMITTEE,

REPORTING TO THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE, MEETS MONTHLY TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR

LIQUIDITY ISSUES, PROVIDE POLICY GUIDANCE, OVERSEE ADHERENCE AND MAINTAIN

AN EVOLVING CONTINGENCY PLAN.

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LIQUIDITY MONITORING TOOLS TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE

LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY THROUGH NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

ANALYTICS RELY ON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT ABOUT JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO

LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR USE THEM AS COLLATERAL FOR BORROWINGS. THESE ANALYTICS

ALSO INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENTS HISTORICAL DATA ON THE FUNDING OF LOAN COMMITMENTS (E.G.,

COMMERCIAL PAPER BACK-UP FACILITIES), LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES,

COMMITMENTS WITH RATING TRIGGERS AND COLLATERAL-POSTING REQUIREMENTS. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON SPES AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, SEE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ON PAGE 44 AS WELL AS NOTE 11 ON PAGES

8387.

THE FIRMS THREE PRIMARY MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE.



HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM SURPLUS: MEASURES THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANYS ABILITY TO REPAY ALL OBLIGATIONS WITH A MATURITY UNDER ONE

YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BANKS TO PAY DIVIDENDS

TO THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IS CONSTRAINED.



CASH CAPITAL SURPLUS: MEASURES THE FIRMS ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON

A FULLY COLLATERALIZED BASIS, ASSUMING ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS

LOST.



BASIC SURPLUS: MEASURES JPMORGAN CHASE BANKS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN A

90-DAY STRESS EVENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRM WHERE NO NEW FUNDING

CAN BE RAISED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE.

EACH OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY SURPLUS POSITIONS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

INDICATES THAT JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED FUNDING, INCLUDING CORE DEPOSITS,

EXCEEDS ILLIQUID ASSETS AND THAT THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS CAN BE MET IF ACCESS TO

FUNDING IS TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

AN EXTENSION OF THE FIRMS ONGOING LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS ITS CONTINGENCY

FUNDING PLAN, WHICH IS INTENDED TO HELP THE FIRM MANAGE THROUGH LIQUIDITY

STRESS PERIODS. THE PLAN CONSIDERS TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS

AND FORECASTS POTENTIAL FUNDING NEEDS WHERE ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS

SEVERELY LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. THESE SCENARIOS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ON-

AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, EVALUATING ACCESS TO FUNDS BY THE PARENT

HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA, N.A.,

SEPARATELY.

FUNDING

CREDIT RATINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASES PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND JPMORGAN CHASE

AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2003, THE RATINGS OUTLOOK FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY

BY MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES (MOODYS) WAS STABLE, AND THE RATINGS

OUTLOOK FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY BY STANDARD & POORS (S&P) AND

FITCH, INC. (FITCH) WAS NEGATIVE.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT

RATINGS. DURING 2002, S&P, MOODYS AND FITCH LOWERED THE DEBT RATINGS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ONE NOTCH TO

THE LEVELS NOTED ABOVE. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE MARGINAL COST OF

LONG-TERM WHOLESALE FUNDS TO THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY. JPMORGAN CHASE

BANKS COST OF SHORT-TERM FUNDS HAS NOT BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE

DOWNGRADE, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES AND INVESTORS HAVE REDUCED LIMITS

AND MATURITIES OF EXPOSURE TO THE FIRM AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS. THE

FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FIRM HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL.

SEE PAGE 44, 52 AND NOTE 11 ON PAGE 86 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE

IMPLICATIONS OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE FOR THE FIRM.

BALANCE SHEET.

THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS INCREASED TO $759 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, FROM $694 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. AUTO FINANCING

AND RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER LOANS INCREASED ON HIGHER ORIGINATIONS, OFFSET BY

INCREASED LOAN SECURITIZATIONS; COMMERCIAL LOANS DECLINED, REFLECTING

WEAKER LOAN DEMAND AND THE FIRMS ONGOING EFFORTS TO REDUCE COMMERCIAL

EXPOSURES. INCREASES IN DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING ASSETS AND INVESTMENT

SECURITY ASSETS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASED TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITY.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN

INTEREST RATES. GROWTH IN TRADING ASSETS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES WAS

FINANCED PRIMARILY BY INCREASES IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, TRADING

LIABILITIES AND DEPOSITS.

SOURCES OF FUNDS.

THE DIVERSITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING SOURCES ENHANCES

FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON ANY ONE SOURCE OF FUNDS, WHILE

MINIMIZING THE COST OF FUNDS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING MARKETS

ACROSS THE GLOBE AND LEVERAGES A BROAD INVESTOR BASE. LIQUIDITY IS

GENERATED USING A VARIETY OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING DEPOSITS, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS,

COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK NOTES, MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM DEBT, CAPITAL

SECURITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM EXTENDED ITS

LIABILITY MATURITY PROFILE WHILE REDUCING RELIANCE ON SHORTER-DATED

WHOLESALE FUNDING INSTRUMENTS (E.G., FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER). A MAJOR SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS PROVIDED BY

ITS LARGE CORE DEPOSIT BASE. CORE DEPOSITS INCLUDE ALL U.S. DEPOSITS,

EXCEPT NONINTEREST-BEARING TIME DEPOSITS AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT OF

$100,000 OR MORE. IN ADDITION TO CORE DEPOSITS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM

SUBSTANTIAL, STABLE DEPOSIT BALANCES ORIGINATED BY T&SS THROUGH THE NORMAL

COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS

THE REPURCHASE AND ASSET SECURITIZATION MARKETS. THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE

EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SECURED

AND UNSECURED FUNDING. THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED

GAINS ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT

QUALITY AND YIELDS ON THE ASSETS SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY NOT

DEPENDENT ON THE RATINGS OF THE ISSUING ENTITY. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE

FIRM AND ITS SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THESE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDE RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTES 11 AND 29.

ISSUANCE.

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED IN 2002 ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND

SECTORS, DRIVEN BY HEADLINE RISK, INCREASED INVESTMENT-GRADE DEFAULTS AND

INVESTOR RISK AVERSION. JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREADS INCREASED RELATIVE

TO PEER COMMERCIAL BANK SPREADS BUT REMAINED COMPARABLE WITH PEER INVESTMENT

BANK SPREADS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THIS SECTION, THE FIRM

MAINTAINS FUNDING AT THE HOLDING COMPANY SUFFICIENT TO COVER MATURING

OBLIGATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH REQUIRES PERIODIC ISSUANCE OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL. THE FIRM RAISED THE MAJORITY OF ITS LIQUIDITY

NEEDS EARLIER IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE INCREASE IN COST OF FUNDING OCCURRED.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FROM THE INCREASED COST OF

LONG-TERM DEBT TO BE RAISED IN 2003 WILL NOT BE MATERIAL.

DURING 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $11 BILLION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT AND $1 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL SECURITIES. DURING THE YEAR,

$12.2 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURED OR WAS REDEEMED, AND $550 MILLION OF

PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY WAS REDEEMED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $7.2 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $9.4

BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS AND $3.4 BILLION OF AUTO LOANS, RESULTING IN

PRE-TAX GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $214 MILLION, $45 MILLION AND $6

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, SEE

NOTE 11 ON PAGES 83-87.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND FUNDING TO ACHIEVE THE

FIRMS DESIRED INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE. THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES

CONTRACTS TO SWAP FIXED-RATE DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS AND TO SWAP

FLOATING-RATE DEBT TO FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS. DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS ARE ALSO

USED TO HEDGE THE VARIABILITY IN INTEREST RATES THAT ARISES FROM OTHER

FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS THE

ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES OR SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES (SPVS) ARE AN

IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY

FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS.

SPES ARE NOT OPERATING ENTITIES; TYPICALLY THEY ARE SET UP FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE, HAVE A LIMITED LIFE, AND HAVE NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE

STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE BY SELLING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM

CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS, SPES CAN

BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE. THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING

OF MANY INVESTOR MARKETS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MARKET FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SPES IN THREE BROAD CATEGORIES OF

TRANSACTIONS: LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AND CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION. CAPITAL IS HELD, AS APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED

TRANSACTIONS AND EXPOSURES SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING

COMMITMENTS.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT AN SPE

TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE

CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS

POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH

WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS

WORLDWIDE RULES OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM

SELF-DEALING AND PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN

TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

INTEREST. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR

SPES, SEE NOTE 11 ON PAGES 83-87.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO

PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED

BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY A-1, P-1 AND F-1. THE AMOUNT OF THESE

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WAS $48.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002; $35.5 BILLION

RELATE TO THE FIRMS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOAN

VEHICLES FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 ON PAGE 86. THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL

PAPER OUTSTANDING FOR THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL

LOAN VEHICLES WAS $24.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE REMAINING $13.1

BILLION IN COMMITMENTS RELATE TO VEHICLES ESTABLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES. IF

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS,

THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER. ADDITIONALLY, FOR THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND THE STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES, JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE

SPE. ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS TOTAL $196.7

BILLION IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN NOTE 29 ON PAGES 102 AND 103.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

THIS RISK IS MANAGED AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

CREDIT RISK

CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS THE FIRM WOULD EXPERIENCE IF AN OBLIGOR

OR COUNTERPARTY COULD NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM IS

SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK IN ITS LENDING (E.G., LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS) AND IN ITS DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES.

THE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES USED IN THE

FIRMS CAPITAL MARKET ACTIVITIES IS MARKED-TO-MARKET, MEASURED AND

MANAGED THROUGH THE FIRMS MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.

THE CREDIT RISKS OF THE CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIOS ARE MARKEDLY

DIFFERENT. BROADLY SPEAKING, LOSSES ON CONSUMER EXPOSURES ARE MORE

PREDICTABLE, LESS VOLATILE AND LESS CYCLICAL THAN LOSSES ON COMMERCIAL

EXPOSURES. FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, THE ACTUAL LOSS VOLATILITY CAN

BE MUCH GREATER OVER THE COURSE OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT BEGINS WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF

DEFAULT AND THE RISK OF LOSS THAT COULD RESULT FROM AN OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM SEEKS TO ASSESS ALL CREDIT EXPOSURES,

WHETHER ON- OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE LOANS,

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS (E.G., LETTERS OF

CREDIT AND UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT). AT BOTH THE BUSINESS

UNIT AND CORPORATE LEVELS, PROCESSES IN PLACE ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT

CREDIT RISKS ARE ACCURATELY ASSESSED, PROPERLY APPROVED, CONTINUALLY

MONITORED AND ACTIVELY MANAGED.

TO MEASURE THESE RISKS, ESTIMATES ARE MADE OF BOTH EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR EACH SEGMENT OF THE PORTFOLIO USING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES.

FIRST, OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES ARE CONVERTED TO ON-BALANCE SHEET LOAN

EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS, BASED ON THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE DRAWN AT THE TIME

OF DEFAULT. THEN EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE CALCULATED. EXPECTED

LOSSES ARE STATISTICALLY-BASED ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER TIME,

ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. EXPECTED LOSSES ARE USED

TO SET RISK-ADJUSTED CREDIT LOSS PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, EXPECTED CREDIT

LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. FOR COMMERCIAL ASSETS, IF

LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE EXPECTED LOSS RATE COULD BE FACTORED

INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

UNEXPECTED LOSSES REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES

RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LEVEL OF LOSS. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE WHAT CREATE

RISK AND REPRESENT THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT RESIDES WITH TWO FUNCTIONS

THAT WERE INTEGRATED IN EARLY 2003: CREDIT RISK POLICY AND GLOBAL CREDIT

MANAGEMENT. BOTH ARE NOW HEADED BY THE SENIOR CREDIT OFFICER WHO, IN TURN,

REPORTS TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN FOR FINANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND

ADMINISTRATION.

CREDIT RISK POLICY FORMULATES CREDIT POLICIES, LIMITS, ALLOWANCE ADEQUACY

AND GUIDELINES. INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE GROUPS THAT APPROVE AND SUPPORT THE

FIRMS CREDIT ACTIVITIES, THIS GROUP MONITORS AND ASSESSES RISK PROFILES AND

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AT MULTIPLE LEVELS  INDIVIDUAL CREDITS, INDUSTRY

GROUPS, PRODUCT GROUPS AND ENTIRE BUSINESS SEGMENTS OF THE FIRM. CREDIT RISK

POLICY IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING PROBLEM CREDITS. CREDIT RISK POLICY

WORKS JOINTLY WITH MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TO ADDRESS COUNTRY RISK,

COUNTERPARTY RISK, RISK MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES.

GLOBAL CREDIT MANAGEMENT HAS THREE FUNCTIONS: CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT,

CORPORATE BANKING AND THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO GROUP. THE FIRST TWO FUNCTIONS

PARTICIPATE IN CLIENT COVERAGE AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING AND

MONITORING ALL CREDIT EXPOSURES. EXPERIENCED CREDIT OFFICERS MAKE DECISIONS

TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE COUNTERPARTYS

CREDITWORTHINESS AND THE TYPE OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENT. THESE OFFICERS CONSIDER

THE CURRENT AND PROJECTED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTERPARTY. ALSO

CONSIDERED ARE THE COVENANTS, COLLATERAL AND PROTECTION AVAILABLE SHOULD THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY DETERIORATE. AFTER CREDIT IS EXTENDED,

CREDIT OFFICERS AND INDUSTRY ANALYSTS, IN COLLABORATION WITH SENIOR BUSINESS

MANAGERS, MONITOR THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT QUALITY. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING

REVIEW OF COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL DATA AND DOCUMENTATION, THE CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE BANKING GROUPS MANAGE THE FORMAL CLIENT- AND

INDUSTRY-BASED PORTFOLIO REVIEW PROCESSES. SENIOR CREDIT OFFICERS REGULARLY

REVIEW CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE AND COMPLIANCE WITH LIMITS ON BOTH

INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND PORTFOLIOS. THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO GROUP MANAGES

THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM BOTH TRADITIONAL LENDING AND

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES.

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK BEGINS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT

SELECTION AND EVALUATION PROCESS. THE FIRM MONITORS AND EVALUATES INDUSTRY RISK

PROFILES GLOBALLY. EXPOSURES IN INDUSTRIES DEEMED TO HAVE INCREASING RISK ARE

MORE CLOSELY MANAGED, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRMS GLOBAL

STRATEGY, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS, IS TO FOCUS ON LARGE, LEADING FIRMS

WITH CROSS-BORDER FINANCING NEEDS.

CONCENTRATION MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BE KEY IN MANAGING COMMERCIAL CREDIT

RISK. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT,

CONCENTRATION MANAGEMENT IS ADDRESSED PARTLY BY THE FIRMS ESTABLISHED STRATEGY

OF LOAN ORIGINATION FOR DISTRIBUTION, AND PARTLY BY THE PURCHASE OF CREDIT

PROTECTION THROUGH CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND SECONDARY MARKET LOAN SALES. THE FIRM

MANAGES CONCENTRATIONS BY OBLIGOR, RISK RATING, INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND

GEOGRAPHY. AS A RESULT OF A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT IN 2002,

THE FIRM PLACED INCREASED EMPHASIS ON THE MANAGEMENT AND FURTHER REDUCTION OF

INDUSTRY AND SINGLE-NAME CONCENTRATIONS. THE FIRM ESTABLISHED AN EXPOSURE AND

CAPITAL THRESHOLD REVIEW PROCESS FOR SINGLE-NAME CONCENTRATIONS AND ENHANCED

ITS PROCEDURES TO REDUCE SINGLE-NAME AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS. THE FIRM WILL

CONTINUE TO REFINE THESE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES IN 2003.

THE FIRMS BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR ITS COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO REMAINS ONE OF

ORIGINATION FOR DISTRIBUTION, PRIMARILY FOR LARGE CORPORATE OBLIGORS. THE

MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE LOAN ORIGINATIONS IN IB CONTINUE TO BE

DISTRIBUTED INTO THE MARKETPLACE, WITH RESIDUAL HOLDS BY THE FIRM AVERAGING

LESS THAN 10%. THE COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO DECLINED 13% IN 2002, REFLECTING A

COMBINATION OF CONTINUED WEAK LOAN DEMAND AND CHARGE-OFFS, AS WELL AS THE

FIRMS ONGOING GOAL OF REDUCING COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRMS SVA DISCIPLINE DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF LOAN ASSETS THAT DO NOT

GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. SVA REMAINS

A CRITICAL DISCIPLINE IN MAKING LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN

COMBINED WITH OTHER CREDIT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES.

MARKETS FOR TRADITIONAL CREDIT PRODUCTS HAVE BECOME MORE LIQUID, WITH INCREASED

OPPORTUNITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND SECONDARY MARKET

LOAN SALES. THE FIRM WILL BEGIN IN 2003 TO DERIVE MORE OF ITS ASSESSMENT OF

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FROM THESE MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS WHICH WILL, IN TURN,

AFFECT SVA. SEE THE DISCUSSION ON CAPITAL ALLOCATION ON PAGE 57.

TOTAL COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE (LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS) WAS $413 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $424 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. AT YEAR-END 2002, 80% OF THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL CREDIT

EXPOSURE WAS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT-GRADE; ONLY 1% OF THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL

CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS NONPERFORMING. THIS COMPARES WITH 77% INVESTMENT-GRADE

EXPOSURE AT YEAR-END 2001; 0.8% OF THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS

NONPERFORMING AT THAT DATE.

TOTAL COMMERCIAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS WERE $4.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002

WHICH INCLUDED $337 MILLION RELATED TO ENRON. THIS REPRESENTED AN INCREASE OF

$772 MILLION FROM YEAR-END 2001 AND EQUALED 2% OF THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL

CREDIT-RELATED ASSETS. THE INCREASE IN NONPERFORMING ASSETS IN 2002 WAS LARGELY

DRIVEN BY LOANS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED, CABLE AND MERCHANT

ENERGY AND RELATED SECTORS. NONPERFORMING ASSETS RELATED TO ENRON DECLINED BY

$936 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE FIRMS LITIGATION

WITH THE SURETY PROVIDERS.

COMMERCIAL LOAN NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2002 WERE $1.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.0

BILLION IN 2001. CHARGE-OFFS OF COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE

$212 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH A NET RECOVERY OF $3 MILLION IN 2001. THE

CHARGE-OFF RATIO FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS WAS 1.93% IN 2002 AND 0.87% IN 2001.

WHILE THE ECONOMIC AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT ENVIRONMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN

CHALLENGING IN 2003, THE FIRM DOES NOT ANTICIPATE COMMERCIAL CHARGE-OFFS IN

2003 TO REACH 2002 LEVELS.

BELOW ARE SUMMARIES OF THE MATURITY AND RISK PROFILES OF THE COMMERCIAL

SELECTED INDUSTRY DISCUSSION



FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

 THIS GROUP OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDES COMMERCIAL

BANKING, FINANCE COMPANIES AND SECURITIES BROKERS, DEALERS AND EXCHANGES,

WHICH ARE TRADITIONALLY AMONG THE LARGEST INDUSTRY GROUPS. THE FIRM IS A

MARKET-LEADER IN STRUCTURING DERIVATIVES FOR AND LENDING TO THESE SECTORS.

IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED 54%

OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES IN ITS TRADING TRANSACTIONS.

COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE TO THIS GROUP OF INDUSTRIES CONTINUES TO BE

PREDOMINANTLY HIGH-INVESTMENT-GRADE. OF THE APPROXIMATELY $30 BILLION IN

AGGREGATE LIQUID COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AGAINST ALL ITS DERIVATIVES

CONTRACTS, APPROXIMATELY $18 BILLION SUPPORTS CONTRACTS WITH THE

COMMERCIAL BANKING INDUSTRY.



TELECOM AND RELATED INDUSTRIES

 IN 2002, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

CONSTRAINTS, AND THE FIRM SAW A CONCURRENT DETERIORATION IN THE RISK

PROFILE OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN THIS SECTOR, PARTICULARLY IN THE THIRD

QUARTER. THIS RESULTED IN EXPOSURES MIGRATING TO RISK RATINGS DEEMED BY

THE FIRM TO BE CRITICIZED, AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF NONPERFORMING LOANS AND

CHARGE-OFFS. DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM REDUCED ITS EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR

BY 18% AS A RESULT OF CHARGE-OFFS OF $909 MILLION AND BY $2.75 BILLION OF

SELECTIVE REDUCTIONS IN EXPOSURES. AT YEAR-END 2002, 56% OF THE FIRMS

EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR WAS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT-GRADE; 5% OF THE TOTAL

EXPOSURE WAS NONPERFORMING. THIS COMPARES WITH 55% INVESTMENT-GRADE

EXPOSURE AT YEAR-END 2001.



GENERAL MERCHANTS AND RETAILERS

 THE FIRMS LARGER EXPOSURES IN THIS

SEGMENT ARE TO INDUSTRY LEADERS. WHILE EXPOSURE INCREASED 35% IN 2002, THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY TO INVESTMENT-GRADE OBLIGORS, WITH 65% OF THE TOTAL

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT-GRADE AS OF YEAR-END 2002.



AUTOMOTIVE

 THE FIRM HAS HISTORICALLY VIEWED THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AS

CYCLICAL AND CAPITAL-INTENSIVE. IN 2001, AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES BEGAN TO

EXPERIENCE CYCLICAL PRESSURE, EXACERBATED BY THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001. HOWEVER, IN 2002, AUTO SALES REMAINED STRONG, AND THESE COMPANIES

TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO SUPPLEMENT LIQUIDITY AND

STRENGTHEN THEIR BALANCE SHEETS. WHILE TOTAL EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY IS

SIGNIFICANT, A MATERIAL PORTION OF THE EXPOSURE IS TO THE LARGEST

AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES AND IS 80% UNDRAWN. THIS PORTFOLIO WAS 71%

INVESTMENT-GRADE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.



MERCHANT ENERGY AND RELATED INDUSTRIES

 THE FIRM EXPERIENCED AN

ACCELERATION IN CRITICIZED LOANS IN THE MERCHANT ENERGY SECTOR BEGINNING

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 AND ACCELERATING INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE

FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN NONPERFORMING LOANS IN THIS SECTOR IN

2003. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, CREDIT EXPOSURE IN THIS SECTOR WAS $6.2

BILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY 1.5% OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE), WITH

57% INVESTMENT-GRADE.



CABLE

 THE CABLE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, WAS ALSO ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY SEVERE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS IN 2002. AS A RESULT,

THERE WAS A CONCURRENT DETERIORATION IN THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS

CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN THIS SECTOR, EVIDENCED BY AN INCREASE IN EXPOSURE

FINANCIAL DETERIORATION. IN RESPONSE, THE FIRM REDUCED, AND INCREASINGLY

COLLATERALIZED, ITS EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR. CREDIT EXPOSURE TO THIS

EXPOSURE TO THE SECTOR. THIS GROUP INCLUDES TRUSTS AND ESTATES, AS WELL AS

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES PROVIDING SECURED FINANCING OF ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE ORIGINATED BY COMPANIES IN A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES. THE

REMAINING $170 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE IS WELL DIVERSIFIED ACROSS OVER

50 OTHER INDUSTRIES, WITH NONE COMPRISING MORE THAN 2% OF EXPOSURE; 74% OF

THE $170 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS INVESTMENT-GRADE AT DECEMBER 31,

CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

EXPOSURES DEEMED CRITICIZED GENERALLY REPRESENT A RISK PROFILE SIMILAR TO A

RATING OF CCC+/CAA1 OR LOWER. OF THE TOTAL $16.6 BILLION IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE

AS OF YEAR-END 2002, REPRESENTING 4% OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE, $4.1

BILLION WAS NON-PERFORMING. THE TELECOM AND RELATED, CABLE AND MERCHANT ENERGY

AND RELATED SECTORS REPRESENTED, IN THE AGGREGATE, $6.8 BILLION, OR 41%, OF

TOTAL CRITICIZED EXPOSURE, BUT ONLY 1.6% OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

THE BALANCE OF THE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE REPRESENTED EXPOSURES DIVERSIFIED ACROSS

A LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, WITH LIMITED INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION.

ENRON-RELATED EXPOSURE

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ENRON AND ENRON-RELATED ENTITIES WAS REDUCED BY $1.38

BILLION DURING 2002, FROM $2.06 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO $688 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN JANUARY 2003, THE FIRM SETTLED ITS SURETY-BOND LITIGATION

WITH 11 INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR 60% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND

RECEIVED A CASH PAYMENT OF $502 MILLION AND UNSECURED CLAIMS VALUED AT $75

MILLION (OR 13% OF FACE VALUE). IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM

CHARGED OFF AN AGGREGATE $395 MILLION RELATING TO THE REMAINING EXPOSURE ON THE

PREPAID FORWARD CONTRACTS AND ON A PREPAID FORWARD CONTRACT THAT IS BACKED BY A

LETTER OF CREDIT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CONTINUING LITIGATION. THE FIRM HAS

RECLASSIFIED THE REMAINING VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS COVERED BY THE

SURETY BONDS AND THE $75 MILLION IN UNSECURED CLAIMS AS TRADING ASSETS. IN

ADDITION TO THESE WRITE-DOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS, DURING 2002, $76 MILLION OF

OTHER ENRON-RELATED EXPOSURE WAS CHARGED-OFF OR WRITTEN-DOWN AND $402 MILLION

OF ENRON-RELATED ASSETS WERE SOLD OR MATURED, INCLUDING $125 MILLION OF

DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING EXPOSURE WHICH MATURED WITHOUT BEING DRAWN.

ASSETS (BOTH PERFORMING AND NONPERFORMING) ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. SECURED

LOANS ARE PERFORMING AND ARE REPORTED ON AN AMORTIZED COST BASIS. ALL UNSECURED

AMOUNTS ARE NONPERFORMING; NONPERFORMING LOANS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN TO

REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF CURRENT RECOVERABLE VALUE, AND NONPERFORMING

OTHER ASSETS ARE BEING CARRIED AT THEIR CURRENT ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 5.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO

MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH TRADING ACTIVITIES,

MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST AND CURRENCY RATES AND MANAGE ITS

OWN CREDIT RISK. THE FIRM USES THE SAME CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES TO

ASSESS AND APPROVE POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURES WHEN ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS AS THOSE USED FOR TRADITIONAL LENDING.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES (I.E., THE MARK-TO-MARKET OR FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT

J.P. MORGAN

CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

THE $26 TRILLION OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE POSSIBLE CREDIT

LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS. FOR MOST DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE HANDS; IT IS SIMPLY

USED AS A REFERENCE TO CALCULATE PAYMENTS. IN TERMS OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK

EXPOSURE, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RISK IS THE MARK-TO-MARKET (MTM) VALUE

OF THE CONTRACT. THE MTM EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE COST TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS

AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS MORE THAN ONE TRANSACTION OUTSTANDING WITH A COUNTERPARTY, AND A LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MTM

EXPOSURE, LESS COLLATERAL HELD, REPRESENTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE

MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE MTM VALUE OF DERIVATIVES RECEIVABLES (AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS) WAS $83 BILLION.

FURTHER, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT $30 BILLION OF COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM,

THE NET CURRENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS $53 BILLION.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVES RECEIVABLE DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF

THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE, THE FIRM MEASURES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, BOTH THE WORST-CASE,

OR PEAK, FUTURE CREDIT RISK (AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL), AS WELL AS THE

EXPECTED CREDIT RISK. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT RISK EMBEDDED

IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL PEAK OR

EXPECTED CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE, AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, CREDIT

RISK IS REDUCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH

SEPARATE COUNTERPARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO TRADES CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS

EVEN IF BOTH COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIRM REFERS TO

THIS EFFECT AS MARKET DIVERSIFICATION.

THE FIRM DEFINES THE MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK AS THE MAXIMUM LOSS (ESTIMATED

AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL) THAT WOULD OCCUR IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO

DEFAULT OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON WITHOUT ANY RECOVERY. THE

MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH COLLATERAL AND NETTING,

WAS APPROXIMATELY $57 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. SINCE, GENERALLY, ALL

COUNTERPARTIES WILL NOT DEFAULT AT ONCE NOR ALL DEFAULT WHEN THEIR EXPOSURES

ARE AT PEAK LEVELS, THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE MEASURE, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, OF ITS

POTENTIAL FUTURE DERIVATIVES CREDIT RISK.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THIS IS CALLED THE CREDIT

VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) AND WAS $1.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

COMPARED WITH $1.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE

EXPECTED FUTURE EXPOSURE (INCORPORATING NETTING AND COLLATERAL) TO A

COUNTERPARTY, AND ON THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES

MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL

ACTIVITY, DEAL UNWINDS AND CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE, EQUITY, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OR COMMODITY ENVIRONMENT. THE CVA INCREASE IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, WHICH INCREASED AS A RESULT OF A DROP IN U.S.

INTEREST RATES, INCREASED INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY AND WIDENING OF CREDIT

SPREADS DURING THE YEAR.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE

CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM HEDGES COMPONENTS OF THE CVA

CHANGE BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS WHEN

CLIENT DEALS ARE ORIGINATED. THESE HEDGES ARE REBALANCED AS MARKET CONDITIONS

DICTATE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CHANGES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES CREDIT QUALITY. IF

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK INCREASES, THE CVA INCREASES TO REFLECT THE INCREASED

LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CLIENT WILL NOT PERFORM. CORRESPONDINGLY, THE REQUIRED

MARKET HEDGES TO PROTECT AGAINST SUBSEQUENT CREDIT-QUALITY DETERIORATION

INCREASE. THE NET IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN CVA, PLUS THE RESULT OF ALL FORMS OF

RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITY, IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN TRADING REVENUE AND WAS NOT

MATERIAL TO THE OVERALL TRADING RESULTS OF THE FIRM FOR THE YEAR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 52% OF THE FIRMS COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS WERE INVESTMENT-GRADE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE

DEALERS IN THESE PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENT-GRADE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES WAS 87% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. NONPERFORMING DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE $289 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2001. THIS DECREASE OF $1.0 BILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF

THE ENRON SURETY LITIGATION.

AGAINST THIS EXPOSURE WERE $83 BILLION AND $30 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE $30

INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS; THIS COLLATERAL SECURES EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE

IN THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF DERIVATIVES SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS

TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. THE $30 BILLION ALSO EXCLUDES CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY RECEIVABLES.

APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS HAVE ASSOCIATED

COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERALIZATION AS A PRIMARY FORM OF CREDIT RISK

MITIGATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE. THE FIRM HELD $30 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $20 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. THE FIRM

POSTED $19 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AT YEAR-END 2002, COMPARED WITH $11 BILLION AT

THE END OF 2001. THE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE DROP IN U.S. INTEREST

RATES AND BY NEW COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE BOTH THE FIRM AND THE COUNTERPARTY,

UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST

COLLATERAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. THE IMPACT ON REQUIRED

COLLATERAL OF A SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK FROM ITS

CURRENT RATING OF AA- TO A+ WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADDITIONAL $1.2 BILLION OF

COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE

TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (FROM AA- TO BBB-) WOULD HAVE BEEN $3.7 BILLION OF

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM CURRENT LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE AMOUNT

OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIRED UPON DOWNGRADE MOVES IN TANDEM WITH THE

MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO AND RANGED FROM $2.6 BILLION

TO $3.8 BILLION THROUGH 2002 (RELATED TO A SIX-NOTCH DOWNGRADE), AS THE LEVEL

OF U.S. INTEREST RATES CHANGED. MOREOVER, CERTAIN DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE

CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON JPMORGAN CHASE BANK BEING DOWNGRADED, AT THE

THEN-EXISTING MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS LIMITED COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE AS A RESULT OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS. OF THE $83 BILLION OF TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION, OR 7%, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. THE USE OF DERIVATIVES TO

MANAGE EXPOSURES DOES NOT REDUCE THE REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE

SHEET OR THE LEVEL OF REPORTED OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS COMPOSED OF CREDIT EXPOSURES TO

CLIENTS ARISING FROM BOTH LENDING AND DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES. IN MANAGING THIS

PORTFOLIO, SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE PURCHASED BY THE

CREDIT PORTFOLIO GROUP TO HEDGE THESE EXPOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

NOTIONAL OUTSTANDING OF PROTECTION PURCHASED VIA SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO

CREDIT DERIVATIVES WAS $24 BILLION AND $10 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ALSO

DIVERSIFIES ITS EXPOSURES BY PROVIDING (I.E., SELLING) SMALL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT

PROTECTION, WHICH INCREASES EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIES OR CLIENTS WHERE THE FIRM

HAS LITTLE OR NO CLIENT-RELATED EXPOSURE. THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE

FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE, AND CREDIT PROTECTION SOLD TOTALED LESS THAN

TRADING REVENUE, WHEREAS THE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BEING HEDGED

IN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CAUSES EARNINGS VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT

EXPOSURES. THE MARK-TO-MARKET TREATMENT OF BOTH THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES HEDGES

(SHORT CREDIT POSITIONS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (LONG CREDIT

POSITIONS) PROVIDE SOME NATURAL OFFSET OF EACH OTHER. INCLUDED IN TRADING

REVENUE ARE GAINS OF $127 MILLION IN 2002 RELATED TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT

WERE USED TO HEDGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE. OF THE $127 MILLION,

APPROXIMATELY $94 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE

ACCRUAL LENDING ACTIVITIES. TRADING REVENUES INCORPORATE BOTH THE COST OF HEDGE

PREMIUMS AND CHANGES IN VALUE DUE TO SPREAD MOVEMENTS AND CREDIT EVENTS.

DEALER/CLIENT ACTIVITY

JPMORGAN CHASES DEALER ACTIVITY IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS CLIENT-DRIVEN. THE

BUSINESS ACTS AS A MARKET MAKER IN SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND ALSO

STRUCTURES MORE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS FOR CLIENTS INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES. THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES TRADING FUNCTION OPERATES WITHIN THE SAME

FRAMEWORK AS OTHER MARKET-MAKING DESKS. RISK LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED AND CLOSELY

MONITORED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND

SOLD BY THE DEALER BUSINESS WERE $159 BILLION AND $172 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THESE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRM SELLING

PROTECTION ON LARGE, DIVERSIFIED, PREDOMINANTLY INVESTMENT-GRADE PORTFOLIOS

(INCLUDING THE MOST SENIOR TRANCHES), AND THEN HEDGING THESE POSITIONS BY

BUYING PROTECTION ON THE MORE SUBORDINATED TRANCHES OF THE SAME PORTFOLIOS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY USE SECURITIES TO HEDGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE THERE IS A MISMATCH IN NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES, THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED. THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK

CONTRIBUTED BY THE FIRMS CREDIT DERIVATIVES DEALER ACTIVITY IS IMMATERIAL IN

THE CONTEXT OF JPMORGAN CHASES OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURES.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING ITS COUNTRY

EXPOSURES AND RISK. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING,

TRADING AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS JPMORGAN CHASES EXPOSURE TO SELECTED COUNTRIES. THIS

DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS

ARE ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G., GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT)

PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES LOCATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY IF THE ENHANCEMENTS FULLY

COVER THE COUNTRY RISK, AS WELL AS THE COMMERCIAL RISK. TOTAL EXPOSURE INCLUDES

EXPOSURE TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY.

WHILE EXPOSURE TO MEXICO FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF TRADING ACTIVITIES, THE

DECREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN MATURITIES AND

REDUCTIONS IN COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVES. THE DECREASE IN EXPOSURE TO

BRAZIL OVER THE PRIOR YEAR-END WAS DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN LOANS AND DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRADING POSITIONS.

REDUCTIONS IN ARGENTINA WERE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF MATURITIES AND

WRITE-DOWNS. EXPOSURE TO VENEZUELA INCREASED MODESTLY AS A RESULT OF TRADING

POSITIONS.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT USES SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT

SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. RISK PARAMETERS ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COST OF CREDIT RISK IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF PRODUCT

PRICING AND EVALUATING PROFIT DYNAMICS. CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS ARE MONITORED TO

IDENTIFY DEVIATIONS FROM EXPECTED PERFORMANCE AND SHIFTS IN PATTERNS OF

CONSUMER BEHAVIOR.

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF MORTGAGES, CREDIT

CARDS AND AUTO FINANCINGS. THIS PORTFOLIO IS PREDOMINANTLY U.S.-BASED AND

CONTINUES TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY WELL-DIVERSIFIED. THE FIRMS MANAGED CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO TOTALED $156 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN INCREASE OF $22

BILLION, OR 16%, FROM 2001. THE PIE GRAPH TO THE RIGHT PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF

LOANS FOR 14 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES INCREASED 8% DURING 2002 ON

INCREASED ORIGINATIONS. WHILE NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR 2002 INCREASED $6 MILLION, OR

12%, OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, THE 2002 NET CHARGE-OFF RATE REMAINED LOW AT 0.10%,

REFLECTING THE CONTINUED STRONG CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER

31, 2002, THE FIRM HAD $1.8 BILLION OF SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, OF

WHICH $1.3 BILLION WERE HELD FOR SALE.

THE FIRM ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH

INCLUDES CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

SECURITIZED. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INCREASED BY $9.6 BILLION, OR 23%

DURING 2002. APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION OF THIS GROWTH AROSE FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST IN FEBRUARY 2002. THE MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFF RATIO OF 5.87% WAS 42 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN IN 2001. THE INCREASE

IN THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY LEVELS AS

WELL AS HIGHER CONTRACTUAL LOSSES (I.E., LOSSES ON ACCOUNTS NOT BANKRUPT), DUE,

IN LARGE PART, TO THE CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROVIDIAN PORTFOLIO; THESE

LOSSES WERE THEREFORE ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME OF THE PORTFOLIO ACQUISITION.

AUTO FINANCE RECEIVABLES GREW BY 31% TO APPROXIMATELY $34 BILLION, WHILE THE

NET CHARGE-OFF RATE IMPROVED SLIGHTLY FROM 0.59% TO 0.57% IN 2002.

IN THE CONSUMER SECTOR, THE FIRM CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS IN

2003 RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN LOANS OUTSTANDING; CHARGE-OFF RATES ARE

ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR TO THOSE EXPERIENCED IN 2002.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE

CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST

QUARTERLY, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED BASED ON THAT REVIEW IF,

IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE INCLUDES

SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS AND A RESIDUAL COMPONENT. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 6566 AND NOTE 10 ON PAGE 82.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE

ADEQUATE TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT CURRENTLY MAY EXIST BUT ARE NOT YET

IDENTIFIABLE.

LOANS

THE COMMERCIAL SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $1.60 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN INCREASE OF $547 MILLION, OR 52%, FROM YEAR-END 2001. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DETERIORATION IN COMMERCIAL LOANS

RELATED TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED INDUSTRIES AND CABLE SECTORS,

WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN CRITICIZED AND NONPERFORMING LOANS.

THE COMMERCIAL EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $613 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, A DECREASE OF $55 MILLION, OR 8%, FROM YEAR-END 2001. THE

DECREASE REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT, AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE AVERAGE

QUALITY, OF THE NONCRITICIZED PORTION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

THE CONSUMER EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $2.36 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN INCREASE OF $255 MILLION, OR 12%, FROM YEAR-END 2001. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE PROVIDIAN

PORTFOLIO BY CARDMEMBER SERVICES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF RETAINED CREDIT CARD LOANS (EXCLUDING THOSE IN THE

PROVIDIAN PORTFOLIO) AND A REDUCTION IN EXPECTED LOSS RATES IN THE AUTO FINANCE

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED DELINQUENCY RATES.

THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $774 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

AN INCREASE OF $79 MILLION, OR 11%, FROM YEAR-END 2001. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

RESIDUAL COMPONENT AS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

PRIMARILY IN THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE RESIDUAL

COMPONENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 14% OF THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

WITHIN THE FIRMS TARGET RANGE OF BETWEEN 10% AND 20%.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE CREDIT-EXTENSION PROCESS,

MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS AS WELL AS A

RESIDUAL COMPONENT FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THIS IS COMPUTED USING A

METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED

MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN. THE ALLOWANCE INCREASED DUE TO

DETERIORATION IN THE CRITICIZED PORTION OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. IN 2002, THE FIRM CHARGED-OFF $212 MILLION OF A LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENT TO ONE OBLIGOR IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED INDUSTRY

SEGMENT.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR CREDIT RISK

UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES DRIVE THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL BY

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT. IN THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS ARE

DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING, LOSS SEVERITY, MATURITY AND CORRELATIONS. WITHIN

THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES, CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY PRODUCT AND

BY PRODUCT SEGMENT.

FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, THE FIRM IN 2003 WILL BEGIN ALIGNING ITS

ASSESSMENT OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO CORRESPOND MORE CLOSELY TO MARKET

CONDITIONS, BOTH AT THE TIME OF THE CREDIT EXTENSION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

THIS IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE RISK MANAGEMENT, BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

GROWING MARKET IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND SECONDARY MARKET LOAN SALES, AND TO

ENCOURAGE EARLIER ACTION IN THE EVENT OF MARKET DETERIORATION. IN DETERMINING

THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL THAT SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT

EXPOSURES, THE FIRM WILL EMPHASIZE CURRENT, MARKET-BASED ESTIMATES OF DEFAULT

LIKELIHOOD AND CREDIT DETERIORATION IMPLIED FROM CREDIT SPREADS AND EQUITY

PRICES, RATHER THAN HISTORICAL AVERAGES. CONCURRENTLY, THE FIRM WILL ASSESS THE

VALUATION IMPACT OF CREDIT DETERIORATION AS WELL AS ANTICIPATED LOSSES

ASSOCIATED WITH DEFAULT.

DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, THE ASSESSMENT OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS

EXPECTED TO VARY WITH CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS IN THE MARKET. THE NEW

METHODOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL ALLOCATED

TO THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO. THIS EXPECTED INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK CAPITAL WILL

BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY METHODOLOGY CHANGES TO OPERATING RISK CAPITAL (SEE THE

DISCUSSION ON CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISK ON PAGE 64).

THE FIRM WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO REFINE IN 2003 ITS PROCESSES FOR ESTABLISHING

CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR INDUSTRY AND SINGLE-NAME CONCENTRATIONS, INCLUDING

INVESTMENT-GRADE OBLIGORS.

FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE PLACED INTO CATEGORIES WITH

HOMOGENOUS CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS, FROM WHICH DEFAULT RATES AND CHARGE-OFFS CAN

BE ESTIMATED. THE CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO BE ALLOCATED IS BASED ON THE

UNEXPECTED LOSS INHERENT IN THOSE SEGMENTS.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL

REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY MOVEMENTS IN MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND

FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, AND EQUITY AND COMMODITY PRICES.

JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYS COMPREHENSIVE, RIGOROUS PROCESSES INTENDED TO MEASURE,

MONITOR, AND CONTROL MARKET RISK.

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT IS AN INDEPENDENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FUNCTION THAT

IDENTIFIES, MEASURES, MONITORS AND CONTROLS MARKET RISK. IT SEEKS TO FACILITATE

EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS AND TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING

PERFORMANCE BY MAKING THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN FOR FINANCE, RISK

MANAGEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION. WITHIN THE GROUP, INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE TEAMS ARE

ASSIGNED TO PARTICULAR BUSINESSES AND HAVE EXPERTISE IN THE TYPES OF RISK

SPECIFIC TO THOSE BUSINESSES. EACH TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING,

MONITORING, AND CONTROLLING MARKET RISK FOR ITS BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE TEAMS, TWO GROUPS ARE MANAGED UNDER A JOINT MANDATE

WITH CREDIT RISK POLICY. ONE GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COUNTRY RISK AND

COUNTERPARTY RISK. THE SECOND GROUP DEVELOPS THE METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING

RISK AND ALLOCATING MARKET AND CREDIT RISK CAPITAL THROUGHOUT THE FIRM.

FINALLY, THE POLICY REPORTING AND ANALYSIS GROUP WITHIN MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE POLICIES THAT CONTROL THE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND FOR AGGREGATING, INTERPRETING, AND DISTRIBUTING MARKET

RISK-RELATED INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE FIRM.

THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS REPORTING TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN WITH SOME RESPONSIBILITY

FOR MANAGING MARKET RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA, THE VALUATION

CONTROL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF ALL

POSITIONS TAKEN WITHIN IB.

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK IS NOT, HOWEVER, CONFINED TO A CENTRAL ORGANIZATION.

BUSINESS UNITS ARE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG RISK DISCIPLINE AT ALL LEVELS.

TRADING BUSINESSES, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM

TRADING PERSONNEL AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK EXPOSURES TAKEN WITHIN

THEIR BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, BUSINESSES ARE EXPECTED TO REPORT EXPOSURES

WHICH MAY BE UNUSUALLY LARGE OR MAY NOT FIT EXISTING RISK MEASUREMENT

METHODOLOGIES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES

SEVERAL MEASURES, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



STATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTS



NET INTEREST INCOME STRESS TESTS



OTHER MEASURES OF POSITION SIZE AND SENSITIVITY TO MARKET MOVES

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, VAR, GAUGES THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND

PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF

RISK DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED TO COMPARE RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES, TO

MONITOR LIMITS AND TO ALLOCATE ECONOMIC CAPITAL. IN A NORMAL TRADING

ENVIRONMENT, VAR PROVIDES RISK TRANSPARENCY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS

HEADS, REGULATORS AND INVESTORS.

EACH BUSINESS DAY, THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT

INCLUDES ITS TRADING, INVESTMENT, AND ASSET/LIABILITY (A/L) MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES. JPMORGAN CHASES VAR CALCULATION IS HIGHLY GRANULAR, COMPRISING

MORE THAN 500,000 POSITIONS AND 200,000 PRICING SERIES (E.G., SECURITIES

PRICES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RATES). FOR A LARGE PORTION OF ITS

EXPOSURE, THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED FULL-REVALUATION VAR, WHICH, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES, GENERATES MORE ACCURATE RESULTS.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES RISK

ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT, COMPARABLE WAY. THIS

APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

FUTURE CHANGES. THE SIMULATION IS BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS.

KEY TERMS.



VAR: WORST-CASE LOSS EXPECTED WITHIN THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL; WHILE LARGER

LOSSES ARE POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE A CORRESPONDINGLY LOW PROBABILITY OF

ACTUALLY OCCURRING



FULL-REVALUATION VAR: METHOD THAT PRICES EACH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

SEPARATELY, BASED ON THE ACTUAL PRICING MODELS USED BY THE LINES OF

BUSINESS; COMPARED WITH SENSITIVITY-BASED VAR, WHICH ONLY APPROXIMATES THE

IMPACT OF MARKET MOVES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT PRICES



BACK-TESTING: VALIDATING A MODEL BY COMPARING ITS PREDICTIONS WITH ACTUAL

RESULTS



CONFIDENCE LEVEL: THE PROBABILITY THAT ACTUAL LOSSES WILL NOT EXCEED

ESTIMATED VAR; THE GREATER THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THE HIGHER THE VAR

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

58

ALL STATISTICAL MODELS INVOLVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, DEPENDING ON THE

ASSUMPTIONS THEY EMPLOY. THE FIRM PREFERS HISTORICAL SIMULATION BECAUSE IT

INVOLVES FEWER ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PORTFOLIO LOSSES THAN

PARAMETER-BASED METHODOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM REGULARLY ASSESSES THE

QUALITY OF THE MARKET DATA, SINCE THEIR ACCURACY IS CRITICAL TO COMPUTING VAR.

NEVERTHELESS, TO THE EXTENT THAT VAR IS LARGELY BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET

DATA, IT MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT FUTURE RISK DURING ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH

MARKET VOLATILITY IS CHANGING. IN ADDITION, THE VAR MEASURE ON ANY PARTICULAR

DAY IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RISK LEVELS, SINCE POSITIONS AND MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY BOTH CHANGE OVER TIME.

NM-

BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DIFFERENT

RISK COMPONENTS, IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION

EFFECT. IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASES AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END

VARS ARE LESS THAN

THE SUM OF THE VARS OF ITS MARKET RISK COMPONENTS DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING

FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION.

THE FIRM CALCULATED THE VAR NUMBERS REPORTED ABOVE USING A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON

AND A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES

GREATER THAN PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS, OR

ABOUT 2.5 TIMES A YEAR. IN 2002, THERE WERE NO DAYS ON WHICH ACTUAL FIRM-WIDE

MARKET RISK-RELATED LOSSES EXCEEDED CORPORATE VAR, A RESULT WHICH DOES NOT

DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

ALTHOUGH NO SINGLE RISK STATISTIC CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE

TABLE ABOVE PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL OVERVIEW OF THE FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

ARISING FROM TRADING ACTIVITIES AND THE INVESTMENT AND A/L PORTFOLIOS. VARS FOR

THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A/L ACTIVITIES MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL

CHANGE IN THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT MEASURES OF REPORTED

REVENUES SINCE THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MARKED-TO-MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

THE DAILY AVERAGE TRADING VAR FOR THE 12 MONTHS OF 2002 WAS $71.6 MILLION. THE

LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR WAS INTEREST RATE RISK, WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT SPREAD RISK;

BEFORE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION, INTEREST RATE RISK ACCOUNTED FOR ROUGHLY

TWO-THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE VAR. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT, WHICH AVERAGED

$(28.9) MILLION IN 2002, REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE LARGEST LOSSES FOR

DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND RISKS DO NOT TYPICALLY OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME. THE RISK

OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE RISKS

OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES. THE DEGREE OF DIVERSIFICATION IS DETERMINED BOTH

BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT MARKET VARIABLES TEND TO MOVE TOGETHER, AND BY

THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT BUSINESSES HAVE SIMILAR POSITIONS.

THE REDUCTION IN TRADING VAR BETWEEN YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001 WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY DECLINES IN MARKET VOLATILITIES, PARTICULARLY IN INTEREST RATES

AND ENERGY PRICES. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS TRADING POSITIONS CHANGE AND MARKET VOLATILITY

FLUCTUATES.

THE HISTOGRAM ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE ILLUSTRATES THE FIRMS DAILY MARKET

RISK-RELATED REVENUE, DEFINED AS THE DAILY CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE

MARK-TO-MARKET TRADING PORTFOLIOS PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME,

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE. THE CHART SHOWS THAT

THE FIRM POSTED POSITIVE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE FOR 226 OUT OF 258

DAYS IN 2002, WITH 63 DAYS EXCEEDING $50 MILLION. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 32

OF THE 258 DAYS; 17 OF THOSE DAYS WERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. POOR OVERALL

TRADING RESULTS IN THAT QUARTER ACCOUNTED FOR THE LOSSES DURING THOSE 17 DAYS.

NO DAILY TRADING LOSS DURING THE YEAR WAS IN EXCESS OF $64 MILLION.

THE WEAKEST PERFORMANCE OCCURRED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, WHEN IT AVERAGED

$18.0 MILLION. THIS LOWER REVENUE WAS NOT DUE TO GENERALLY INCREASED RISK TAKEN

DURING THE QUARTER, BUT RATHER REFLECTED THE OUTCOME OF SPECIFIC POSITIONING

DECISIONS. PERFORMANCE IMPROVED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, AS AVERAGE DAILY

MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE INCREASED TO $33.6 MILLION, WHILE THE AVERAGE VAR

REMAINED SLIGHTLY BELOW THE AVERAGE FOR ALL OF 2002. THUS, THE IMPROVEMENT IN

MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY

AN OVERALL INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF RISK TAKEN.

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY

BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS, BASED ON DAILY MARKET

RISK-RELATED REVENUE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASLE

COMMITTEES MARKET RISK CAPITAL RULES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS GUIDELINES

STATE THAT SUCH REVENUE TYPICALLY INCLUDES FEE INCOME AND COMMISSIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES, IN ADDITION TO REALIZED AND UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON PORTFOLIO POSITIONS. THE INSET EXAMINES THE 32 DAYS ON

WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE POSTED TRADING LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR

WAS GREATER THAN THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH DAY. NO LOSSES EXCEEDED VAR ON ANY OF

THESE DAYS, A PERFORMANCE STATISTICALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS 99%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO UNLIKELY EVENTS IN NORMAL MARKETS,

STRESS TESTING CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN

ABNORMAL MARKETS. STRESS TESTING IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS VAR IN MEASURING AND

CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK

PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL AND IS USED FOR LIMITS MONITORING, CROSS-BUSINESS

RISK MEASUREMENT AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION.

THE FIRM STRESS TESTS ITS PORTFOLIOS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH, AT BOTH THE

CORPORATE AND BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVELS, USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS. SCENARIOS ARE

CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE

AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. STRESS RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED EACH

MONTH TO THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO HELP THEM BETTER MEASURE AND MANAGE

RISKS TO UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

APPLYING ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS TO THE TRADING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS

AND A/L ACTIVITIES HELPS THE FIRM UNDERSTAND HOW THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS

BALANCE SHEET (NOT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER GAAP) WOULD CHANGE UNDER CERTAIN

SCENARIOS.

THE FIRMS STRESS-TEST METHODOLOGY ASSUMES THAT, DURING AN ACTUAL STRESS EVENT,

NO ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN TO CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE OF PORTFOLIOS. THIS

CAPTURES THE DECREASED LIQUIDITY THAT OFTEN OCCURS WITH ABNORMAL MARKETS AND

RESULTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, IN A CONSERVATIVE STRESS-TEST RESULT.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED AT VARYING DATES EACH MONTH; THE

STRESS RESULTS AT DECEMBER 5, 2002, WERE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY EXPOSURES SENSITIVE

TO A STRESS SCENARIO WHERE CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND, AT THE SAME

TIME, EQUITY PRICES DECLINE AND INTEREST RATES FALL IN THE MAJOR CURRENCIES.

VAR RESULTS CANNOT BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO STRESS-TEST LOSS RESULTS FOR THREE

REASONS. FIRST, STRESS-TEST LOSSES ARE CALCULATED AT VARYING DATES EACH MONTH,

WHILE VAR IS PERFORMED DAILY AND REPORTED FOR THE PERIOD-END DATE. SECOND, VAR

AND STRESS TESTS ARE TWO DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS YIELDING VERY DIFFERENT

LOSS POTENTIALS. THUS, ALTHOUGH THE SAME TRADING PORTFOLIOS ARE USED FOR BOTH

TESTS, VAR IS BASED ON A DISTRIBUTION OF ONE-DAY HISTORICAL LOSSES MEASURED

OVER THE MOST RECENT ONE YEAR; IN CONTRAST, STRESS TESTING SUBJECTS THE

PORTFOLIO TO MORE EXTREME, LARGER MOVES OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON (E.G., 2-3

WEEKS). THIRD, AS VAR AND STRESS TESTS ARE DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS, THE

IMPACT OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION CAN VARY GREATLY. FOR VAR, MARKETS CAN

CHANGE IN PATTERNS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON, MOVING FROM HIGHLY CORRELATED

TO LESS SO; IN STRESS TESTING, THE FOCUS IS ON A SINGLE EVENT AND THE

ASSOCIATED CORRELATIONS IN AN EXTREME MARKET SITUATION. AS A RESULT, WHILE VAR

OVER A GIVEN TIME HORIZON CAN BE LOWERED BY A DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT IN THE

PORTFOLIO, THIS BENEFIT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MANIFEST ITSELF IN STRESS-TEST

SCENARIOS, WHICH ASSUME LARGE COHERENT MOVES ACROSS ALL MARKETS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS BOTH ECONOMIC-VALUE AND NII STRESS TESTS ON ITS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIOS AND A/L ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ON A TRADING BASIS.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THESE

PORTFOLIOS UNDER THE SAME SCENARIOS USED TO EVALUATE THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS.

THE LARGEST POTENTIAL STRESS-TEST LOSS OF THESE PORTFOLIOS AS OF DECEMBER 5,

2002, IS UNDER A SCENARIO THAT ASSUMES A SHARP WIDENING IN CREDIT SPREADS AND

DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES. IF THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS EXCLUDED, THE

LARGEST POTENTIAL STRESS-TEST LOSS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SCENARIO THAT ASSUMES A

SMALLER WIDENING IN CREDIT SPREADS BUT ALSO ASSUMES SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN

EQUITY PRICES AND INCREASES IN MARKET VOLATILITIES. AT PRESENT, THE

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS DO NOT INCLUDE CONSUMER LOANS, THE VALUE OF WHICH

IS MORE DIFFICULT TO RELATE TO EXTERNAL MARKET VARIABLES; THIS WILL BE THE

SUBJECT OF CONTINUED RESEARCH.

THE MORE CONVENTIONAL NII STRESS TEST MEASURES THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE

FIRMS NII OVER THE NEXT YEAR. THESE STRESS TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO

VARIOUS INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS RATES (E.G., THE PRIME-LENDING

RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. NII STRESS

TESTS ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET

SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

AT YEAR-END 2002, JPMORGAN CHASES LARGEST POTENTIAL NII STRESS LOSS WAS

ESTIMATED AT $277 MILLION, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF POTENTIAL COMPRESSION IN

DEPOSIT SPREADS ASSOCIATED WITH FURTHER RATE DECLINES FROM THE CURRENT LOW-RATE

ENVIRONMENT.

OTHER STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

IN ADDITION TO VAR, JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYS THE RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE

EXPOSURES (RIFLE) METHODOLOGY AS ANOTHER STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE. THE FIRM

REQUIRES THAT ALL MARKET RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES SELF ASSESS THEIR RISKS TO

UNUSUAL AND SPECIFIC EVENTS. INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS,

PARTICULARLY COMPLEX POSITIONS, IDENTIFY POTENTIAL WORST-CASE LOSSES THAT

COULD ARISE FROM AN UNUSUAL OR SPECIFIC EVENT, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL TAX CHANGE,

AND ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITIES OF SUCH LOSSES. THROUGH THE FIRMS RIFLE SYSTEM,

THIS INFORMATION IS THEN DIRECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT,

THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO IDENTIFY FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITIES NOT

ADEQUATELY COVERED BY VAR AND STRESS TESTING.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN

POSITIONS, BASIS POINT VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, POSITION CONCENTRATIONS

AND POSITION TURNOVER. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AN

EXPOSURES SIZE AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS MOVING. NONSTATISTICAL

MEASURES ARE USED FOR LIMIT MONITORING, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND TACTICAL CONTROL.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR MARKET RISK

THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL

SHOULD REFLECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH RISKS ARE PRESENT IN BUSINESSES. DAILY VAR,

MONTHLY STRESS RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CHARGES

FOR MAJOR BUSINESS LINES. THE VAR MEASURE CAPTURES A LARGE NUMBER OF ONE-DAY

PRICE MOVES, WHILE STRESS TESTS CAPTURE A SMALLER NUMBER OF VERY LARGE PRICE

MOVES. THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH DIVISION ACCORDING TO A

FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT DIVISIONS VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

THE FIRM CONTROLS MARKET RISK PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. THE SIZES

OF LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK APPETITE AFTER EXTENSIVE ANALYSES OF THE

MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE ANALYSES EXAMINE FACTORS SUCH AS

MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRACK RECORD, AND MANAGEMENT

EXPERIENCE AND DEPTH.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS ENCOMPASS

VAR CALCULATIONS AND STRESS-TEST LOSS ADVISORIES. SIMILARLY, BUSINESS SEGMENT

LEVELS INCLUDE LIMITS ON VAR CALCULATIONS, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS, AND P&L

LOSS ADVISORIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS,

AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED DAILY. EXCEEDED LIMITS ARE

REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS UNIT MUST

TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS. IF THE BUSINESS CANNOT DO

THIS WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIMEFRAME, SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS CONSULTED ON THE

APPROPRIATE ACTION.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS, AND THE

FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE RISK LIMITS AT LEAST

TWICE A YEAR. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT FURTHER CONTROLS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE BY

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATING APPROVED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH BUSINESS UNIT.

QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT

THE FIRMS MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ALSO PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF BOTH

BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE

ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL MARKET RISK. THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENTS

STRATEGY, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK CONTROLS

ARE REVIEWED. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

MANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, BUT ARE INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE

USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS REPORTING RISK AGAINST LIMITS,

AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. THE FIRM REVIEWS THE MODELS IT USES TO ASSESS MODEL

APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS BUSINESSES. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A

NUMBER OF ISSUES: APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MODEL, ASSESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH

IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND CAPTURES ITS

SIGNIFICANT RISKS; INDEPENDENCE AND RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES;

APPROPRIATENESS AND ADEQUACY OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS; AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT

PARAMETERS OR OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED FOR NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED

MODELS. RE-REVIEWS ASSESS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE

ACCEPTED MODELS; WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET

THAT MAY IMPACT THE VALIDITY OF THE MODEL; AND WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN NEW

THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE A REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 65-67.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SURROUNDING MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE GOAL IS TO SPECIFY A CLEAR SET OF OBJECTIVES,

RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES THROUGHOUT THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO RISK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING

AND CONTROL ACROSS BUSINESS LINES.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED

PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS, OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.



OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS A PRINCIPAL RISK DISCIPLINE WITHIN THE FIRM



BUSINESS MANAGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS TO MANAGE OPERATIONAL RISK



THE FIRM IS EXECUTING A MULTI-YEAR PLAN FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO MEASURING, ANALYZING, AND MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK



REPUTATION RISK ARISES WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY MANAGE ITS

CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, OR DOES NOT MAINTAIN BUSINESS

PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST ETHICAL QUALITY

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT

ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING

ERRORS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, AND

VENDORS NOT PERFORMING IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS. THESE

EVENTS CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING CAUSING IT REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND

WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK

AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE

COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES. THE

FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH

LOSSES.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

THROUGHOUT 2002, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO EXECUTE A MULTI-YEAR PLAN, BEGUN IN

2001, FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT EMPHASIZES ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO

SUPPLEMENT THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK

MEASURES, TOOLS AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED

AND UTILIZED FIRM-WIDE. KEY THEMES FOR THIS EFFORT ARE TRANSPARENCY OF

INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES, AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

RESIDES WITH THE VICE CHAIRMAN FOR FINANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.

THE COMPONENTS ARE.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE

FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR

MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK RESTS WITH BUSINESS MANAGERS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROL

PROCEDURES FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF SENIOR OPERATIONAL RISK AND

FINANCE MANAGERS FROM EACH OF THE BUSINESSES. THIS COMMITTEE MEETS QUARTERLY TO

DISCUSS KEY OPERATIONAL RISK ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE FIRM. IN ADDITION,

EACH OF THE BUSINESSES MUST MAINTAIN BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEES TO OVERSEE

THEIR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

IN 2002, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS FIRM-WIDE

SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE FOCUS OF THE PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO

IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT, AND ASSESS THE

DEGREE TO WHICH IT IS MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE

DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

SELF-ASSESSMENTS ARE COMPLETED BY THE BUSINESSES UTILIZING HORIZON, A SOFTWARE

APPLICATION DEVELOPED BY THE FIRM. WITH THE AID OF HORIZON, THE FIRM MOVED IN

2002 FROM AN ANNUAL, YEAREND SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS TO ONE PERFORMED

SEMIANNUALLY. GOING FORWARD, THE FIRM PLANS TO UTILIZE THIS SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS AS AN ONGOING, DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL.

OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT MONITORING.

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR REPORTING

OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSES OF ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL

AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSES, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY

RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF ROOT CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK

EVENTS FACED BY THE BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE

SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY

PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED WILL ALSO ENABLE THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST AGAINST

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT.

IN ADDITION TO CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS, THE

FIRMS INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON THE DESIGN AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK. THIS GUIDANCE HAS HELPED

FURTHER THE FIRM-WIDE

63

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRAMEWORK, WHICH IN TURN HAS LED TO A STRONGER OVERALL

CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. THE DEPARTMENT UTILIZES OUTPUT SUCH AS BUSINESS

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS TO HELP FOCUS ALLOCATION OF ITS RESOURCES, THEREBY

MAXIMIZING THE EFFICIENCIES OF ITS INTERNAL AUDIT RESPONSIBILITIES. THE

DEPARTMENT ALSO REVIEWS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS DURING THE CONDUCT OF AUDITS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISK

HISTORICALLY, A COMBINED CAPITAL AMOUNT FOR OPERATIONAL RISK AND BUSINESS RISK

(COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS OPERATING RISK CAPITAL) WAS DERIVED THROUGH

TOP-DOWN BENCHMARKING, BY BUSINESS, AGAINST COMPARABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

IN 2003, A NEW RISK-BASED CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WILL REPLACE THE

EXISTING APPROACH. THE NEW METHODOLOGY WILL SEPARATE OPERATING RISK CAPITAL

INTO ITS TWO DISCRETE COMPONENTS, OPERATIONAL RISK AND BUSINESS RISK. THE NEW

APPROACH WILL ESTIMATE THESE RISKS INDEPENDENTLY AND ALLOCATE CAPITAL TO EACH

COMPONENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THIS NEW APPROACH WILL RESULT IN A LOWER AMOUNT

OF CAPITAL THAN PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED.

OPERATIONAL RISK: THE NEW OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL IS LOSS-BASED, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, AND

WITH A POTENTIAL OFFSET FOR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT THE MODEL WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED BASLE II ACCORD,

AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT EVENTUALLY FOR QUALIFICATION UNDER THE ADVANCED

MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

BUSINESS RISK: BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE

VOLATILITY IN THE FIRMS EARNINGS DUE TO FACTORS NOT CAPTURED BY OTHER PARTS OF

THE FIRMS ECONOMIC CAPITAL FRAMEWORK. SUCH VOLATILITY CAN ARISE FROM

INEFFECTIVE DESIGN OR EXECUTION OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES, VOLATILE ECONOMIC OR

FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITY, CHANGING CLIENT EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS, AND

RESTRUCTURING TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. CAPITAL

WILL BE ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS BASED ON HISTORICAL REVENUE VOLATILITY AND

MEASURES OF FIXED AND VARIABLE EXPENSES. EARNINGS VOLATILITY ARISING FROM OTHER

RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS CREDIT OR MARKET RISK, WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE

MEASUREMENT OF BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL, AS THESE FACTORS ARE CAPTURED UNDER THOSE

RISK CAPITAL MODELS.

REPUTATION RISK

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET

AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE OF ITS REPUTATION AMONG

MANY CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL

PUBLIC  FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

ATTENTION TO ITS REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS

PRACTICES AND MAINTENANCE OF REPUTATION IS EVERYONES RESPONSIBILITY. THE FIRM

BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS: CODES OF ETHICS,

TRAINING, POLICIES AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING A CONFLICTS OFFICE TO EXAMINE

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR ROLES FOR

THE FIRM.

DURING 2002, THE FIRM PUT IN PLACE AN ADDITIONAL STRUCTURE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF

THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS,

ESPECIALLY COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS. THE

STRUCTURE REINFORCES THE FIRMS PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING TRANSACTIONS IN TERMS

OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL ISSUES AND REPUTATIONAL RISK AND INTENSIFIES THE

FIRMS SCRUTINY OF THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS

POINT OF VIEW WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO DECEIVE

INVESTORS OR OTHERS. THIS NEW STRUCTURE OPERATES AT THREE LEVELS: AS PART OF

EVERY BUSINESS TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS, REVIEW BY REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW

COMMITTEES, AND OVERSIGHT BY THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

BUSINESS TRANSACTION APPROVAL

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADHERENCE WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED

TO ADDRESS REPUTATION RISK LIES WITH THE BUSINESS UNITS CONDUCTING THE

TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION. THIS TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES REVIEW AND

SIGN-OFF FROM, AMONG OTHERS, INTERNAL LEGAL/COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS, TAX AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUPS. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING AN SPE ESTABLISHED BY THE FIRM

RECEIVE PARTICULAR SCRUTINY AND MUST COMPLY WITH A SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLE

POLICY, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SUCH ENTITY IS PROPERLY APPROVED,

DOCUMENTED, MONITORED AND CONTROLLED.

REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES

BUSINESS UNITS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES

PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY RAISE REPUTATION RISK FOR ANY REASON 

INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, INTENDED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OF THE TRANSACTION

BY THE CLIENT  AND THE COMMITTEES APPROVE, REJECT OR REQUIRE FURTHER

CLARIFICATION OR CHANGES. THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE SENIOR

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS AND SUPPORT UNITS IN THE REGION. THE COMMITTEES

MAY ESCALATE TRANSACTION REVIEW TO THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE IS THE MOST SENIOR APPROVAL LEVEL FOR CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING REPUTATION ISSUES. THE MANDATE OF THE OFFICE IS TO OPINE

ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS BROUGHT BY THE REGIONAL COMMITTEES AND CONSIDER

CHANGES IN POLICIES OR PRACTICES RELATING TO REPUTATION RISK. THE HEAD OF THE

OFFICE CONSULTS WITH THE FIRMS MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AND

PROVIDES REGULAR UPDATES.

ASIDE FROM GOVERNANCE AND GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, THE OBJECTIVE OF

THE POLICY REVIEW PROCESS IS TO REINFORCE A CULTURE, THROUGH A CASE-STUDY

APPROACH, WHICH ENSURES THAT ALL EMPLOYEES, REGARDLESS OF SENIORITY, UNDERSTAND

THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF REPUTATION RISK CONTROL AND CAN RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS

ISSUES AS THEY ARISE.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

JPMORGAN PARTNERS EMPLOYS PROCESSES FOR RISK MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM. THE PROCESSES ARE

COORDINATED WITH THE FIRMS OVERALL APPROACH TO MARKET AND CONCENTRATION RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS INITIALLY MONITORED THROUGH THE USE OF INDUSTRY AND

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS. ADDITIONALLY, TO MANAGE THE PACE OF NEW INVESTMENT, A

CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT ACTIVITY HAS BEEN

SET.

JPMORGAN PARTNERS PUBLIC EQUITY HOLDINGS CREATE A SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO

GENERAL DECLINES IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. TO GAUGE THAT RISK, VAR AND STRESS-TEST

EXPOSURES ARE CALCULATED IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY ARE FOR THE FIRMS TRADING,

INVESTMENT AND ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIOS. DURING THE YEAR, JPMP

MANAGEMENT UNDERTOOK FREQUENT REVIEWS OF ITS PUBLIC SECURITY HOLDINGS AS PART

OF A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO SALES AND HEDGING ISSUES. HEDGING PROGRAMS ARE

VERY LIMITED, BUT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN PRACTICAL AND AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE.

OVER TIME, THE FIRM MAY CHANGE THE NATURE AND TYPE OF HEDGES IT ENTERS INTO, AS

WELL AS CLOSE A HEDGING POSITION ALTOGETHER.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR PRIVATE EQUITY RISK

INTERNAL CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO JPMPS PUBLIC EQUITIES PORTFOLIO BASED ON

STRESS SCENARIOS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE APPLIED TO OTHER BUSINESSES, AND

WHICH REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO IN THE EVENT OF A

LARGE EQUITY MARKET DECLINE. CAPITAL IS ALSO ALLOCATED AGAINST ILLIQUIDITY

RISK, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS TO WHICH SOME

HOLDINGS ARE SUBJECT. FOR PRIVATE EQUITIES, CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED BASED ON A

LONG-TERM EQUITY MARKET STRESS SCENARIO THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT

TIME HORIZONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE HOLDINGS. FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, ADDITIONAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED AGAINST THE RISK OF AN UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE NUMBER OF

WRITE-OFFS OR WRITE-DOWNS. THE OVERALL INTERNAL CAPITAL ALLOCATION IS

APPROXIMATELY 53% OF THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO

UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS REPORTED. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUATION OF ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND CONTROL

PROCEDURES THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY

JUDGMENTS MADE, ARE WELL CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED

CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN

APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE

VALUATION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE.

THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER

LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS

LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. MANAGEMENT ALSO

COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY

SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 10 ON PAGE 82.

COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH ALLOWANCES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE

DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS

LOANS. COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS

ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A

PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE OBLIGORS DEBT

CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE

AMOUNT AND SOURCES OF REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES,

MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR

OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION,

AS WELL AS SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR

OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY BE RELEVANT IN

DETERMINING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY

AN EXPLICIT PART OF THE FIRMS METHODOLOGY, COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING

ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH

EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THESE LOSS FACTORS ARE DETERMINED BY FACILITY STRUCTURE,

COLLATERAL AND TYPE OF OBLIGOR. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT,

VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR

ESTIMATING THESE LOSS FACTORS. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES

OF SPECIFIC LOSS AND EXPECTED LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF DEFAULT

PROBABILITIES, RATING MIGRATIONS AND LOSS SEVERITY. FOR EXAMPLE, JUDGMENT IS

65

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

REQUIRED TO DETERMINE HOW MANY YEARS OF DATA TO INCLUDE WHEN ESTIMATING THE

POSSIBLE SEVERITY OF THE LOSS. IF A FULL CREDIT CYCLE IS NOT CAPTURED IN THE

DATA, THEN ESTIMATES MAY BE INACCURATE. LIKEWISE, JUDGMENT IS APPLIED TO

DETERMINE WHETHER THE LOSS SEVERITY FACTOR SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE

OVER THE ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR WHETHER TO APPLY THE LOSS SEVERITY FACTOR

IMPLIED AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT

LOSS SEVERITY FACTORS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM. SIMILARLY, THERE ARE JUDGMENTS AS TO

WHICH EXTERNAL DATA ON DEFAULT PROBABILITIES SHOULD BE USED, AND WHEN THEY

SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC

LOAN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK

RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN. ASSUMING, FOR ALL COMMERCIAL LOANS, A ONE-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2002. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH

CAUTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT

RISK RATINGS HAVE ON THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR

COMMERCIAL LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF

FUTURE DETERIORATION IN RISK RATINGS. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN

DETERMINING RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CURRENT RISK

RATINGS ASSIGNED TO COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF A

ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR ALL COMMERCIAL LOANS IS REMOTE.

CONSUMER LOANS

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS SEGMENTED INTO THREE MAIN BUSINESS LINES: CHASE HOME

FINANCE, CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES AND CHASE AUTO FINANCE. FOR EACH MAJOR

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY FACTORS

THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES: PERIOD-END OUTSTANDINGS, EXPECTED LOSS FACTOR, AND AVERAGE

LIFE. THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THESE FACTORS, SUCH AS COLLATERAL, PREPAYMENT

RATES, CREDIT SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS, COLLECTIONS, AND THE HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT, DIFFER ACROSS BUSINESS LINES. FOR EXAMPLE,

CREDIT CARD REVOLVING CREDIT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHARGE-OFF RATIOS THAN

FIXED MORTGAGE CREDIT. DETERMINATION OF EACH FACTOR IS BASED PRIMARILY ON

STATISTICAL DATA AND MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS.

RESIDUAL COMPONENT

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO APPLIED WHEN CONSIDERING UNCERTAINTIES THAT

RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY DEVALUATION ON CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURES, CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS, UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO, OR OTHER FACTORS. FOR

EXAMPLE, JUDGMENT AS TO POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY WILL

AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE CREDITS THAT HAVE

EXPOSURE TO THAT COUNTRY. A SEPARATE ALLOWANCE COMPONENT, THE RESIDUAL

COMPONENT, IS MAINTAINED TO COVER THESE UNCERTAINTIES, PRINCIPALLY, AT DECEMBER

31, 2002, IN THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE RESIDUAL

COMPONENT WILL RANGE BETWEEN 10% AND 20% OF THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE,

INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AFS SECURITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF FAIR VALUE

OR COST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $369 BILLION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS

WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE VALUE AT WHICH POSITIONS COULD BE CLOSED OUT OR

SOLD IN A TRANSACTION WITH A WILLING AND KNOWLEDGEABLE COUNTERPARTY OVER A

PERIOD OF TIME CONSISTENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING OR INVESTMENT STRATEGY.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES OR ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT ARE BASED ON INDEPENDENTLY

SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE YIELD CURVES, OPTION

VOLATILITIES AND CURRENCY RATES. THE VALUATION PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND, FOR THE DERIVATIVE

PORTFOLIO, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. SEE THE DISCUSSION OF CVA ON PAGE 51.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING THE FACTORS USED IN THE VALUATION

PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS OFTEN LIMITED MARKET DATA TO RELY ON WHEN

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF A LARGE OR AGED POSITION. SIMILARLY, JUDGMENT MUST

BE APPLIED IN ESTIMATING PRICES FOR LESS READILY OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL

PARAMETERS. FINALLY, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, MARKET

DISLOCATIONS AND UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR

LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION.

TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES HELD FOR TRADING AND INVESTMENT

PURPOSES (LONG POSITIONS) AND SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER

PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF THE SECURITIES, FOR EXAMPLE HIGH YIELD INSTRUMENTS,

ARE LESS ACTIVELY TRADED. THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AS THIS DETERMINATION MAY REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES.

AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT

USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS

THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY-PRICING

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002

ANNUAL REPORT

SERVICES. CERTAIN DERIVATIVES, HOWEVER, ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS WITH

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MAY BE

ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO SUBSTANTIATE

THE MODEL VALUATION. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE LESS ACTIVELY TRADED AND COULD

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DATED INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY SWAPS, WHERE SWAP

RATES MAY BE UNOBSERVABLE FOR LONGER MATURITIES.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INCLUDES RECORDING FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (I.E.,

REDUCTIONS) TO MODEL VALUATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY WHEN

VALUING COMPLEX OR LESS ACTIVELY TRADED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

NETTING,AS CROSS-PRODUCT NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO A DISCUSSION ON VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES. THEREFORE,THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON GROSS MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES.

TO ENSURE THAT THE VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS CONTROLS IN

PLACE. THESE INCLUDE: AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF VALUATION MODELS;

DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION FOR PROFIT AND LOSS ANALYZED DAILY AND THROUGH

TIME; DECOMPOSING THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS WHERE POSSIBLE TO

SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH

SETTLEMENT. AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM REFINES ITS VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF ALL POSITIONS TAKEN

WITHIN THE INVESTMENT BANK.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE MODEL REVIEW PROCESS,

SEE PAGES 5862. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE

ACCOUNTING FOR TRADING DERIVATIVES, SEE PAGE 68. FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE

TRADING AND AFS PORTFOLIOS, SEE NOTE 3 AND NOTE 7, RESPECTIVELY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

VALUATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD BY JPMORGAN PARTNERS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK

OF LIQUIDITY AND LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE

INITIALLY VALUED BASED ON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE

ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY

FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY JPMPS SENIOR

INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO

ASSESS IMPAIRMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, COMPARABLE INDUSTRY VALUATIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES,

CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK, AND THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT OVER TIME. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE THE PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 65 AND NOTE 13 ON PAGE 88.

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT

TRADE IN AN ACTIVE OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE,

SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, BUT THE PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. AS SUCH, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND

CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. THE

MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING

FEES AND PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENT RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER

ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM

COMPARES ITS FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FAIR VALUES AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE COMPARABLE

TO THOSE USED BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE THESE RETAINED INTERESTS, AS WELL AS

THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTES 11 AND 12 ON PAGES

8387 AND 8788, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

IN AUGUST 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION TO ADOPT SFAS 123,

BEGINNING JANUARY 2003. SFAS 123 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION THAT REQUIRES ALL SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, TO

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND SUCH AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2003, USING THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, ALL NEW

AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003 WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT FAIR VALUE. AWARDS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IF NOT SUBSEQUENTLY

MODIFIED, CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123, WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2003, WILL REDUCE THE FIRMS NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY

$0.08 PER SHARE IN 2003.

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46. THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE ASSESSED

FOR CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46 ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES (SPES), ALTHOUGH OTHER NON-SPE-TYPE ENTITIES MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO

THE GUIDANCE. FIN 46 REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY

A COMPANY IF THAT COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A MAJORITY OF THE RISK OF LOSS FROM THE

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITYS ACTIVITIES OR ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE

ENTITYS RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. THE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANY NEW

ENTITIES THAT ARE ORIGINATED SUBSEQUENT TO JANUARY 31, 2003. FOR ENTITIES THAT

WERE ORIGINATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 ARE

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003.

THE FIRM IS ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF FIN 46 ON ALL VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WITH WHICH IT IS INVOLVED, INCLUDING THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS THAT

ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 ON PAGES 8387. IN THEIR CURRENT FORM, THESE CONDUITS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE

CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET WHEN FIN 46 IS IMPLEMENTED. THE FIRM

IS ASSESSING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBLE CONSOLIDATIONS OF OTHER ENTITIES

THAT COULD BE DEEMED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES IS ONGOING AS WELL. HOWEVER, AT

THIS TIME, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46 WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, EARNINGS OR

CAPITAL RESOURCES.

GUARANTOR DISCLOSURES

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 45, WHICH REQUIRES A

GUARANTOR TO RECOGNIZE, AT INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 ALSO

REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO BE MADE BY A GUARANTOR IN ITS INTERIM AND

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT

IT HAS ISSUED. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS INTERPRETATION ARE EFFECTIVE

FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF THIS INTERPRETATION ARE APPLICABLE ON A PROSPECTIVE

BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE APPLICATION

OF FIN 45 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME OR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES

102103 FOR FIN

45 DISCLOSURES.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRADING DERIVATIVES

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE EMERGING ISSUES

TASK FORCE CONCLUDED ON ISSUE 0203,

WHICH PRECLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY-RELATED CONTRACTS THAT DO

NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE UNDER SFAS 133 (E.G., TRANSPORTATION,

STORAGE, OR CAPACITY CONTRACTS) EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS DECISION WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. IN

NOVEMBER 2002, AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION OF ISSUE 0203, THE FASB STAFF

FURTHER CONFIRMED THEIR VIEW THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD NOT RECOGNIZE PROFIT AT THE

INCEPTION OF A TRADE INVOLVING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IN THE ABSENCE

OF: (A) QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, (B) OBSERVABLE PRICES OF

OTHER CURRENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS, OR (C) OTHER OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING A

VALUATION TECHNIQUE. THIS CLARIFICATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN 2002. THE FASB INTENDS IN 2003 TO

CONTINUE ITS FOCUS ON ISSUES RELATING TO THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

IN AUGUST 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 144, WHICH ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT AND/OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. SFAS 144

SUPERSEDES AND RESOLVES CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES OF SFAS 121, BUT RETAINS

ITS FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS FOR (A) THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF THE

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED AND (B) THE MEASUREMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE. SFAS 144 ALSO SUPERSEDES THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISPOSAL PROVISIONS OF APB 30, BUT RETAINS ITS REQUIREMENT TO

REPORT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS SEPARATELY FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND

BROADENS ITS DEFINITION OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FROM SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS

(ACTIVITIES THAT REPRESENT A MAJOR LINE OF BUSINESS OR CUSTOMER) TO COMPONENT

OF AN ENTITY (OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS THAT CAN CLEARLY BE DISTINGUISHED,

OPERATIONALLY AND FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, FROM THE REST OF THE

ENTITY). SFAS 144 DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS.

THE FIRM PERFORMS PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 144, AND THERE ARE NO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TO REPORT IN

2002.

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 146, WHICH ESTABLISHES NEW ACCOUNTING FOR

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2002. SFAS 146 REQUIRES A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR

DISPOSAL ACTIVITY TO BE RECORDED WHEN THAT LIABILITY IS INCURRED AND CAN BE

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. UNDER THE PREVIOUS RULES, IF MANAGEMENT APPROVED AN

EXIT PLAN IN ONE QUARTER, THE COSTS OF THAT PLAN GENERALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECORDED IN THE SAME QUARTER EVEN IF THE COSTS WERE NOT INCURRED UNTIL A LATER

QUARTER. IN

J.P. MORGAN CHASE &

CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

68

CONTRAST, UNDER SFAS 146, SOME COSTS MAY QUALIFY FOR IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION,

WHILE OTHER COSTS MAY BE INCURRED OVER ONE OR MORE QUARTERS. THE IMPACT OF SFAS

146 WILL BE TO SPREAD OUT THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

IN 1999, THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE

OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FORMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TASK FORCE

(TASK FORCE) TO RESEARCH CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND PRACTICES AS THEY

RELATE TO LOAN LOSSES. IT IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED THAT THE TASK FORCE WILL ISSUE

AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF A STATEMENT OF POSITION IN 2003 THAT WILL PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDANCE AND CLARIFICATION OF THE FACTORS

TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 142 WHICH ESTABLISHES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN THOSE ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION). IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO AN ACQUISITION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 142, SEE NOTE 14.

COMPARISON BETWEEN 2001 AND 2000

JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTED 2001 NET INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH NET

INCOME OF $5.7 BILLION IN 2000. REPORTED NET INCOME PER SHARE WAS $0.80 IN

2001, COMPARED WITH $2.86 IN 2000.

TOTAL REPORTED REVENUES FOR 2001 OF $29.3 BILLION WERE DOWN 12% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED LOSSES ON PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND, TO A

LESSER DEGREE, LOWER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND TRADING REVENUES, WHICH

INCLUDED $359 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO ENRON AND ARGENTINA.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE NET GAINS ON SALES OF NONSTRATEGIC ASSETS

OF $1.3 BILLION IN 2000. THE REVENUE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

NET INTEREST INCOME, PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER VOLUMES OF INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS

(PARTICULARLY CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES), AND SECURITY

GAINS FROM SALES OF AFS SECURITIES THAT HAD BEEN POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM

2001S LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.

THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS REPORTED MIXED REVENUE RESULTS IN 2001. IN IB,

REVENUES WERE LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE OVERALL MARKET DECLINE

IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING AND M&A ACTIVITIES; RECORD FEES FROM BOND UNDERWRITING

DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE DECLINES. TRADING-RELATED

REVENUES IN 2001 WERE ALSO LOWER THAN IN 2000, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THINNER

MARGINS ON SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND A REDUCED DEMAND FOR EQUITY

DERIVATIVES. IMPBS REVENUES DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTING THE LOWER

VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, A LOWER VOLUME OF INTERNATIONAL RETAIL FUND

FLOWS AND A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE WAS ALSO A

DECREASE IN FEES DRIVEN BY CLIENTS SHIFTING FROM HIGHER-MARGIN EQUITY TO

LOWER-MARGIN FIXED-INCOME PRODUCTS. JPMP RECOGNIZED PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES OF

$1.2 BILLION IN 2001, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $1.0 BILLION IN 2000, ATTRIBUTABLE

TO UNFAVORABLE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ON BOTH PUBLICLY- AND PRIVATELY-HELD

INVESTMENTS  PARTICULARLY IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

SECTORS. OFFSETTING THESE REVENUE DECLINES WAS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN REVENUE AT

T&SS, REFLECTING REVENUE GROWTH AT INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES AND TREASURY

SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE AT INVESTOR SERVICES RESULTING FROM

DEPRESSED MARKET PRICES FOR EQUITY SECURITIES AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. CFS HAD

SOLID REVENUE GROWTH, DRIVEN BY GREATER CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND HIGHER

FEES FROM INCREASED UTILIZATION OF CONSUMER BANKING AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN

2001. WHILE REVENUE WAS REDUCED BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INCREASED LEVELS OF

MORTGAGE LOAN PREPAYMENTS DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES, THESE DECLINES WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SECURITIES GAINS AND RECORD MORTGAGE SALES

ACTIVITY.

THE FIRMS TOTAL REPORTED NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $23.6 BILLION IN 2001, UP 2%

FROM 2000, REFLECTING HIGHER MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY

LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE. MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS INCREASED TO $2.5

BILLION IN 2001 FROM $1.4 BILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED

TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER OF J.P. MORGAN AND CHASE, INCLUDING SYSTEMS

INTEGRATION, REALIGNMENT OF FACILITIES AND RETENTION OR SEVERANCE PAYMENTS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FELL 6%, DRIVEN BY STAFF REDUCTIONS AND LOWER INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN EARNINGS.

AT THE BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, IB, IMPB AND JPMP ALL REPORTED LOWER NONINTEREST

EXPENSE LARGELY DRIVEN BY REDUCTIONS IN HEAD-COUNT RELATED TO THE MERGER AND

LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. T&SS EXPENSES ROSE SLIGHTLY AS A RESULT OF

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS ACROSS ITS THREE BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY EXPENSE-CONTROL

INITIATIVES. CFS ALSO REPORTED HIGHER EXPENSES IN 2001, STEMMING FROM HIGHER

MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING COSTS, THE ACQUISITION OF ADVANTA CORP.S MORTGAGE

BUSINESS AND HIGHER CREDIT CARD MARKETING COSTS; THESE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY SAVINGS ACHIEVED THROUGH RESTRUCTURING, PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY

PROGRAMS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2001 ROSE TO $3.2 BILLION FROM $1.4 BILLION

IN 2000. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS IN BOTH

THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE LOAN

LOSS ALLOWANCE BY $850 MILLION (DUE TO PROVISIONS IN EXCESS OF NET

CHARGE-OFFS). THE INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL CHARGE-OFFS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT

OF HIGHER DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL NET CHARGE-OFFS, PARTICULARLY IN THE TELECOM AND

RELATED SECTOR AND FOR ENRON. THE HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CONSUMER LOAN

PORTFOLIO WERE DUE TO HIGHER CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY LEVELS, AS WELL AS HIGHER

NONBANKRUPTCY-RELATED LOSSES.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2001 WAS $847 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.0 BILLION IN

2000. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 33% FOR 2001, COMPARED WITH 34% FOR 2000. THE

DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE

IN REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME.

NOTE 7 SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS), HELD-TO-MATURITY

(HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED WITHIN NOTE 3 ON PAGES

7677. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS WHEN, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, THEY

MAY BE SOLD IN RESPONSE TO OR IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AFTER SFAS 133 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS

NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) ON

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT

AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE LIKELIHOOD OF PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENT THROUGH ITS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY PERFORMS SIMULATION TESTING TO DETERMINE THE

IMPACT THAT MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE ON ITS MBS AND CMO PORTFOLIOS. MBSS

AND CMOS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES HAVE HIGH PREPAYMENT RISK ARE INCLUDED IN THE

AFS PORTFOLIO AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF RELATED

DERIVATIVES ON AFS SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF

DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE

APPLICABLE.

(B)

INCLUDES SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN

CHASES MBSS AND CMOS ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS

BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS FOR

MBSS AND LESS THAN ONE YEAR FOR CMOS.

NOTE 8 SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS

PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO

COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS AND TO

ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) ARE

GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL BE

SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. WHERE APPROPRIATE,

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A

NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 41. JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE

MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM ITS

COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND

AGENCY SECURITIES, AND REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES

WHEN NECESSARY.

SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER THAN FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE) OF THE

UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A FORWARD OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE

SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A DERIVATIVE, IS RECORDED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT ITS FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS PURCHASES UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $8 BILLION AND $6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

SALES UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $13 BILLION AND $27 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE SHORT-TERM DURATION OF THESE CONTRACTS, THE

UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IS INSIGNIFICANT.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH

COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST

INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE PLEDGES CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IT OWNS TO COLLATERALIZE

CAN BE SOLD OR REPLEDGED BY THE SECURED PARTY ARE IDENTIFIED AS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OWNED (PLEDGED TO VARIOUS PARTIES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL THAT CAN

BE REPLEDGED, DELIVERED OR OTHERWISE USED WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$214 BILLION. THIS COLLATERAL WAS GENERALLY OBTAINED UNDER REVERSE REPURCHASE

OR SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS. OF THESE SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY $199

BILLION WERE REPLEDGED, DELIVERED OR OTHERWISE USED, GENERALLY AS COLLATERAL

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS, OR TO COVER SHORT

SALES.

NOTE 9 LOANS

LOANS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF AGGREGATE COST OR FAIR VALUE.

LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING FOR SECONDARY MARKET TRADING ACTIVITIES WHERE

POSITIONS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD TO MAKE PROFITS FROM SHORT-TERM

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

80

MOVEMENTS IN PRICE. LOANS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING

ASSETS AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN

TRADING REVENUE. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST METHOD OR ON

A BASIS APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED.

LOANS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF

PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR

MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE

AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON

NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN CASH.

HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN

PRINCIPAL, ALL CASH THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE LOAN. LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY

ASSURED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON

REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE,

CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF AT THE EARLIER OF 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN

60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING OF BANKRUPTCY. RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 180 DAYS

PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF (TO NET REALIZABLE

VALUE IF COLLATERALIZED) AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, AUTO FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE.

ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST

INCOME WHEN THE CONSUMER LOAN IS CHARGED OFF.

A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURE AND IS

RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AS LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER ASSETS,

ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL,

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

NOTE 10 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES FOR WHICH EITHER THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF

THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. WITHIN THE ALLOWANCE, THERE ARE

SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS AND A RESIDUAL COMPONENT.

THE SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT COVERS THOSE COMMERCIAL LOANS DEEMED BY THE FIRM TO

BE CRITICIZED. THE FIRM INTERNALLY CATEGORIZES ITS CRITICIZED COMMERCIAL LOANS

INTO THREE GROUPS: DOUBTFUL, SUBSTANDARD AND SPECIAL MENTION.

CRITICIZED NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS (EXCLUDING LEASES) ARE CONSIDERED TO

BE IMPAIRED LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS IS COMPUTED USING THE

METHODOLOGY UNDER SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS (OR COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF AN IMPAIRED LOAN

ARE LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE SPECIFIC LOSS

COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY,

AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. CRITICIZED BUT PERFORMING LOANS

ALSO ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL, USING HISTORICAL LOSS RATES.

THE EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS (EXCEPT

CRITICIZED LOANS) AND CONSUMER LOANS.

EXPECTED LOSSES ARE THE PRODUCT OF DEFAULT PROBABILITY AND LOSS SEVERITY. THESE

FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND MATURITY FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS.

THE EXPECTED LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO ARE BASED

PRIMARILY ON THE FIRMS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT

PORTFOLIO.

FINALLY, A RESIDUAL COMPONENT IS MAINTAINED TO COVER UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD

AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES. THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE

ALLOWANCE REFLECTS THE MARGIN OF IMPRECISION IN THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS USED

FOR ESTIMATING SPECIFIC LOSSES AND EXPECTED LOSSES. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE

RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WILL RANGE BETWEEN 10% AND 20% OF THE TOTAL

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWS, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED BASED ON

THAT REVIEW IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE TO BE ADEQUATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT

TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BUT ARE NOT YET

IDENTIFIABLE).

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSSES INHERENT IN THE CREDIT EXTENSION PROCESS,

MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS A

RESIDUAL COMPONENT, FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR

TO THAT USED FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

NOTE 11 SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE TERMS SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY (SPE) AND SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLE (SPV)

ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY IN PRACTICE. SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS

TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. THEY ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CRITICAL TO

THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS

AND ARE TYPICALLY SET UP FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT OPERATING

ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE NO EMPLOYEES AND A LIMITED LIFE. THE BASIC SPE

STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL

DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE SPE TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE

ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO ITS INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO

THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE, THEREBY

INSULATING INVESTORS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES,

INCLUDING THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

WHERE JPMORGAN CHASE IS A TRANSFEROR OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE, THE ASSETS

SOLD ARE DERECOGNIZED AND THE SPE IS NOT CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS BALANCE

SHEET WHEN THE ASSETS ARE: (1) LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS, (2)

THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET, AND (3) THE SPE IS A QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE) UNDER SFAS 140. WHEN AN SPE DOES NOT MEET THE

FORMAL DEFINITION OF A QSPE, THE DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO CONSOLIDATE DEPENDS

ON THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR NON-QSPES, INCLUDING A

DETERMINATION REGARDING THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT MADE BY THIRD

PARTIES IN THE SPE. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WHETHER A THIRD PARTY HAS MADE

A SUBSTANTIVE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE SPE; WHICH PARTY HAS VOTING RIGHTS, IF

ANY; WHO MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THE ASSETS IN THE SPE; AND WHO IS AT RISK FOR

LOSS. THE SPE IS CONSOLIDATED IF JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS OR ACQUIRES CONTROL

OVER THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE. ALL TRANSACTIONS AND

RETAINED INTERESTS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND SPES ARE REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN CHASES

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OR IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT AN SPE

TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED

AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO

JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS

INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS WORLDWIDE RULES OF

CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND FROM ACTING ON

BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SPES IN THREE BROAD CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES, SELLS AND SERVICES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT

CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND COMMERCIAL LOANS. ASSETS SOLD TO SPES AS PART OF THE

SECURITIZATION PROCESS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW) BUT ARE

INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE SPE PURCHASING THE ASSETS. ASSETS HELD BY

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, SUBORDINATED TRANCHES,

ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND SERVICING RIGHTS, AND THEY ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN OTHER

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE

FIRMS INTERESTS IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

SECURITIZED. THESE INTERESTS ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE

FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN

LOANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE,

CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS IT ESTABLISHES. THE FIRM RECEIVES ANNUAL SERVICING FEES BASED

ON THE SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE PLUS CERTAIN ANCILLARY FEES. IT ALSO RETAINS

THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IT SELLS IN CONNECTION WITH

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE

ASSOCIATION (GNMA), FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FNMA) AND

FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC). FOR A DISCUSSION OF

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, SEE NOTE 12.

GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED ON SECURITIZATIONS AND SALES DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE ASSETS SOLD

AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE OF

SALE. SINCE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM USUALLY

ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY DETERMINING THE PRESENT

VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS

INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS

INVOLVED. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS AND SALES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER REVENUE.

RETAINED INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK SUCH THAT JPMORGAN CHASE

MAY NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTED IN

DURING 2002, THE FIRM SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $7.2 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS, $9.4 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS, $3.4 BILLION OF AUTOMOBILE

LOANS AND $4.3 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL LOANS, RESULTING IN PRE-TAX GAINS ON

SECURITIZATIONS OF $214 MILLION, $45 MILLION, $6 MILLION AND $53 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2001, THE FIRM SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $7.9 BILLION OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $6 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS, $2.5 BILLION OF

AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND $5.5 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL LOANS, RESULTING IN PRE-TAX

GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $242 MILLION, $42 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $40

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM SOLD RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

TOTALING $62.2 BILLION AND $45.8 BILLION DURING 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY,

PRIMARILY AS GNMA, FNMA AND FREDDIE MAC MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; THESE SALES

RESULTED IN GAINS OF $388 MILLION IN 2002 AND $262 MILLION IN 2001.

ON FEBRUARY 5, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST,

CONSISTING OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES OF APPROXIMATELY $7.9 BILLION AND RELATED

RELATIONSHIPS. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRED THAT ALL OF THE PURCHASED

RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAD BEEN SECURITIZED, BE INITIALLY REFLECTED

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, TOGETHER WITH A RELATED LIABILITY TO

REFLECT THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST TO THIRD PARTIES. THIS LIABILITY

TOTALED $6.3 BILLION ON FEBRUARY 5, 2002, AND WAS RECORDED IN OTHER BORROWED

FUNDS. AS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES REVOLVE, AND NEW RECEIVABLES ARE SOLD TO

INVESTORS THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION TRUST, THESE NEWLY SOLD RECEIVABLES AND

RELATED LIABILITY ARE REMOVED FROM THE BALANCE SHEET AS PERMITTED BY

SECURITIZATION ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE ACQUISITION

DATE TO DECEMBER 31, 2002, $5.6 BILLION OF THE LIABILITY HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, EITHER THROUGH THE REVOLVING SALES OF NEW

RECEIVABLES TO INVESTORS OR THE MATURING OF INVESTOR SECURITIES. AT DECEMBER

31, 2002, $0.7 BILLION OF THE ORIGINALLY PURCHASED AND SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES,

AND THE RELATED LIABILITY OF $0.7 BILLION, REMAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE

INTEREST RATE OF THE REMAINING LIABILITY IS A COMBINATION OF FIXED AND VARIABLE

RATES, WHICH REFLECTS THE COUPON RATES OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED TO THIRD

PARTIES. THESE RATES RANGED FROM 1.53% TO 7.98% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE

LIABILITY IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE BALANCE SHEET BY

JUNE 2003. IN ADDITION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FIRM HAD ON ITS BALANCE SHEET

$2.7 BILLION RELATING TO ITS UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE PROVIDIAN MASTER TRUST

AND $117 MILLION RELATED TO ITS SUBORDINATED INTEREST IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND

FEES ON SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, JPMORGAN CHASE HAD $4.6 BILLION AND $3.9

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ITS UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN ITS CHASE CREDIT

CARD MASTER TRUST, AND $861 MILLION AND $878 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS

SUBORDINATED INTEREST IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES ON THE SECURITIZED

RECEIVABLES. THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO PREDETERMINED LIMITS

FOR SOME OF ITS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE

SECURITIZATIONS, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS OWED TO

INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN SUCH ESCROW ACCOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

ASSETS AND, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AMOUNTED TO $510 MILLION AND $94 MILLION

FOR CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY; AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2001, THESE AMOUNTS WERE $1 MILLION, $341 MILLION AND $79 MILLION FOR

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM HAD OTHER RETAINED SECURITIZATION INTERESTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, OF $684 MILLION AND $1 BILLION FROM RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES, $92 MILLION AND $38 MILLION FROM CREDIT CARDS, $151 MILLION AND $141

MILLION FROM AUTO LOANS, AND $94 MILLION AND $66 MILLION FROM COMMERCIAL LOANS.

THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE PRIMARILY SUBORDINATED OR RESIDUAL INTERESTS.

OF APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION THAT ARE VALUED USING A 30% DISCOUNT RATE.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE BASED ON A 10% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE

EXTRAPOLATED EASILY, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS

TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT

THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE

FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER ASSUMPTION, WHICH MIGHT COUNTERACT OR

CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT RECEIVING

AT LEAST AN A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, AN F-1 RATING.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK HAS COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THESE VEHICLES IN

AN AMOUNT UP TO $23.5 BILLION. THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING

UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT FUNDING FOR SUCH SPES BECAME

UNAVAILABLE IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. IN ADDITION, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK

WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, F-1, THE FIRM COULD ALSO

BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS, SINCE COMMERCIAL PAPER

RATED BELOW A-1, P-1 OR F-1 WOULD GENERALLY NOT BE ISSUABLE BY THE VEHICLE.

UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK COULD EITHER REPLACE ITSELF AS

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER OR FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS HELD IN

THE SPE IN OTHER MARKETS. JPMORGAN CHASE APPLIES THE SAME UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS IN MAKING LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO CONDUITS AS THE FIRM WOULD WITH

OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT.

FOR CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO PROVIDES LIMITED CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. UNDER THE

LETTERS OF CREDIT, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AND AMOUNTS DRAWN UNDER THE LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENT, IF ANY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LETTERS OF

CREDIT TOTALED $3.4 BILLION.

THE FIRM HAS LIMITED CREDIT EXPOSURE TO MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS. THIS

IS BECAUSE, FOR THE MOST PART, THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRED TO FUND UNDER THE

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE ARE IN DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, THE

FIRMS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE SECONDARY TO THE RISK OF

FIRST LOSS PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES  FOR EXAMPLE, BY THE

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF THE SPE WITH THE ASSETS SOLD TO IT.

CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED IN STRUCTURING SPE

TRANSACTIONS TO MEET INVESTOR AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES VARIOUS

TYPES OF RISKS (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND CREDIT)

TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM ALSO

PROVIDES LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE SPES TO FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION.

EACH OF THE FIRMS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SPES IS REFLECTED ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OR IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

RISKS INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED

SIMILAR TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED.

IN ITS CAPACITY AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM HAS CREATED STRUCTURED

COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES IN WHICH LOANS ARE PURCHASED

FROM THIRD PARTIES OR THROUGH THE FIRMS SYNDICATION AND TRADING FUNCTIONS AND

FUNDED BY ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER. INVESTORS PROVIDE COLLATERAL AND HAVE A

FIRST RISK OF LOSS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED. THE FIRM RETAINS A

SECOND RISK OF LOSS POSITION FOR THESE VEHICLES. THE DOCUMENTATION INCLUDES

PROVISIONS INTENDED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO ENABLE JPMORGAN CHASE TO

TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR LOAN VEHICLE IF THE VALUE OF

THE RELEVANT PORTFOLIO DECLINES BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. THE AMOUNT OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THESE VEHICLES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, TOTALED

$7.2 BILLION. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK HAS A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO

THESE SPES IN AN AMOUNT UP TO $12.0 BILLION.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO STRUCTURES SPES TO MODIFY THE CASH FLOWS OF THIRD-PARTY

ASSETS TO CREATE INVESTMENTS WITH SPECIFIC RISK PROFILES, OR TO ASSIST CLIENTS

IN THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF OTHER RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM STRUCTURES

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES IN WHICH THE SPE PURCHASES HIGHLY-RATED ASSETS (SUCH AS

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES) AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE

FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT NOT HELD BY THE SPE.

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES ARE ISSUED BY THE SPE TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE

REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE INVESTORS IN THE SPE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

AGGREGATE ASSETS HELD BY THE CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES WERE $7.9 BILLION.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE STRUCTURES, ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS, VEHICLES IN

WHICH THE FIRM TRANSFERS THE RISKS AND RETURNS OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE SPE,

TYPICALLY DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, TO CLIENTS THROUGH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THE FIRMS NET EXPOSURE ARISING FROM THESE INTERMEDIATION TRANSACTIONS IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT. THE AGGREGATE ASSETS HELD BY THESE CLIENT INTERMEDIATION VEHICLES

WERE $7.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE FIRMS CURRENT EXPOSURE TO ALL OF

THESE VEHICLES IS REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN TRADING ASSETS OR

TRADING LIABILITIES AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN TRADING

REVENUE.

FINALLY, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES STRUCTURED BY OTHER

PARTIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN.

THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT

DECISIONS ARE BASED UPON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC SPE, TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. TYPICALLY, THE FIRM WOULD

NOT BE THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO A THIRD-PARTY SPE. JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS

AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. FOR

EXAMPLE, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED IN NOTE

3, WHEREAS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 29. FEES RECEIVED WHEN THE FIRM

OPERATES IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY, SUCH AS UNDERWRITER, TRUSTEE OR

CUSTODIAN, ARE RECORDED IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46. ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE ASSESSED FOR

CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46 ARE TYPICALLY SPES, ALTHOUGH OTHER NON-SPE-TYPE

ENTITIES MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE GUIDANCE. FIN 46 REQUIRES A VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITY TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY A COMPANY IF THAT COMPANY WILL ABSORB A

MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES, WILL RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED

RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. TRANSFERORS TO A QSPE, WHICH REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF

THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, AND CERTAIN OTHER

INTERESTS IN A QSPE, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 46. THE FIRM IS

REQUIRED TO APPLY FIN 46 FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED OR MODIFIED

AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS AN INTEREST. FOR VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46

ARE EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED THAT DO NOT MEET THE

QSPE CRITERIA PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND THE CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION VEHICLES DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE FIRM IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH OTHER

ENTITIES THAT COULD BE DEEMED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND, THEREFORE, COULD

BE SUBJECT TO FIN 46. THESE ENTITIES WOULD INCLUDE CERTAIN MAJORITY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARIES REPORTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRM IS ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF FIN 46 ON ALL VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

WITH WHICH IT IS INVOLVED. THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, WHICH HAVE $17.5 BILLION

OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, WOULD, IN THEIR

CURRENT FORM, BE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET WHEN

FIN 46 IS IMPLEMENTED. THE FIRM IS ANALYZING RESTRUCTURING OPTIONS FOR THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. BASED UPON ITS CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF FIN 46, THE

FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VEHICLES

RELATED TO THE CREDIT-LINKED NOTES OR THE CLIENT INTERMEDIATION TRANSACTIONS

(WITH ASSETS OF $7.9 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002). MANAGEMENT IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE POSSIBLE CONSOLIDATION OF OTHER

ENTITIES THAT COULD BE DEEMED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE

STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES. AT THIS TIME, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, EARNINGS OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

NOTE 12 MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

(MSRS),WHICH REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING

PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX AND

INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND

EXECUTING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL

AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. MSRS

ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION

OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

THE AMOUNT CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE NET

CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED FOR PERFORMING THE SERVICING ACTIVITIES. MSR

FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL THAT

CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES AND

MANAGEMENTS ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE

CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES, THE COST TO SERVICE THE MORTGAGE LOANS, AS

WELL AS OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. MANAGEMENT USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE

FAIR VALUE. SINCE MANY ECONOMIC FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR

VALUE OF MSRS, THE FIRM PERIODICALLY ASSESSES THE ASSUMPTIONS AND MODELING

TECHNIQUES USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS MSRS.

MSRS ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME RECEIVED IN

PROPORTION TO, AND OVER THE PERIOD OF, THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SERVICING

INCOME STREAM OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS. FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND

MEASURING IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIES ITS PORTFOLIO ON THE BASIS OF

THE PREDOMINANT RISK CHARACTERISTICS: LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST RATE. ANY

INDICATED IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE THROUGH A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL

STRATUM EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING

THEIR EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. THE FIRM OFFSETS THIS INTEREST RATE RISK BY

DESIGNATING CERTAIN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES (E.G., A COMBINATION OF SWAPS,

SWAPTIONS AND FLOORS THAT PRODUCES AN INTEREST RATE PROFILE OPPOSITE TO THE

MSRS) AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF SPECIFIED MSRS UNDER SFAS 133. SFAS 133 HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ALLOWS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED MSRS TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH

EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES

IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS. BOTH OF THESE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN THE MORTGAGE SERVICING FEES COMPONENT WITHIN FEES AND COMMISSIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE

NOTE 28 ON PAGES 101 AND 102.

AFS SECURITIES AND CERTAIN NONHEDGE DERIVATIVES ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE

RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS STAND-ALONE

INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE AFS SECURITIES DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133, AND

THE DERIVATIVES HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED BY MANAGEMENT AS HEDGING DERIVATIVES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AFS SECURITIES UNDER SFAS 115

AND THE NONHEDGE DERIVATIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS TRADING DERIVATIVES.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE AFS SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN

SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES); GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE NONHEDGE DERIVATIVES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN TRADING REVENUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS

SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES REGARDING MSRS, SEE THE CHASE FINANCIAL

SERVICES SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 35 AND 36.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE

USED WITH CAUTION. AS THE FIGURES INDICATE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON A

10% AND 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED

BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A

PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING

ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES

IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF

MSRS EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ARE

THE RESULT OF THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT OR THE RECOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY

RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE

PERIOD. THE CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MSRS FOR THE DATES INDICATED

NOTE 13 PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY HELD BY JPMORGAN PARTNERS (JPMP),

THE FIRMS GLOBAL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

JPMPS BUSINESS. PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT

COMPANY GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY JPMP, ARE CARRIED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS HELD BY JPMP ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET AT THE

QUOTED PUBLIC VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS,

JPMP INCORPORATES THE USE OF LIQUIDITY DISCOUNTS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT

THAT IT CANNOT IMMEDIATELY REALIZE OR HEDGE THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUES AS A

RESULT OF REGULATORY, CORPORATE AND/OR CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

ON THESE HOLDINGS. PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED BASED ON COST. THE

CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY

CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY JPMPS SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF

FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

VALUATIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND CHANGES IN THE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT.

REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN VALUE ARE

REPORTED IN PRIVATE EQUITY REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) AND PRIVATE EQUITY

UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES), RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE GAIN OR LOSS OCCURS.

NOTE 14 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 142, RECLASSIFYING CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM GOODWILL TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THERE WAS NO

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142.

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING

UNIT SEGMENT (WHICH IS ONE LEVEL BELOW THE FIVE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 33 ON PAGE 108). GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY (DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT. OTHER

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, SUCH AS CORE

DEPOSITS AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED PERIODICALLY ON

THESE AMORTIZING INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CAPITALIZED MSRS, SEE

AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 142, GOODWILL INCREASED DURING 2002

BY $63 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES BY

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES. GOODWILL WAS ALSO REDUCED DURING THE YEAR BY

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DURING 2002. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE FIRM HAD GOODWILL OF $8,096 MILLION. GOODWILL BY BUSINESS SEGMENT IS AS

FOLLOWS: INVESTMENT BANK, $2,051 MILLION; INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE

BANKING, $4,165 MILLION; TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES, $996 MILLION; JPMORGAN

PARTNERS, $377 MILLION AND CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES, $507 MILLION.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIP

INTANGIBLES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1,030 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

ACQUISITION OF PROVIDIAN INTANGIBLES, WHICH HAVE AN ESTIMATED LIFE OF SEVEN

YEARS. IN ADDITION, OTHER INTANGIBLES, PRIMARILY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OTHER

THAN CREDIT CARD, INCREASED BY $72 MILLION. ALL OF THE FIRMS ACQUIRED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS $323 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT

INCLUDED A $12 MILLION IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN ON PURCHASED CREDIT CARD

RELATIONSHIPS RELATED TO A SMALL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO THAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED

COMPUTES DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIFE OF AN ASSET. FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THE FIRM USES THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE LESSER OF THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASED FACILITY OR THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT. JPMORGAN CHASE CAPITALIZES CERTAIN

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS

5.51% AND 5.12% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO

MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, JPMORGAN

CHASE UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF ITS DEBT

ISSUES. THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS INTEREST EXPENSE ON

THE ASSOCIATED DEBT. THE MODIFIED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL

LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WAS

3.42% AND 4.64% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BOTH

LONG-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES SOLD AS PART OF THE FIRMS TRADING

NOTE 20 EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

(EPS) IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. BASIC EPS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME

APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHOD AS

BASIC EPS, BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING REFLECT THE

POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES OR OTHER

CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED INTO COMMON STOCK.

NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME COMPUTATION FOR BASIC EPS AND

DILUTED EPS AS JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, AND, THEREFORE, NO

ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK WERE NECESSARY.

NOTE 22 INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD REQUIRED

BY SFAS 109 TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED

BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE

UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE TO BE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES

EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT

EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO

THE AMOUNT JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE REALIZED.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECTS OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, SFAS 133 HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH JPMORGAN CHASES EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. THE TAX EFFECT OF THESE

ITEMS IS RECORDED DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

DECREASED BY $1.1 BILLION AND $281 MILLION IN 2002 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, AND

INCREASED BY $541 MILLION IN 2001 AS A RESULT OF THESE TAX EFFECTS.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS

OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES TO THE EXTENT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN

REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. FOR 2002, SUCH EARNINGS

APPROXIMATED $274 MILLION ON A PRETAX BASIS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED

$1.9 BILLION. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX

LIABILITY THAT WOULD RESULT UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS.

THE TAX EXPENSE APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2002,

2001 AND 2000 WAS $531 MILLION, $286 MILLION AND $78 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES

DEFINED BENEFITS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A

CASH BALANCE DEFINED BENEFIT FORMULA IN THE FORM OF SERVICE AND INTEREST

CREDITS IN DETERMINING THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT BASED ON

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN

BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE AND BENEFITS VEST AFTER FIVE

THE PRIOR PLANS OF CHASE AND J.P. MORGAN WERE MERGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001.

FOR J.P. MORGAN EMPLOYEES WHO WERE EARNING BENEFITS UNDER A PRIOR PLAN FORMULA

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1998, THE PLAN ALSO PROVIDES A MINIMUM BENEFIT BASED ON

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE FIRM

ALSO OFFERS DEFINED BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS BASED ON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRMS

SFAS 88.

IT IS JPMORGAN CHASES POLICY TO FUND ITS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT

TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS.

IN 2002, THE FIRM MADE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $1.2 BILLION TO FUND FULLY

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE U.S. AND CERTAIN NON-U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. ON FEBRUARY 10, 2003, THE FIRM MADE

AN ADDITIONAL CASH CONTRIBUTION OF $127 MILLION TO FUND FULLY THE U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN TO ITS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE FOLLOWING THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRMS U.S. PENSION

ASSETS ARE HELD IN A TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY, FIXED INCOME, CASH

EQUIVALENT AND OTHER SECURITIES. U.S. PENSION ASSETS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN

CHASE COMMON STOCK EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY

STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

THE FIRM OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO

QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF SERVICE AND DATE

OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON JPMORGAN CHASES SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL

BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE CONTRIBUTORY, WHILE THE LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE ALSO OFFERED

TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES. THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 106.

J.P. MORGAN

CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION IS PARTIALLY FUNDED

WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. ASSETS OF THE COLI POLICIES ARE HELD IN SEPARATE

ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITIES, BONDS AND

OTHER DEBT SECURITIES. WHILE JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI

PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY

TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUALIZED ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31.

WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE

ASSUMED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN AN

INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION IN 2003 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES. A 25BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE

FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2003 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN

THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION. THESE INCREASES

WOULD BE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF A SIMILAR REDUCTION IN THE ASSUMED

INTEREST RATE USED FOR CREDITING PARTICIPANT BALANCES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS (I.E., U.S.

PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT).

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, WHERE

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN SERVICE CREDITS ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE

MAXIMUM LIMITATION STIPULATED BY LAW. THIS PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED

NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION PLAN AND IS UNFUNDED. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED

TO THE FIRMS OTHER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TOTALED $15 MILLION IN 2002,

$22 MILLION IN 2001 AND $22 MILLION IN 2000.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASES ASSUMED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE MEDICAL

BENEFITS COST TREND RATE USED TO MEASURE THE EXPECTED COST OF BENEFITS COVERED

WAS 10.0% FOR 2002, DECLINING GRADUALLY OVER EIGHT YEARS TO A FLOOR OF 5.0%.

THE EFFECT OF A 1% CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED MEDICAL COST TREND RATE WOULD RESULT

IN A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN THE DECEMBER 31, 2002 BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND 2002

PERIODIC EXPENSE BY UP TO 4.4%.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND

CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE 401(K)

SAVINGS PLAN COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN ALLOWS

EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM MATCHES THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTIONS DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR UP TO A CERTAIN

PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND LEGAL

LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING ONE

YEAR OF SERVICE AND BENEFITS VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRMS

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE PLANS TOTALED $251

MILLION IN 2002, $208 MILLION IN 2001 AND $213 MILLION IN 2000.

NOTE 24 EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD IN ACCORDANCE

WITH APB 25. THERE IS NO EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS AS THEY WERE

GRANTED AT THE STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE AND, THEREFORE, THEY HAVE NO

INTRINSIC VALUE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS)

IS MEASURED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND THE STOCK PRICE AT THE

GRANT DATE AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD. EFFECTIVE JANUARY

1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL ADOPT SFAS 123 USING THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION

METHOD. SFAS 123 REQUIRES ALL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK

OPTIONS, TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION

METHOD, ALL NEW AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003 WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. AWARDS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IF NOT

SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25. FAIR VALUE

WILL BE BASED ON A BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL WITH COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS123, WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2003, WILL REDUCE THE FIRMS NET INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $0.08 PER SHARE IN 2003.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE

UNDER JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS (INCLUDING SHARES

AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE TO NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS). THE FIRM IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO

DIRECTORS.

KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES UNDER TWO PLANS (THE LTI PLANS): THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN,

APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN MAY 2000, PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS,

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSU AWARDS, AND THE

STOCK OPTION PLAN, A NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN, PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS AND SARS. SARS HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED UNDER EITHER OF THESE PLANS.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. GENERALLY, OPTIONS

CANNOT BE EXERCISED UNTIL AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND BECOME

EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT.

OPTIONS GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

IN JANUARY 2001, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED 82.2 MILLION OPTIONS UNDER THE LTI

PLANS PURSUANT TO A GROWTH PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM (GPIP). THE EXERCISE

PRICE OF ALL GPIP AWARDS IS $51.22, THE PRICE OF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK

ON THE GRANT DATE. BECAUSE THE CORPORATE AND BUSINESS UNIT PERFORMANCE GOALS

FOR THIS AWARD WERE NOT ACHIEVED, THESE OPTIONS WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE IN

JANUARY 2007, AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. FORFEITURES OF

GPIP OPTIONS AGGREGATED 14.9 MILLION SHARES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS ARE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER THE LTI PLANS AT

NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT. RESTRICTED STOCK/RSUS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL

CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED, INCLUDING CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR A

SPECIFIED PERIOD. THE RECIPIENT OF A SHARE OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO

VOTING RIGHTS AND DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK. AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT

TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AFTER THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE; THE

RECIPIENT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO DIVIDENDS ON THE

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING.

DURING 2002, 24.0 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK/RSU AWARDS (ALL PAYABLE SOLELY IN

STOCK) WERE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER THE LTI PLANS. IN 2001 AND 2000,

25.9 MILLION AND 36.1 MILLION AWARDS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE GRANTED UNDER THESE

PLANS. THE 2001 AND 2000 GRANTS EACH INCLUDED 1.3 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK/RSU

AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITABLE. THE VESTING OF THESE AWARDS IS CONDITIONED UPON

CERTAIN VESTING PERIODS BEING MET AND JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE

REACHING AND SUSTAINING TARGET PRICES WITHIN A FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FORFEITABLE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE DESIGNATED

PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND MEASURED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND THE

TARGET STOCK PRICE. IF THE TARGET STOCK PRICE IS ACHIEVED, THEN ANY

UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNT IS RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR

OVER THE REMAINING MINIMUM REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD IF THE TARGET STOCK PRICE IS

ACHIEVED PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF SUCH PERIOD. THE 2001, 2000 AND 1999

FORFEITABLE AWARDS HAVE NOT VESTED AS THE TARGET STOCK PRICES HAVE NOT BEEN

ACHIEVED. SEE COMPARISON OF THE FAIR AND INTRINSIC VALUE MEASUREMENT METHODS ON

THE FOLLOWING PAGE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE REVERSAL OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO THESE FORFEITABLE AWARDS.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

A PORTION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THAT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED

LEVELS IS AWARDED IN RESTRICTED STOCK OR RSU AWARDS (THE REQUIRED DEFERRAL

PLAN) ISSUED UNDER THE LTI PLANS. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK/RSU AWARDS VEST

SOLELY BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. DURING 2001 AND 2000, 137,500 AND

160,000, RESPECTIVELY, OF SUCH AWARDS WERE GRANTED. THE REQUIRED DEFERRAL PLAN

WAS DISCONTINUED IN 2002.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN JANUARY 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED 32.6 MILLION OPTIONS TO ALL ELIGIBLE

FULL-TIME (375 OPTIONS EACH) AND PART-TIME (188 OPTIONS EACH) EMPLOYEES UNDER

THE VALUE SHARING PLAN, A NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN. THIS AWARD IS THE THIRD

OF THREE EQUAL ANNUAL GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. THE EXERCISE PRICE

FOR EACH ANNUAL GRANT IS EQUAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE

RESPECTIVE GRANT DATE. THE OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE AFTER FIVE YEARS, OR

EARLIER IF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE REACHES AND SUSTAINS A TARGET

PRICE FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD. OPTIONS GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT

DATE. THE 2002, 2001 AND 2000 GRANTS HAVE NOT VESTED AS THE TARGET STOCK PRICES

HAVE NOT BEEN ACHIEVED.

AWARDS GRANTED IN 1999, 2000 AND 2001. DURING 2002, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT

WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE TARGET STOCK PRICES WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITHIN

THEIR RESPECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIODS. THE TARGET STOCK PRICES FOR THESE

FORFEITABLE AWARDS RANGED FROM $73.33 TO $85.00.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS NET INCOME AND BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE AS REPORTED AND AFTER THE IMPACT OF APPLYING SFAS 123. THE INCREASE IN

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AFTER APPLYING SFAS 123 IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 REFLECTS

EXPENSE RELATED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN PRIOR YEARS THAT ARE

NOT FULLY VESTED. THIS INCREASE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2002. THE HIGHER

EXPENSE FROM APPLYING SFAS 123 IN 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 RESULTS FROM THE

INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2001.

NOTE 25 RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FRB) REQUIRES

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.

THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BANK

SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION

IN 2002 AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2001.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE

SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED LOANS TO JPMORGAN CHASE OR TO OTHER

AFFILIATES GENERALLY ARE LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL

CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE

AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL

CAPITAL. JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS AFFILIATES WERE WELL WITHIN THESE LIMITS

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY

BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE OTHER

BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND

RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE FRB, THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS

OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE

IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2003 AND 2002, JPMORGAN CHASES BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN

THE AGGREGATE, $1.3 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR

RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. DIVIDEND CAPACITY IN 2003 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

THE BANKS EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S.

REGULATORS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.1

BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND SECURITIES WITH A MARKET VALUE OF

$3.0 BILLION AND $4.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK

ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 26 CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: CORE CAPITAL (REFERRED TO AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL) AND SUPPLEMENTARY CAPITAL (REFERRED TO AS TIER 2 CAPITAL). TIER

1 CAPITAL INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND

MINORITY INTEREST LESS GOODWILL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS

OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1, LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER

INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP

TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, LESS INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FRB, JPMORGAN

CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS

TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM

REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FRB. BANK SUBSIDIARIES ALSO

ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY

REGULATORS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE

MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH IT WAS SUBJECT AND IS NOT AWARE OF ANY

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THAT WOULD ALTER THIS CLASSIFICATION.

THE FIRM ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $900 MILLION RELATED TO COSTS ANTICIPATED TO

BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE VARIOUS PRIVATE LITIGATIONS AND REGULATORY

INQUIRIES INVOLVING ENRON CORP. (ENRON) AND THE OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS

IN WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED. THIS RESERVE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL, OF THE CURRENT PROBABLE

AGGREGATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MATTERS. OF THE $900 MILLION, $600

MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH ENRON. THE BALANCE OF $300 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE

VARIOUS MATERIAL LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE

FIRMS DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES AND EQUITY RESEARCH PRACTICES,

AND INCLUDES $80 MILLION RELATING TO THE FIRMS SETTLEMENT IN DECEMBER 2002

WITH VARIOUS REGULATORS RELATING TO EQUITY RESEARCH PRACTICES. IT IS POSSIBLE

THAT THE RESERVE COULD BE SUBJECT TO REVISION IN THE FUTURE.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE

RESERVE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR

WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OR INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

PARTIES, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE

PENDING MATTERS (INCLUDING THE PENDING MATERIAL MATTERS AS TO WHICH THE RESERVE

HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED) WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF

THESE MATTERS WILL BE, OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER

WILL BE. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING CAVEAT, JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES, BASED

UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED $900 MILLION RESERVE, THAT

THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY

PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM, ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR PROCEEDING OR THE IMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR FINE OR PENALTY MAY BE

MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD

DEPENDING UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY AND THE

LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

NOTE 28 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

SFAS 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, USED

FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. ALL DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR

HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON

WHETHER THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

THE MAJORITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING

PURPOSES. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVES AS AN END USER TO HEDGE MARKET

EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. BOTH TRADING AND

END-USER DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING

LIABILITIES.

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES MUST BE CONSIDERED TO

BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING

HEDGED. EACH DERIVATIVE MUST BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF

THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR THE HEDGE, INCLUDING

IDENTIFICATION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK

EXPOSURE, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND

RETROSPECTIVELY.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM ARE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF

THE ITEM AND IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING

CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH

THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY, WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS OCCUR. FOR HEDGE

RELATIONSHIPS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED

TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE OR THE REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT

INSTRUMENT ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

101

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO./2002 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE

LONG-TERM DEBT, LOANS, AFS SECURITIES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED TO MODIFY

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK BY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TO A FLOATING RATE. INTEREST RATE OPTIONS AND SWAPTIONS ARE ALSO USED IN

COMBINATION WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. ALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS

CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST

INCOME, FEES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER REVENUE. JPMORGAN CHASE DID NOT

RECOGNIZE ANY GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2002 ON FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER

QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ANTICIPATED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

FUTURES, OPTIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS ARE THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS

USED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON

FUTURE EARNINGS. ALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE

CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASE PRIMARILY USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS NET

INVESTMENTS IN ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE PORTION OF

THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

(FORWARD POINTS) IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

AND BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

IN 2001, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX REDUCTION TO NET

INCOME OF $25 MILLION AND AN AFTER-TAX REDUCTION TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

OF $36 MILLION. THE IMPACT OF RECLASSIFYING CERTAIN SFAS 115 SECURITIES FROM

AFS TO TRADING WAS NOT MATERIAL AT THE ADOPTION DATE. DUE TO SFAS 133, JPMORGAN

CHASE CHANGED CERTAIN HEDGING STRATEGIES AND ELECTED NOT TO DESIGNATE SOME

DERIVATIVES UTILIZED TO MANAGE ECONOMIC EXPOSURE AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. FOR

EXAMPLE, TO MODERATE ITS USE OF DERIVATIVES, THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS BEGAN USING

AFS SECURITIES AS ECONOMIC HEDGES OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE DUE TO OPERATIONAL

AND COST CONSTRAINTS OF APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS

CREDIT RISK ARE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN

QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133, DERIVATIVES USED FOR HEDGING PURPOSES

GENERALLY WERE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES WERE DEFERRED ON THOSE CONTRACTS.

NOTE 29 OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G.,

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW DOWN THE COMMITMENT OR THE

FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY

SUBSEQUENTLY FAILS TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF

THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT

BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS

NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT

EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF

THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN COMMERCIAL-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 10 FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

102

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 45, WHICH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO DISCLOSE

INFORMATION ABOUT OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS. FIN 45

DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A

GUARANTEED PARTY BASED ON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY, OR

EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY, OR (B) A THIRD PARTYS FAILURE TO

PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45: CERTAIN

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS; STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES;

AND SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND ONLY WHEN A

CUSTOMER HAS COMPLIED WITH PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS, AND THEY GENERALLY EXPIRE

ON FIXED DATES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

INCLUDES $213 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, RELATED TO UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO

EXTEND CREDIT. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT

GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF $36

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PRIMARILY USED AS A

MECHANISM TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO SPES. OF THE $36 BILLION OF ASSET PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, $33 BILLION RELATED TO THE FIRMS MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS AND STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11.

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS CAN BE EXERCISED AT ANYTIME BY THE SPES

ADMINISTRATOR, WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE A TRIGGERING EVENT TO OCCUR. TRIGGERING

EVENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A NEED FOR LIQUIDITY, A MARKET VALUE

DECLINE OF THE ASSETS OR DOWNGRADE IN THE RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THESE

AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT

ABOVE THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT, PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL

VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN MOST

INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS

POTENTIAL LOSSES ON THESE AGREEMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS WAS NOT MATERIAL AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING

COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER

TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER

FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. MORE THAN 90% OF THESE

ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE FIRM TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO

RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE GUARANTEES; IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM MAY HOLD CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THESE

GUARANTEES. COLLATERAL HELD AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 RELATING TO THESE ARRANGEMENTS WAS $8

BILLION. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

INCLUDED $150 MILLION RELATED TO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL

GUARANTEES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HOLDS CUSTOMERS SECURITIES UNDER CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS. AT

TIMES, THESE SECURITIES ARE LOANED TO THIRD PARTIES, AND THE FIRM ISSUES

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS TO THE CUSTOMER THAT PROTECT THE

CUSTOMER AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSS IF THE THIRD PARTY FAILS TO RETURN THE

SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE

GENERALLY OBTAINS FROM THE THIRD PARTY CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL

WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FIRM HELD $110 BILLION IN COLLATERAL IN SUPPORT OF THESE

AGREEMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A

PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE

INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES, THE CONTRACT MAY ALSO

INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT

AT ITS FAIR VALUE, THUS NOT REQUIRING THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT UNDER THE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TERMINATION CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT EXPECT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER

INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD

PARTY PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES THAT THIRD PARTY FOR LOSSES THEY MAY

INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS

SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND FUTURE

CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER,

BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE

REMOTE.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT

REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE

BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES THAT EFFECTIVELY

GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON A COUNTER-PARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. THE

TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES

WAS $47 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE FIRM REDUCES ITS EXPOSURES TO THESE

CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS OR BY ENTERING INTO

CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUE

RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OF $141 MILLION AND A

DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $814 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH

SETTLEMENT AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR THE BUYER OF CREDIT

PROTECTION TO OWN THE REFERENCE ASSET. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE

CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES AS DESCRIBED IN FIN 45.

NOTE 30 CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN

SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR

HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT RISK PORTFOLIO

TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED

NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE

PRIMARILY EVALUATED BY INDUSTRY, AND ALSO BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE PRIMARILY EVALUATED BY PRODUCT, AND BY U.S.

GEOGRAPHIC REGION.

NOTE 31 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE VALUE AT WHICH POSITIONS COULD BE CLOSED OUT OR

SOLD IN A TRANSACTION WITH A WILLING AND KNOWLEDGEABLE COUNTERPARTY OVER A

PERIOD OF TIME CONSISTENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING OR INVESTMENT STRATEGY.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY MAY DIFFER BASED ON THE TYPE OF

INSTRUMENT AND/OR ITS USE IN A TRADING OR INVESTING STRATEGY. GENERALLY, THE

MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK RECORDED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME;



RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY AND AS PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME;



RECORDED AT COST (LESS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE NOT RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES THERETO; OR



RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES

OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS

THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENT INFORMATION AS INPUTS. PRIMARY

MARKET PRICES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, AS THEY

PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF PRICES AT WHICH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD

CURRENTLY BE ORIGINATED.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE, AT TIMES, BASED ON DEFINED METHODOLOGIES THAT

ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME AND THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT

POSITIONS ARE CARRIED AT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUIDITY AND

CONCENTRATION CONCERNS, AND ONGOING SERVICING COSTS. JPMORGAN

CHASES VALUA-

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2002 ANNUAL REPORT

104

TION PROCESS IS CONTINUALLY SUBJECT TO REVIEW, WHICH INCLUDES VALUATION MODEL

AND METHODOLOGY REVIEWS AND PRICE TESTING WITH INDEPENDENT SOURCES WHERE

APPROPRIATE.

THESE METHODS MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE

OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, THE

USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR SECONDARY MARKET PRICES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE; FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS, RATHER THAN DISCOUNTING THEM USING PRIMARY MARKET RATES. FOLLOWING

SUCH AN APPROACH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL LOANS WOULD

APPROXIMATE CARRYING VALUE (I.E., COMMERCIAL LOANS NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOLLOWING THE SAME APPROACH, THE MAXIMUM

INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS OF THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF THESE COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS 107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY

SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE.

FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS

CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND ITS CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS IN THE AGGREGATE ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING CAPTIONS DESCRIBE THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED, BY

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT COST, INCLUDING CASH AND DUE

FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES

AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE ARE CONSIDERED TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT

RISK.

ASSETS WHERE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS FROM COST

JPMORGAN CHASES DEBT, EQUITY AND DERIVATIVE TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT

THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHEN AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING INSTRUMENTS. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE

NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING MODELS, QUOTED

PRICES OF INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE

TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM

ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED

MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH FLOWS ARE

DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

SECURITIES

FAIR VALUES OF ACTIVELY-TRADED SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE SECONDARY

MARKET, WHILE THE FAIR VALUES FOR NONACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE BASED ON

INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE FOR DERIVATIVES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING.



POSITION VALUATION PRINCIPALLY BASED ON LIQUID MARKET PRICING AS

EVIDENCED BY EXCHANGE TRADED PRICES, BROKER-DEALER QUOTATIONS OR RELATED

INPUT FACTORS WHICH ASSUME ALL COUNTER-PARTIES HAVE THE SAME CREDIT

RATING;



ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESULTING PORTFOLIO VALUATION TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES THAT ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON MARKET PRICES FOR CREDIT RISK; AND



OTHER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LIQUIDITY, TRANSACTION HEDGING COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS.

LOANS

FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS IS DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES SUITABLE FOR EACH TYPE

OF LOAN.



FAIR VALUE FOR THE COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT

OF THE TWO MAIN RISK COMPONENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO: CREDIT AND INTEREST. THE

ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING A PRIMARY MARKET RATE

APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES AND THEN ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE INHERENT CREDIT RISK.



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTO FINANCINGS)

AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES FOR WHICH MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE

READILY AVAILABLE ARE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, ADJUSTED FOR

PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE

CURRENT RATES OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS. FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES,

SECONDARY MARKET YIELDS FOR COMPARABLE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

ADJUSTED FOR RISK, ARE USED.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED ON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES SINCE THE ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK.



THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS IS

GENERALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND PRICES OF SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. OTHERWISE, IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FAIR

VALUE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK THAT

IS DISCOUNTED USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT INCORPORATES

THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

OTHER ASSETS

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MSRS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGE 88.

FAIR VALUE FOR MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE

CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DELINQUENCY RATES, ANCILLARY REVENUES AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REVIEWS SUCH ASSUMPTIONS AGAINST MARKET COMPARABLES,

IF AVAILABLE.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSED FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO

STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE

EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF

THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND

ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS CONSIDERED TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING

VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS ARE ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING CASH

FLOWS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF FUNDS HAVING SIMILAR INTEREST RATES

AND SIMILAR MATURITIES.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE

TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM

ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS WITH

LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE

CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE

MATURITY.

LONG-TERM DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES, IS

BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT

QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED ON

THE PRIMARY MARKET PRICES TO ORIGINATE NEW COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. IT

IS THE CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES RELATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL PRICES

THAT PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS

BASIS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS APPROXIMATED

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OF $363 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES VALUED UNDER SFAS 107. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN

NOTE 33 SEGMENT INFORMATION

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE MAJOR BUSINESSES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE

SEGMENTED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER

SERVED, AND REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS EVALUATED BY

MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED (SVA) AND OPERATING EARNINGS AS

ITS PRINCIPAL MEASURES OF SEGMENT PROFITABILITY. FOR A DEFINITION OF THESE

MEASUREMENTS, SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON PAGE 114.

OPERATING REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING THE SEGMENTS OPERATING EARNINGS. GUIDELINES EXIST FOR

ALLOCATING TO THE SEGMENTS EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY INCURRED BY THEM,

SUCH AS CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND TAXES. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT HAS DEVELOPED A

RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL METHODOLOGY THAT QUANTIFIES DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK 

CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY  WITHIN THE

VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND ASSIGNS CAPITAL ACCORDINGLY. EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CREDIT COSTS, INCLUDING ACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS AND CHANGES

IN THE SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE

RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AVAILABLE FOR LOSSES IN

ANY BUSINESS SEGMENT, IS MAINTAINED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL.

A SUMMARY OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS IS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. THE

CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS COLUMN REFLECTS REVENUES AND EXPENSES EXCLUDED FROM

THE DETERMINATION OF THE SEGMENTS OPERATING EARNINGS. THIS COLUMN INCLUDES THE

ACCOUNTING EFFECTS REMAINING AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL AFTER THE APPLICATION OF

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING INCOME TAX EXPENSES (THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO BUSINESS UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASES

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE).

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION CONCERNING JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE

SEGMENT RESULTS IN THE MD&A ON PAGES 24 AND 25. ADDITIONALLY, FINANCIAL

ASSET CAPITAL TAX.

THE CAPITAL THAT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS UNIT BASED ON

THEIR AVERAGE ASSET LEVELS AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT-RELATED

EXPOSURES TO REFLECT THE NEED FOR THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS

TO MEET BANK REGULATORY DEFINITIONS OF WELL CAPITALIZED.

BASIS POINT VALUE (BPV).

THIS MEASUREMENT QUANTIFIES THE CHANGE IN THE MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (THAT ARE NOT PART OF TRADING ACTIVITIES) THAT

WOULD RESULT FROM A ONE-BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES OR ONE BASIS POINT

WIDENING OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS. BPV SHOWS WHETHER AN INCREASE OF 1/100 OF 1%

(OR ONE BASIS POINT) IN A MARKET RATE WILL YIELD A PROFIT OR LOSS, AND OF WHAT

MAGNITUDE.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

ARE CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS THAT PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST A

CREDIT EVENT OF ONE OR MORE REFERENCED CREDITS. THE NATURE OF A CREDIT EVENT IS

ESTABLISHED BY THE PROTECTION BUYER AND PROTECTION SELLER AT THE INCEPTION OF A

TRANSACTION, AND SUCH EVENTS INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY AND FAILURE TO MEET

PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE. THE BUYER OF THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE PAYS A

PERIODIC FEE IN RETURN FOR A PAYMENT BY THE PROTECTION SELLER UPON THE

OCCURRENCE, IF ANY, OF A CREDIT EVENT.

CREDIT RISK.

THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO BORROWER OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

CRITICIZED.

AN INDICATION OF CREDIT QUALITY OF A PORTFOLIO, BASED ON JPMORGAN

CHASES INTERNAL RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. CRITICIZED ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT A RISK PROFILE SIMILAR TO A RATING OF A

CCC+/CAA1 OR LOWER, AS DEFINED BY THE INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES.

CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ARE CONTRACTS THAT INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF

BOTH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS IN TWO DIFFERENT CURRENCIES. ALSO SEE

INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN THIS GLOSSARY.

ARE CONTRACTS FOR THE DELAYED DELIVERY OF

SECURITIES OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. THE SELLING PARTY AGREES TO DELIVER, ON

A SPECIFIED FUTURE DATE, A SPECIFIED INSTRUMENT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE OR YIELD.

INTEREST RATE OPTIONS

, INCLUDING CAPS AND FLOORS, ARE CONTRACTS TO MODIFY

INTEREST RATE RISK IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT OF A PREMIUM WHEN THE CONTRACT

IS INITIATED. A WRITER OF INTEREST RATE OPTIONS RECEIVES A PREMIUM IN EXCHANGE

FOR BEARING THE RISK OF UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. CONVERSELY, A

PURCHASER OF AN OPTION PAYS A PREMIUM FOR THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO

BUY OR SELL A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OR CURRENCY AT PREDETERMINED TERMS IN THE

FUTURE.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ARE CONTRACTS IN WHICH A SERIES OF INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS

IN A SINGLE CURRENCY ARE EXCHANGED OVER A PRESCRIBED PERIOD. AN EXAMPLE OF A

SITUATION IN WHICH AN INTEREST RATE SWAP WOULD BE USED WOULD BE TO CONVERT

FIXED-RATE DEBT TO A VARIABLE RATE. BY ENTERING INTO THE SWAP, THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF THE DEBT WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED, BUT THE INTEREST STREAMS WOULD

CHANGE FROM FIXED TO VARIABLE.

INVESTMENT-GRADE.

AN INDICATION OF CREDIT QUALITY BASED ON JPMORGAN CHASES

INTERNAL RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. INVESTMENT-GRADE REPRESENTS A RISK PROFILE

SIMILAR TO A RATING OF A BBB-/BAA3 OR BETTER, AS DEFINED BY THE INDEPENDENT

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A

CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES

MORTGAGED-BACKED SECURITIES (MBSS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS

(CMOS) ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE

ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A

CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS FOR MBSS AND

LESS THAN ONE YEAR FOR CMOS.

(B)

THE AVERAGE YIELD IS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE

YEAR. YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF

RELATED DERIVATIVES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF

PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(C)

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF STATE AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES

ISSUED BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, CMOS OF PRIVATE

ISSUERS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

(D)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2001,

SEE NOTE 7 ON PAGE 79. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $59,487 MILLION AND $14,079

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WAS $587

MILLION AND $2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN JPMORGAN CHASES

SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS, SECURITIES ISSUED

BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY

EXCEEDED 10% OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

AND HAD AT THAT DATE A FAIR VALUE OF

$7,804 MILLION AND AN AMORTIZED COST OF

$7,772 MILLION. THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND

CERTAIN OF ITS AGENCIES WERE THE ONLY

OTHER ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES EXCEEDED

10% OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING

THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FFIEC REVISED GUIDELINES,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES WERE INCLUDED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE

BEGINNING IN 2000.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN

WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER

OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED 0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED.

THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN EXPOSURES

THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC

AND SEC METHODOLOGIES RELATE TO THE

TREATMENTS OF LOCAL COUNTRY EXPOSURE AND

TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES.

ON NONPERFORMING LOANS ACCORDING TO CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE AMOUNT OF

INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS
