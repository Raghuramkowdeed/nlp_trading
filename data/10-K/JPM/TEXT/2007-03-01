ITEM 1: BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN CHASE IS

ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH $1.4 TRILLION

IN ASSETS, $116 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH BRANCHES IN 17 STATES, AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(CHASE BANK USA, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRMS CREDIT

CARD-ISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMORGAN SECURITIES), ITS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING

FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE

OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

ON JULY 1, 2004, BANK ONE CORPORATION (BANK ONE) MERGED WITH AND INTO

JPMORGAN CHASE (THE MERGER). BANK ONES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2004. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECT SIX MONTHS

OF OPERATIONS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY AND SIX MONTHS OF OPERATIONS

OF THE COMBINED FIRM; RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRIOR TO 2004

REFLECT THE OPERATIONS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES

AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM

10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND

ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A)

OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH

MATERIAL TO, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS

ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHAIRMAN

AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND

OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES,

INTO SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS (INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD

SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT) AND CORPORATE, WHICH INCLUDES ITS PRIVATE EQUITY AND TREASURY

BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS CORPORATE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A), BEGINNING ON PAGE 34,

AND IN NOTE 33 ON PAGE 139.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL

FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE

FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES,

E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH THESE OTHER FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITY AND RANGE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES OFFERED AND THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRA-

PHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN

CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A

REGIONAL BASIS. JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS UPON

THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE

FEATURES OF ITS PRODUCTS APPEAL TO CUSTOMERS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS ABLE TO MEET ITS CLIENTS OBJECTIVES OR NEEDS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS UPON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL

AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED

TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE

GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMPETITION WILL

BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO COMPETE WITH OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY BE LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR THAT MAY

HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

CERTAIN RISKS RELATING TO THE FIRMS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, SEE THE RISK

FACTORS ON PAGE 4.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER

STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS

AMENDED (THE BHCA). JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA).

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD), IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR

MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE

CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A

SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE

PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND CRA

REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS

SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN

UMBRELLA REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED UPON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

(OCC). SEE OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

BELOW FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO

WHICH THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT.

1

PART I

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

BY THE SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE THAT ARE NATIONAL BANKS. NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES

OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

THAT MAY BE PAID BY NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND

CHASE BANK USA, N.A., IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT

EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A

DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED

NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE

APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID

IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE NOTE 25 ON PAGE 129 FOR THE

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT

JANUARY 1, 2007 AND 2006, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE

APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE FDIC) HAVE

AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING

COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND

WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL

AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET

CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER

LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING

GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL

AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF

TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER

THE GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL

RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO

GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE TOTAL

ASSETS (NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, GOODWILL AND CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR

WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO

MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR

PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. SEE REGULATORY

CAPITAL ON PAGE 58 AND NOTE 26 ON PAGE 129.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK, CERTAIN RISKS ARISING FROM NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, AND

THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RISKS AS IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING

AN INSTITUTIONS OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY. OTHER FACTORS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

BY FEDERAL REGULATORS INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE; LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND

MARKET RISK; THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS; THE QUALITY OF LOANS AND

INVESTMENTS; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LOAN AND INVESTMENT POLICIES; AND

MANAGEMENTS OVERALL ABILITY TO MONITOR AND CONTROL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL

RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS PRESENTED BY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES

INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY

ACTIVITIES AND IN THE TRADING OF DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE MARKET

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RULES REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WITH LARGE TRADING

ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE) TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK IN

AN AMOUNT CALCULATED BY USING THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OWN INTERNAL

VALUE-AT-RISK MODELS (SUBJECT TO PARAMETERS SET BY THE REGULATORS).

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING

AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING

SUPERVISION. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD

(BASEL II). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING THE BASEL

II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. JPMORGAN

CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN THE

U.S., COMMENCING IN 2009, BY EMPLOYING INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK

DRIVERS TO DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW

BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS U.S.

BANK SUPERVISORS THAT ITS INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY STANDARDS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED

TIMELINES WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES. DURING 2007 AND 2008, THE FIRM WILL

ADOPT BASEL II RULES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF

1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES,

INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS; AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL

BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS

CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES. THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE; HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO

AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS

COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE FDIC ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS, AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2005, BY

WHICH THE FDIC ESTABLISHED A NEW BASE RATE SCHEDULE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF

DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SET NEW ASSESSMENT RATES WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2007. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

ASSIGNED TO A RISK CATEGORY BASED UPON CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES.

DEPENDING UPON THE RISK CATEGORY TO WHICH IT IS ASSIGNED, THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

IS THEN ASSESSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS BASED UPON ITS DEPOSITS. SOME DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ARE ENTITLED TO APPLY AGAINST THESE PREMIUMS A CREDIT THAT

IS DESIGNED TO GIVE EFFECT TO PREMIUM PAYMENTS, IF ANY, THAT THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION MAY HAVE MADE IN CERTAIN PRIOR YEARS. THE NEW ASSESSMENT

SCHEDULE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS EARNINGS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

2

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS

INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER

FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING

IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE

LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE

POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO

A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2)

TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR

TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC

TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED

BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO

INVESTORS (REFERENCED BELOW AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES

(INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE

CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTE-HOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR

OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD

EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OR DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. OR CHASE BANK USA, N.A., SUCH

PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT, WHICH WAS AMENDED BY THE

USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001, REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, TO ESTABLISH

CERTAIN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. THE

ACT ALSO REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS

FOR NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS, OR PERSONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PRIVATE BANKING FOR

NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE, SPECIFIC AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND REPORT

INSTANCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING THROUGH THOSE ACCOUNTS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO

ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES

IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER,

BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT.

IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE

OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE

DIVESTITURE.

ANY LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE

SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF

THE SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY

COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCY TO

MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK AT A CERTAIN LEVEL WOULD BE ASSUMED BY

THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS

WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR

SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT

JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SEE NOTE 25 ON PAGE 129.

THE FIRMS BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME

OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN

CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND

CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN

CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND

CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS SECURITIES

UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES THROUGH JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND

OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF

THE SEC AND THE NASD REGULATION, INC. (NASD) AND OTHER SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS (SROS).

JPMORGAN SECURITIES IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE).

THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION

BY THE SEC. THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN

THE U.S. AND ABROAD. ONE SUBSIDIARY IS REGISTERED AS A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND

COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS, ALL WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING

COMMISSION (CFTC). THESE CFTC-REGISTERED SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF

THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRMS ENERGY BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES

IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER

LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE

TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR

DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACTS, AS WELL

AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING, ENFORCEMENT AND

COLLECTION OF CONSUMER LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT NEED TO BE

MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOANS.

PART I

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS

THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO (1) THE

SHARING OF NONPUBLIC

CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS; AND

(2) THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL

CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT

OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET

FORTH IN GLBA.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS RELATING TO THE FIRMS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, SEE RISK FACTORS BELOW.

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

FOR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF TOTAL REVENUE, TOTAL EXPENSE, INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND NET INCOME, SEE NOTE 32 ON PAGE 138. FOR INFORMATION

REGARDING NON-U.S. LOANS, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGE 112 AND THE SECTIONS ENTITLED

EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE IN THE MD&A ON PAGE 72, LOAN PORTFOLIO ON PAGE 154 AND

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS ON PAGE 155.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT

COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 147. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN THE

MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER OF THE FIRMS REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED WITH

THE SEC ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS OR RESULTS. THE READER

SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL

POTENTIAL RISKS THAT MAY FACE THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. FACTORS

SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF

EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; INFLATION; AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT CAN AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE ACTIVITY

LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO MAY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH

RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS

CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUES IT RECEIVES FROM

TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY WILL

REDUCE TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER TRADING

REVENUES. HIGHER INTEREST RATES OR WEAKNESS IN THE MARKETS ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS THE FIRM MANAGES ON BEHALF OF

CLIENTS AND AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS,

INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS HELD BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. THE

REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ARE AFFECTED

BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN

PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS; AND OTHER ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUES RELATING TO ITS

TRADING WILL EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH

VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS COULD NOT MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO

DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF

U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE

VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS MANAGED BY THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD

AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUES. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN,

BELOW-MARKET OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION

AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ASSETS MAY BE AFFECTED BY BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IN A POOR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES

COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE

WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS THAT CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT SUCH BUSINESSES AND THE FIRM.

SUCH CONDITIONS INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; THE LEVEL

OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF

PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS. CERTAIN CHANGES TO THESE CONDITIONS CAN

DIMINISH DEMAND FOR BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO

PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN CONSUMERS

CREDIT QUALITY COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET

CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE

GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER

BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING

COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING

COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES,

LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A

VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NONDEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING

PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC

AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND

VARIETY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY,

REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE

AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION

ALSO MAY

REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSES OR MAY

REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO

EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL

NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

4

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES

MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

THE FIRM HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW ITS BUSINESS BY

ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS

WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL

COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT

OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; OR THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED ENTITY.

INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES

INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH

EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS,

SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASES MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS OR THAT

ANY BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND WILL

RESULT IN ALL OF THE POSITIVE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS NOT ABLE

TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ITS PAST AND ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, THERE IS THE RISK THE

FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS A LARGE NUMBER OF

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR

OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE

FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT

ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF A FIRM

EMPLOYEE CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A

RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAK DOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR

EMPLOYEES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED ABILITY OF

THE FIRM TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS,

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THE FIRM ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING

FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES OR

NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANE KATRINA, OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR

REGIONAL POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO

LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES

IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO

TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS

BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY

SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION OR

LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS ARE

SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF

THE WORLD COMMONLY KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. IN THE PAST, MANY EMERGING

MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS,

INCLUDING DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES AND CAPITAL AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE

CONTROLS, AS WELL AS LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM VARIOUS UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL

DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION,

CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN THE SECURITIES OF CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE

ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED

AS NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS (PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS) ARE USUALLY

SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS. THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THE FIRM WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ARISING FROM ITS NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE

IN THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, ITS REPUTATION COULD BE

DAMAGED, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACT WITH ITS COUNTER-PARTIES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED. THE

FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR TO APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT

COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS

PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ETHICAL ISSUES,

MONEY-LAUNDERING, PRIVACY, RECORD-KEEPING, SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES, AND THE

PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS

INHERENT IN ITS PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD

MAKE THE FIRMS CLIENTS UNWILLING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FIRM, WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND ITS

BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS TO

WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE REGULATIONS

TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS OPERATIONS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT CAN GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

CERTAIN REGULATORS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER IN REVIEWING

THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND APPROVING ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. PARTICULARLY IN RECENT

YEARS, THE FIRMS BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED REGULATION AND REGULATORY

SCRUTINY, OFTEN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FIRM RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM

EXPANDS ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS ACTIVITIES WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO AN

INCREASING RANGE OF NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LIKELY WILL IMPOSE NEW

REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT, OR THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

ARE INTERPRETED OR ENFORCED, WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY

TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY

INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT

AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. THESE OR OTHER

FUTURE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS,

FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM,

5

PART I

WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION,

OR CAUSE IT SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES ARE ITS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. IF JPMORGAN

CHASE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS MAY HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE AFFECT ON JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES

THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST

PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND ALSO MAY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR

LENDING AND INVESTING. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES

DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ITS RISKS MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MADE UP OF VARIOUS PROCESSES

AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THE FIRMS RISK EXPOSURE. TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS SUBJECT INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK,

OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK,

AMONG OTHERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK TO MANAGE

RISK, INCLUDING SUCH FRAMEWORKS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, WILL BE EFFECTIVE UNDER

ALL CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE

TO EVOLVE, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT

PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE DERIVATIVES MARKETS CONTINUE TO

GROW AND THE FIRMS PARTICIPATION IN THESE MARKETS EXPANDS, THERE IS THE RISK

THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR MANAGED OR THAT THE DOCUMENTATION OF THESE

TRADES BY THE FIRM OR ITS COUNTERPARTIES WILL NOT KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASED PACE

OF SETTLEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE PHYSICAL

SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, DO NOT

ALWAYS HOLD THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES OR LOANS RELATING TO SUCH DERIVATIVES; IF THE

FIRM IS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE SECURITIES OR LOANS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME

FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT.

IF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, WHETHER BECAUSE IT

DOES NOT KEEP PACE WITH CHANGING FIRM OR MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHERWISE, THE

FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS

BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE

PROFITABLE. A COMPROMISE TO THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY COULD THEREFORE HAVE A NEGATIVE

EFFECT ON THE FIRM. POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY INCLUDE DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND AN INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS.

THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MAINTAINING ITS LIQUIDITY, AND A

REDUCTION IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY. A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE, DEPENDING ON ITS SEVERITY, COULD POTENTIALLY

INCREASE BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS OR

COLLATERAL POSTING, AND PERMIT TERMINATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A PARTY.

FUTURE EVENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE ANTICIPATED BY JPMORGAN

CHASES MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, WHICH MAY CAUSE

UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ESTIMATES IN PREPARING

ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE LOAN LOSS

RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO FUTURE LITIGATION, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. SHOULD THE FIRMS DETERMINED VALUES FOR SUCH

ITEMS PROVE SUBSTANTIALLY INACCURATE, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.

ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS

NONE.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

THE HEADQUARTERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY AT 270 PARK

AVENUE, WHICH IS A 50-STORY BANK AND OFFICE BUILDING OWNED BY JPMORGAN

CHASE. THIS LOCATION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE.

IN TOTAL, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS OR LEASES APPROXIMATELY 10.7 MILLION SQUARE

FEET OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE SPACE AND RETAIL SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER WITH BANK ONE ON JULY 1, 2004, THE HEADQUARTERS OF BANK

ONE WAS LOCATED IN CHICAGO AT 10 SOUTH DEARBORN, WHICH CONTINUES TO BE

USED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITY. THIS LOCATION IS OWNED BY

THE FIRM AND CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. IN TOTAL,

JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS OR LEASES APPROXIMATELY 4.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF

COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE IN CHICAGO.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OWN OR LEASE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN HOUSTON AND DALLAS, TEXAS (AN AGGREGATE 5.8

MILLION SQUARE FEET); COLUMBUS, OHIO (2.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET); PHOENIX,

ARIZONA (1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET); JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY (1.2 MILLION SQUARE

FEET); AND WILMINGTON, DELAWARE (1.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET).

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, JPMORGAN CHASE LEASES APPROXIMATELY 2.3 MILLION

SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE AND OWNS A 350,000 SQUARE-FOOT OPERATIONS CENTER.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS

TYPES OF OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING 3,079 RETAIL BRANCHES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED

ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY DETERMINE CERTAIN OF ITS PREMISES AND FACILITIES ARE NO LONGER

NECESSARY FOR ITS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO

DISPOSE OF ANY SUCH EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS. SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OCCUPANCY EXPENSE,

SEE THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION ON PAGE 30.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE

INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF ITS BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

ENRON CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (ENRON). SEVERAL ACTIONS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE FIRM HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, INCLUDING ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS

BROUGHT BY ENRONS BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE

FIRM HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LEAD CLASS ACTION LITIGATION

BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PURCHASERS OF ENRON SECURITIES, CAPTIONED

NEWBY V.

ENRON CORP.

, FOR $2.2 BILLION (PRETAX). ON MAY 24, 2006, THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS APPROVED A SETTLEMENT IN THE

NEWBY

ACTION, AND ENTERED AN ORDER OF FINAL JUDGMENT AND DISMISSAL AS TO THE

JPMORGAN CHASE DEFENDANTS. CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THIS FINAL JUDGMENT TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, AND ONE SUCH

APPEAL REMAINS PENDING. THE

NEWBY

SETTLEMENT DOES NOT RESOLVE ENRON-RELATED

ACTIONS FILED SEPARATELY BY PLAINTIFFS WHO OPTED OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION OR BY

CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE ASSERTING CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY THAT ACTION, INCLUDING

SOME OF THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ENRON-RELATED ACTIONS, OTHER THAN

NEWBY,

INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AGAINST THE

FIRM BY PLAINTIFFS WHO WERE LENDERS OR CLAIM TO BE SUCCESSORS-IN-INTEREST TO

LENDERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ENRON CREDIT FACILITIES SYNDICATED BY THE FIRM; INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BY ENRON INVESTORS, CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES; AND THIRD-PARTY ACTIONS BROUGHT BY DEFENDANTS IN ENRON-RELATED CASES,

ALLEGING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND MANY OTHER

DEFENDANTS. FACT AND EXPERT DISCOVERY IN THESE ACTIONS IS COMPLETE. PLAINTIFFS IN

TWO OF THE BANK LENDER CASES HAVE MOVED FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT, AND

WERE SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED IN THAT MOTION BY PLAINTIFFS IN THE OTHER TWO CASES.

THE FIRM OPPOSED THIS MOTION, BRIEFING HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND THE PARTIES

AWAIT THE COURTS RULING.

IN ADDITION, IN MARCH 2006, TWO PLAINTIFFS FILED COMPLAINTS IN NEW YORK

SUPREME COURT AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF

IMPLIED DUTY OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING AND BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BASED

UPON THE FIRMS ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE IN CONNECTION WITH TWO INDENTURE

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND ENRON. THE FIRM REMOVED BOTH

ACTIONS TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK. THE FEDERAL COURT DISMISSED ONE OF THESE CASES AND REMANDED THE OTHER

TO NEW YORK STATE COURT WHERE IT WILL NOW PROCEED.

IN A PURPORTED, CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BY JPMORGAN CHASE STOCKHOLDERS ALLEGING THAT THE FIRM ISSUED FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES AND

OTHER PUBLIC DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ENRON IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 10(B) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER, THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DISMISSED THE LAWSUIT IN ITS

ENTIRETY WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN MARCH 2005. PLAINTIFFS FILLED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN MAY 2005. THE FIRM HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT,

AND THE MOTION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOR DECISION.

A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS

OF JPMORGAN CHASE ASSERTING THAT THE BOARD WRONGFULLY REFUSED PLAINTIFFS

DEMAND THAT IT BRING SUIT AGAINST CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY TO RECOVER LOSSES ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED BY JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS AFFILIATES AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ALLEGED ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ENRON. THE COMPLAINT ASSERTS DERIVATIVE CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY

DUTY, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, AND CORPORATE WASTE AND ASSERTS A VIOLATION OF

SECTION 14(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. ON OCTOBER 11, 2006,

DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, AND ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE

MOTION WAS HELD ON JANUARY 19, 2007. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2007, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO REPLEAD.

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRMS 401(K) PLAN ALLEGED CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND

NEGLIGENCE BY JPMORGAN CHASE, ITS DIRECTORS AND NAMED OFFICERS. IN AUGUST

2005, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

DENIED PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND ORDERED SOME OF PLAINTIFFS

CLAIMS DISMISSED. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE FIRM MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THIS ERISA LAWSUIT IN ITS ENTIRETY AND, IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN PART, AND ORDERED PLAINTIFFS TO SHOW

CAUSE AS TO WHY THE REMAINING CLAIMS SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED. ON DECEMBER

27, 2006, THE COURT DISMISSED THE CASE WITH PREJUDICE. ON DECEMBER 29,

2006, PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL, WHICH IS PENDING.

IPO ALLOCATION LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MAY 2001, JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN

OF ITS SECURITIES SUBSIDIARIES WERE NAMED, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS IN

THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK. THESE SUITS ALLEGE IMPROPRIETIES IN THE ALLOCATION OF

SECURITIES IN VARIOUS

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, INCLUDING SOME OFFERINGS FOR WHICH A JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY

SERVED AS AN UNDERWRITER. THE SUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST

LAWS ARISING FROM ALLEGED MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS IN REGISTRATION

STATEMENTS AND PROSPECTUSES FOR THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS) AND

ALLEGED MARKET MANIPULATION WITH RESPECT TO AFTERMARKET TRANSACTIONS IN THE

OFFERED SECURITIES. THE SECURITIES LAWSUITS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MISREPRESENTATION AND MARKET MANIPULATION OF THE AFTERMARKET TRADING FOR THESE OFFERINGS BY TYING ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN IPOS TO UNDISCLOSED EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS

PAID TO THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND TO REQUIRED AFTERMARKET PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS BY

CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN THE RESPECTIVE IPOS, AS WELL AS

ALLEGATIONS OF MISLEADING ANALYST REPORTS. THE ANTITRUST LAWSUITS ALLEGE AN ILLEGAL

CONSPIRACY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS, IN EXCHANGE FOR IPO ALLOCATIONS, TO PAY UNDISCLOSED AND EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS AND TO MAKE AFTERMARKET PURCHASES OF THE

IPO SECURITIES AT A PRICE HIGHER THAN THE OFFERING PRICE AS A PRECONDITION TO

RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS. THE SECURITIES CASES WERE ALL ASSIGNED TO ONE JUDGE FOR

COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND THE ANTITRUST CASES WERE ALL ASSIGNED TO

ANOTHER JUDGE. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2003, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHERS TO DISMISS THE SECURITIES COMPLAINTS. ON OCTOBER

13, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASSES IN SIX

FOCUS CASES IN THE SECURITIES LITIGATION. ON DECEMBER 5, 2006, THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT REVERSED AND VACATED THE COURTS

CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING. ON JANUARY 5, 2007, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR

REHEARING EN BANC IN THE SECOND CIRCUIT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

ON FEBRUARY 15, 2005, THE COURT IN THE SECURITIES CASES PRELIMINARILY APPROVED

A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AGAINST 298 OF THE ISSUER DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES AND A FAIRNESS HEARING ON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WAS

HELD ON APRIL 24, 2006. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED ISSUER SETTLEMENT, THE INSURERS FOR THE SETTLING ISSUER DEFENDANTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (1) AGREED TO GUARANTEE THAT THE PLAINTIFF CLASSES WILL RECOVER AT LEAST $1 BILLION FROM THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS IN THE IPO SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST CASES AND TO PAY ANY

SHORTFALL, AND (2) CONDITIONALLY ASSIGNED TO THE PLAINTIFFS ANY CLAIMS RELATED TO

ANY EXCESS COMPENSATION ALLEGEDLY PAID TO THE UNDERWRITERS BY THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR ALLOCATIONS OF STOCK IN THE OFFERINGS AT ISSUE IN THE IPO LITIGATION. AT

THE REQUEST OF THE COURT THAT THE PARTIES TO THE PROPOSED ISSUER SETTLEMENT

ADDRESS THE ANNOUNCED PRELIMINARY MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)

BETWEEN PLAINTIFFS AND JPMORGAN CHASE DESCRIBED BELOW, ON NOVEMBER 15,

7

PART I

2006, THE ISSUER DEFENDANTS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT A REVISED PROPOSED ORDER.

ON NOVEMBER 29, 2006, THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS SUBMITTED OBJECTIONS TO

THE REVISED PROPOSED ORDER. THE COURT HAS NOT YET APPROVED THE PROPOSED

ISSUER SETTLEMENT, AND THE ISSUER DEFENDANTS HAVE RAISED THE QUESTION WITH THE

COURT AS TO WHETHER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASSES CAN BE CERTIFIED AS A

RESULT OF THE SECOND CIRCUITS DECEMBER 5, 2006 DECISION.

JOSEPH P. LASALA, THE TRUSTEE DESIGNATED BY PLAINTIFFS TO ACT AS ASSIGNEE OF SUCH

ISSUER EXCESS COMPENSATION CLAIMS, FILED COMPLAINTS PURPORTING TO ALLEGE STATE

LAW CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN ISSUERS AGAINST CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN SECURITIES

(THE LASALA ACTIONS), TOGETHER WITH MOTIONS TO STAY PROCEEDINGS IN EACH CASE. ON AUGUST 30, 2005, THE COURT STAYED UNTIL RESOLUTION OF

THE PROPOSED ISSUER SETTLEMENT THE 55 LASALA ACTIONS THEN PENDING AGAINST

JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND OTHER UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS AT THAT TIME, AS WELL AS

ALL FUTURE-FILED LASALA ACTIONS PURSUANT TO THE PARTIES STIPULATION THAT THE

COURTS DECISION WOULD GOVERN STAY MOTIONS IN ALL FUTURE LASALA ACTIONS. ON

OCTOBER 12, 2005, THE COURT GRANTED THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS ONE LASALA ACTION, WHICH BY STIPULATION APPLIED TO THE PARALLEL MOTIONS

TO DISMISS IN ALL OTHER PENDING AND FUTURE-FILED LASALA ACTIONS. PLAINTIFFS THEREAFTER FILED AMENDED COMPLAINTS IN THE LEAD AND OTHER LASALA ACTIONS. ON

NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN THE LEAD LASALA ACTION AND, BY VIRTUE OF THE STIPULATION

OF THE PARTIES, THEREBY MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINTS IN ALL OTHER

PENDING AND FUTURE-FILED LASALA ACTIONS. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2006, JUDGMENT WAS

ENTERED BY THE COURT DISMISSING ALL PENDING LASALA ACTIONS. ON MARCH 14,

2006, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, ALTERATION OR AMENDMENT OF

THE FEBRUARY 28 JUDGMENT. ON APRIL 28, 2006, THE COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.

ON APRIL 19, 2006,

COUNSEL FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFFS

IN THE IPO SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST LITIGATIONS ENTERED INTO A PRELIMINARY MOU

OUTLINING THE GENERAL TERMS OF A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDING THAT

JPMORGAN SECURITIES WOULD PAY A SUM OF $425 MILLION TO RESOLVE THE CLAIMS OF

THE PLAINTIFFS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND JPMORGAN SECURITIES IN THE SECURITIES AND

ANTITRUST CASES. THE MOU SPECIFIED THAT THE CERTIFICATION OF THE CLASSES

ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINTS WAS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ANY FINAL, BINDING SETTLEMENT.

BY LETTER DATED DECEMBER 13, 2006, COUNSEL FOR JPMORGAN CHASE

INFORMED COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE IPO SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST LITIGATIONS

THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DUE TO THE SECOND CIRCUITS DECEMBER 5, 2006, CLASS

CERTIFICATION DECISION, THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASSES UPON WHICH THE PRELIMINARY MOU

WAS CONDITIONED CAN NO LONGER BE CERTIFIED AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE

MOU IS UNENFORCEABLE. AT A DECEMBER 14, 2006, CONFERENCE, THE COURT STAYED

ALL PROCEEDINGS IN THE IPO SECURITIES ACTIONS PENDING THE SECOND CIRCUITS DECISION

AS TO WHETHER TO GRANT PLAINTIFFS PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC.

WITH RESPECT TO THE IPO ANTITRUST LAWSUITS, ON NOVEMBER 3, 2003, THE COURT

GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE IPO ALLOCATION

PRACTICES IN THE IPO ALLOCATION ANTITRUST LITIGATION. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2005,

THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT REVERSED, VACATED

AND REMANDED THE DISTRICT COURTS NOVEMBER 3, 2003, DISMISSAL DECISION.

DEFENDANTS THEREAFTER FILED A MOTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC IN THE SECOND

CIRCUIT, WHICH WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 11, 2006. THEREAFTER, DEFENDANTS FILED A

PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON MARCH 8,

2006. THE CERTIORARI PETITION WAS GRANTED BY THE SUPREME COURT ON

DECEMBER 7, 2006, AND ORAL ARGUMENT WILL BE HELD IN EARLY 2007.

A WHOLLY SEPARATE ANTITRUST

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF PURPORTED CLASSES

OF IPO ISSUERS AND INVESTORS ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN SECURITIES,

CONSPIRED TO FIX THEIR UNDERWRITING FEES IN IPOS IS IN DISCOVERY. ON

APRIL 18, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

DENIED CLASS CERTIFICATION AS TO THE ISSUER PLAINTIFFS. THE DENIAL OF CLASS CERTIFICATION HAS BEEN APPEALED TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT. FURTHER MATTERS ARE CURRENTLY STAYED PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE SECOND

CIRCUIT APPEAL.

NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES LITIGATION

. JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK, N.A., JPMORGAN PARTNERS, BEACON GROUP, LLC AND THREE FORMER FIRM

EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN ACTIONS FILED

IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

OHIO (THE MDL LITIGATION). IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACTIONS, BANK ONE, BANK

ONE, N.A., AND BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. ALSO ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND BANK ONE, N.A. WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION

BROUGHT BY THE UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TRUST (UAT), A TRUST CREATED FOR THE

BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS OF NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES, INC.

(NCFE) AS A RESULT OF NCFES PLAN OF LIQUIDATION IN BANKRUPTCY. THESE

ACTIONS AROSE OUT OF THE NOVEMBER 2002 BANKRUPTCY OF NCFE. PRIOR TO BANKRUPTCY,

NCFE PROVIDED FINANCING TO VARIOUS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHOLLY OWNED SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES, INCLUDING NPF VI AND NPF XII, WHICH PURCHASED DISCOUNTED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE PAID UNDER THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE

PROGRAMS. NPF VI AND NPF XII FINANCED THE PURCHASES OF SUCH RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF NOTES (NOTES) TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS

AND PLEDGED THE RECEIVABLES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REPAYMENT OF THE

NOTES. IN THE MDL LITIGATION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE AS

INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF VI, WHICH ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN NOTES.

BANK ONE, N.A. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF XII, WHICH

ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION IN NOTES. THE THREE FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES ARE

SUED IN THEIR ROLES AS FORMER MEMBERS OF NCFES BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE

DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES). JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND BEACON

GROUP, LLC, ARE CLAIMED TO BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE FOR THE ALLEGED ACTIONS OF THE

DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES. BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE AS CO-MANAGER FOR THREE NOTE OFFERINGS MADE BY NPF XII. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE

THE FOUNDERS AND KEY EXECUTIVES OF NCFE, ITS AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, AND

RATING AGENCIES AND PLACEMENT AGENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF

THE NOTES. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO PURCHASED MORE THAN $2.7 BILLION IN ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT OF ASSET-BACKED NOTES

ISSUED BY NCFE. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE TRUSTEES VIOLATED FIDUCIARY AND CONTRACTUAL DUTIES, IMPROPERLY PERMITTED NCFE AND ITS AFFILIATES TO VIOLATE THE

APPLICABLE INDENTURES AND VIOLATED SECURITIES LAWS BY (AMONG OTHER THINGS) FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE NCFE ARRANGEMENTS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER

ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES CONTROLLED THE BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE NCFE ENTITIES; WERE FULLY AWARE, OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT KNOWING, OF NCFES

ALLEGED MANIPULATION OF ITS BOOKS; AND ARE LIABLE FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR

PURPORTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE ALLEGED FRAUD TO THE PLAINTIFFS. PLAINTIFFS ALSO ALLEGE

THAT BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. IS LIABLE FOR COOPERATING IN THE SALE OF

SECURITIES BASED UPON FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS. MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINTS WERE FILED ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM AND ITS AFFILIATES. IN OCTOBER 2006,

THE MDL COURT ISSUED RULINGS ON SOME OF THE MOTIONS TO DISMISS, GRANTING THE

MOTIONS IN PART AND DENYING THE MOTIONS IN PART. ADDITIONAL MOTIONS ARE STILL

PENDING, AND LIMITED DISCOVERY IS UNDERWAY. THE FIRM HAS REACHED SETTLEMENTS

WITH SEVERAL OF THE PLAINTIFFS: IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITIES,

THE BANK ONE ENTITIES, AND THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF

$375 MILLION WITH THE HOLDERS OF $1.6 BILLION FACE VALUE OF NOTES (THE ARIZONA

NOTEHOLDERS) AND REACHED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH THE UAT FOR $50 MILLION; AND IN JUNE 2006, THE JPMORGAN ENTITIES, THE BANK ONE ENTITIES, AND THE

DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION WITH

HOLDERS OF ABOUT $89 MILLION FACE VALUE OF NOTES (THE NEW YORK PENSION FUND

8

NOTEHOLDERS.) IN ADDITION TO THE LAWSUITS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE SEC HAS SERVED

SUBPOENAS ON JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND BANK ONE, N.A. AND

HAS INTERVIEWED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. ON APRIL 25, 2005, THE

STAFF OF THE MIDWEST REGIONAL OFFICE OF THE SEC WROTE TO ADVISE BANK

ONE, N.A. THAT

IT IS CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE

ACTION AGAINST BANK ONE, N.A. AND A FORMER EMPLOYEE ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE

SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ROLE OF BANC ONE, N.A. AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR THE

NPF XII NOTE PROGRAM. ON JULY 8, 2005, THE STAFF OF THE MIDWEST REGIONAL

OFFICE OF THE SEC WROTE TO ADVISE THAT IT IS

CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION

AGAINST TWO INDIVIDUALS, BOTH FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRMS AFFILIATES, ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ROLE AS FORMER

MEMBERS OF NCFES BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON JULY 13, 2005, THE STAFF FURTHER

ADVISED THAT IT IS CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE SEC ALSO BRING A

CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE FIRM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES

OF THE TWO INDIVIDUALS AS ALLEGED AGENTS OF THE FIRM. LASTLY, THE UNITED STATES

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ALSO INVESTIGATING THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE COLLAPSE

OF NCFE, AND THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THAT INVESTIGATION.

IN RE JPMORGAN CHASE CASH BALANCE LITIGATION.

IN A PUTATIVE CONSOLIDATED CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT, FILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK,

NAMING THE JPMORGAN CHASE RETIREMENT PLAN (TOGETHER WITH THE PREDECESSOR

PLANS OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. PREDECESSOR COMPANIES, THE PLANS) AND

THE JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES AS DEFENDANTS, CURRENT AND FORMER PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLANS ALLEGE VARIOUS CLAIMS UNDER THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS ARE

BASED UPON ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ERISA ARISING FROM THE CONVERSION TO AND USE

OF A CASH BALANCE FORMULA UNDER THE PLANS TO CALCULATE PARTICIPANTS PENSION

BENEFITS. SPECIFICALLY, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT: (1) THE CONVERSION TO AND USE OF A

CASH BALANCE FORMULA UNDER THE PLANS VIOLATED ERISAS PROSCRIPTION AGAINST AGE

DISCRIMINATION (THE AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM); (2) THE CONVERSION TO A CASH

BALANCE FORMULA VIOLATED ERISAS PROSCRIPTIONS AGAINST THE BACKLOADING OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CREATED AN IMPERMISSIBLE FORFEITURE OF ACCRUED BENEFITS (THE

BACKLOADING AND FORFEITURE CLAIMS); AND (3) DEFENDANTS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY

COMMUNICATE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS THE CONVERSION TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA

AND IN GENERAL THE NATURE OF THE PLAN (THE NOTICE CLAIMS). IN OCTOBER 2006,

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DENIED

THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE AGE DISCRIMINATION AND NOTICE CLAIMS, BUT

GRANTED THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE BACKLOADING AND FORFEITURE CLAIMS.

PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION IS FULLY BRIEFED AND REMAINS PENDING

WITH THE COURT. FACT DISCOVERY IS ONGOING, BUT ONLY AS TO THE NOTICE CLAIMS.

DISCOVERY AS TO THE AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY STAYED,

PENDING RESOLUTION OF A SIMILAR CASE THAT IS NOW BEFORE THE UNITED STATES COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

AMERICAN EXPRESS LITIGATION.

IN 1998, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

(DOJ) COMMENCED AN ACTION AGAINST VISA U.S.A., INC., VISA INTERNATIONAL,

INC. AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED ALLEGING THAT VISA

BY-LAW

2.10(E) AND MASTERCARDS COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS POLICY (THE

EXCLUSIONARY RULES), WHICH

PRECLUDED ANY MEMBER OF EITHER OF THE FOREGOING ASSOCIATIONS FROM ISSUING

PAYMENT CARDS OVER THE DISCOVER OR AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (OR ANY OTHER

COMPETITIVE NETWORK), VIOLATED THE ANTITRUST LAWS AND WERE ANTICOMPETITIVE.

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HELD THAT

THE EXCLUSIONARY RULES HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON COMPETITION AND COULD NOT BE ENFORCED BY

THE ASSOCIATIONS. THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

AFFIRMED, AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED REVIEW ON OCTOBER 4,

2004, RESULTING IN THE REPEAL OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULES.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2004, AMERICAN EXPRESS FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST VISA,

MASTERCARD, CHASE BANK USA, N.A. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER

CREDIT CARD ISSUING BANKS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ALLEGING THAT

IT SUFFERED DAMAGES FROM THE EXCLUSIONARY RULES. AMERICAN EXPRESS CLAIMS

THAT, IN ADDITION TO VISA AND MASTERCARD, MEMBER BANKS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN

ADOPTING AND CARRYING OUT THE EXCLUSIONARY RULES AND THAT THE EXCLUSIONARY

RULES WERE RESTRICTIONS BY AND FOR THE MEMBER BANKS; AND THAT THE MEMBER

BANKS AGREED NOT TO COMPETE BY MEANS OF OFFERING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

ON AUGUST 30, 2005, THE COURT DENIED THE DEFENDANTS RESPECTIVE MOTIONS TO

DISMISS, FINDING THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT SATISFIED PLEADING RULES

AND WERE THEREFORE SUFFICIENT TO WITHSTAND THE MOTIONS. THE COURT ALSO DECIDED THAT, AT THIS TIME, THE BANK DEFENDANTS, WHICH WERE NOT PARTIES TO THE DOJ

ACTION, ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY OF THE PRIOR FINDINGS AND DECISIONS IN THAT CASE.

DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION.

ON JUNE 22, 2005, A GROUP OF MERCHANTS FILED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

CONNECTICUT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT VISA, MASTERCARD, CHASE BANK

USA, N.A. AND JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER BANKS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, CONSPIRED TO SET THE PRICE OF INTERCHANGE IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT. THE COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES

TYING/BUNDLING AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING. SINCE THE FILING OF THE CONNECTICUT COMPLAINT, OTHER COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED IN DIFFERENT UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURTS CHALLENGING THE SETTING OF INTERCHANGE, AS WELL THE ASSOCIATIONS RESPECTIVE RULES. ALL CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON

APRIL 24, 2006. DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS THAT PREDATE JANUARY 1, 2004. THE MOTION HAS NOT YET BEEN DECIDED.

PLAINTIFFS SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT CHALLENGING

MASTERCARDS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2006, ALLEGING THAT THE OFFERING VIOLATES

THE SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT AND THAT THE OFFERING WAS A FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE. DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS BOTH OF THOSE CLAIMS. THE

MOTION HAS NOT YET BEEN DECIDED. DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR

OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A

NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS, INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS

MAY BE INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE

CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY

STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL

OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL

LOSS, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON

ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS,

PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL, ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM.

HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ACTIONS

AND INVESTIGATIONS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE

MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM;

AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN

CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING UPON, AMONG

OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF

JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED

OUT UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE

13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED UPON THAT

EVALUA-

TION, THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE. SEE EXHIBITS

31.1 AND 31.2 FOR THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR

DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

DEFICIENCIES  OR EVEN MATERIAL WEAKNESSES  IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE.

SEE PAGE 88 FOR MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, AND PAGE 89 FOR THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL.

THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS

DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS

REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.

APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION BY THE END OF 2007. THE

FIRM REALIZED APPROXIMATELY $675 MILLION OF

INCREMENTAL MERGER SAVINGS IN 2006, BRINGING ESTIMATED

CUMULATIVE SAVINGS FOR 2006 TO $2.5 BILLION, AND

THE ANNUALIZED RUN-RATE OF SAVINGS ENTERING 2007 IS

APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

THESE SAVINGS, THE FIRM EXPENSED MERGER COSTS OF

$305 MILLION DURING THE YEAR (INCLUDING A MODEST

AMOUNT OF COSTS RELATED TO THE BANK

OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION), BRINGING THE TOTAL

CUMULATIVE AMOUNT EXPENSED SINCE THE MERGER

ANNOUNCEMENT TO APPROXIMATELY $3.4 BILLION (INCLUDING CAPITALIZED

COSTS). MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY ESTIMATES REMAINING

MERGER COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION, WHICH

ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED DURING 2007 AND WILL

INCLUDE A MODEST AMOUNT OF EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF THE BANK OF NEW YORKS CONSUMER,

BUSINESS BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING

BUSINESSES.

THE FIRM ALSO CONTINUED ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ITS

PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES DURING 2006. ACTIONS

INCLUDED: EXCHANGING SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST

BUSINESSES FOR THE CONSUMER, BUSINESS BANKING AND

MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING BUSINESSES OF THE BANK OF NEW

YORK; DIVESTING THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS; PURCHASING COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES TO

DEVELOP FURTHER THE EDUCATION FINANCE BUSINESS;

ACQUIRING KOHLS PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO; ACQUIRING THE MIDDLE AND BACK OFFICE

OPERATIONS OF PALOMA PARTNERS TO EXPAND THE FIRMS

HEDGE FUND ADMINISTRATION CAPABILITIES; AND

ANNOUNCING A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH FIDELITY

BROKERAGE TO PROVIDE NEW ISSUE EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME PRODUCTS.

IN 2006, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUED TO EXPAND,

WHICH SUPPORTED CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH IN THE

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES. GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC

PRODUCT INCREASED BY AN ESTIMATED 5%, WITH THE

EUROPEAN ECONOMY GAINING MOMENTUM, JAPAN MAKING

STEADY PROGRESS AND EMERGING ASIAN ECONOMIES

EXPANDING APPROXIMATELY 8%. THE U.S. ECONOMY

REBOUNDED EARLY IN THE YEAR FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR

HURRICANE DISRUPTIONS, BUT WEAKENED IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR AS HOME CONSTRUCTION DECLINED,

AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING WEAKENED AND THE BENEFIT

OF RECONSTRUCTION FROM HURRICANE DISRUPTIONS

DISSIPATED. THE U.S. EXPERIENCED RISING INTEREST

RATES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, AS THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INCREASED THE FEDERAL FUNDS

RATE FROM 4.25% TO 5.25%. WITH AN ANTICIPATED

SLOWING OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, LOWER INFLATION AND

STABILIZING ENERGY PRICES, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE

WAS HELD STEADY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE YIELD CURVE SUBSEQUENTLY INVERTED AS RECEDING

INFLATION EXPECTATIONS PUSHED LONG-TERM INTEREST

RATES BELOW THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. EQUITY MARKETS,

BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, REFLECTED POSITIVE

PERFORMANCE, WITH THE S&P 500 UP 13% ON AVERAGE AND

INTERNATIONAL INDICES INCREASING 16% ON AVERAGE

DURING 2006. GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY WAS

STRONG DURING 2006, WITH DEBT AND EQUITY

UNDERWRITING AND MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

SURPASSING 2005 LEVELS. DEMAND FOR WHOLESALE LOANS

IN THE U.S. WAS STRONG WITH GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY

14%, WHILE U.S. CONSUMER LOANS GREW AN ESTIMATED 4%

DURING 2006. U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING GREW AT A SOLID

PACE, SUPPORTED BY STRONG EQUITY MARKETS, LOW

UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCOME GROWTH, AND LOWER ENERGY

PRICES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THIS

STRENGTH CAME DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REAL

ESTATE APPRECIATION.

THE 2006 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WAS A CONTRIBUTING

FACTOR TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND EACH OF

ITS BUSINESSES. THE OVERALL ECONOMIC EXPANSION,

STRONG LEVEL OF CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY AND

POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS HELPED TO

DRIVE NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND ORGANIC GROWTH WITHIN

EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES WHILE ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE STABLE CREDIT QUALITY WITHIN

THE LOAN PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, THE INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT AFFECTED NEGATIVELY WHOLESALE LOAN

SPREAD AND CONSUMER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS.

SPREADS RELATED TO WHOLESALE LIABILITIES WIDENED

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, BUT THIS BENEFIT

DECLINED OVER THE COURSE OF 2006.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE

PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR, AND DISCUSSES RESULTS ON A MANAGED

BASIS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. FOR MORE INFORMATION

ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND

RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 3233 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

INVESTMENT BANK

NET INCOME WAS FLAT COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR, AS RECORD REVENUE WAS OFFSET BY

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND A PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. REVENUE BENEFITED FROM INVESTMENTS IN KEY

BUSINESS INITIATIVES, INCREASED MARKET SHARE AND

HIGHER GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY. RECORD

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE DRIVEN BY RECORD DEBT

AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES AND STRONG ADVISORY

FEES. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE SET A NEW RECORD

WITH STRENGTH IN CREDIT MARKETS, EMERGING MARKETS

AND CURRENCIES. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS ALSO AT

A RECORD LEVEL, REFLECTING STRENGTH IN CASH

EQUITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES. THE CURRENT-YEAR

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTS PORTFOLIO

ACTIVITY; CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STABLE. THE

INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF A HIGHER RATIO OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO

REVENUE AND THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

NET INCOME WAS DOWN FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR AS LOWER RESULTS IN MORTGAGE BANKING

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN

REGIONAL BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE. REVENUE DECLINED

DUE TO LOWER REVENUE IN MORTGAGE BANKING, NARROWER

LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS IN REGIONAL BANKING AND

THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS ON JULY 1, 2006.

DEPOSIT AND LOAN SPREADS REFLECTED THE CURRENT

INTEREST RATE AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. THESE

FACTORS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY INCREASES IN

AVERAGE DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES AND HIGHER

DEPOSIT-RELATED AND BRANCH PRODUCTION FEES IN

REGIONAL BANKING, WHICH BENEFITED FROM THE

CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN THE RETAIL BANKING

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF

THE U.S. ECONOMY. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

DECLINED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF

A SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA IN

2005, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO

LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK. EXPENSE

INCREASED, REFLECTING THE PURCHASE OF COLLEGIATE

FUNDING SERVICES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 AND

ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL BANKING

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, WITH THE NET ADDITION DURING

THE YEAR OF 438 BRANCH OFFICES (INCLUDING 339 FROM

THE BANK OF NEW YORK), 1,194 ATMS AND OVER 500

PERSONAL BANKERS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE

INCREASES WERE THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS

AND MERGER-RELATED AND OTHER OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES.

CARD SERVICES

NET INCOME WAS A RECORD, INCREASING

SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A LOWER PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES. NET REVENUE (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH) DECLINED

SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME

WAS FLAT AS THE BENEFIT OF AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE

MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY DUE TO PORTFOLIO

ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS MARKETING INITIATIVES, WAS

OFFSET BY THE CHALLENGING INTEREST RATE AND

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE

DECLINED AS INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME RELATED TO

HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME FROM INCREASED CONSUMER

SPENDING WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY HIGHER

VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, INCLUDING

KOHLS, AND INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE. THE MANAGED

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES BENEFITED FROM

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED CREDIT

LOSSES FOLLOWING THE NEW BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION

THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2005. UNDERLYING

CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STRONG. EXPENSE (EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH)

INCREASED DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING AND

ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER SAVINGS.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

NET INCOME WAS A RECORD IN 2006.

RECORD REVENUE BENEFITED FROM HIGHER LIABILITY

BALANCES, HIGHER LOAN VOLUMES AND INCREASED

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE, ALL OF WHICH BENEFITED

FROM INCREASED SALES EFFORTS AND U.S. ECONOMIC

GROWTH. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS WERE

LOAN SPREAD COMPRESSION AND A SHIFT TO

NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS. THE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR REFLECTING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY AND THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN

LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK OF

NEW YORK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A RELEASE OF THE

UNUSED PORTION OF THE SPECIAL RESERVE ESTABLISHED

IN 2005 FOR HURRICANE KATRINA. CREDIT QUALITY

REMAINED STABLE. EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R AND INCREASED EXPENSE RELATED TO HIGHER

CLIENT USAGE OF TREASURY SERVICES PRODUCTS.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES

NET INCOME WAS A

RECORD AND INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PRIOR

YEAR. REVENUE WAS AT A RECORD LEVEL DRIVEN BY

HIGHER AVERAGE LIABILITY BALANCES, BUSINESS GROWTH,

INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY CLIENTS AND HIGHER

ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY, ALL OF WHICH BENEFITED FROM

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITY. THIS GROWTH WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A

SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS.

EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER COMPENSATION

RELATED TO BUSINESS GROWTH, INVESTMENTS IN NEW

PRODUCTS AND THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R. THE EXPENSE

INCREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE ABSENCE OF A

PRIOR-YEAR CHARGE TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME WAS A RECORD IN 2006.

RECORD REVENUE BENEFITED FROM INCREASED ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT DRIVEN BY NET ASSET INFLOWS AND

STRENGTH IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS, AND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT REFLECTING NET LOAN

RECOVERIES. EXPENSE INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO

HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCREMENTAL

EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, AND

INCREASED MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO

HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC (HIGHBRIDGE),

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO.

CORPORATE

SEGMENT REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

RESULTS (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER, BELOW) DRIVEN BY

LOWER EXPENSE, IMPROVED REVENUE AND THE BENEFIT OF

TAX AUDIT RESOLUTIONS. REVENUE BENEFITED FROM LOWER

SECURITIES LOSSES, IMPROVED NET INTEREST SPREAD AND

A HIGHER LEVEL OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF THE GAIN ON THE

SALE OF BROWNCO AND LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS.

EXPENSE BENEFITED FROM THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR

LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES, HIGHER INSURANCE RECOVERIES

RELATING TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LITIGATION, LOWER

MERGER-RELATED COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2006, THE FIRM COMPLETED THE EXCHANGE

OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

TRUSTEE, PAYING AGENT, LOAN AGENCY AND DOCUMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, FOR THE CONSUMER, BUSINESS

BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING BUSINESSES OF THE

BANK OF NEW YORK. THE CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES,

WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN TSS, WERE

REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE RELATED

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY IS

REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT FOR ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED. DURING 2006, THESE BUSINESSES PRODUCED

$795 MILLION OF NET INCOME COMPARED WITH NET INCOME

OF $229 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INCOME FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN

2006 DUE TO A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $622

MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF THESE BUSINESSES. A

MODEST AMOUNT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITION SIDE OF THIS TRANSACTION ARE INCLUDED

IN MERGER COSTS.

26

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT COSTS FOR THE FIRM WERE $5.5 BILLION

COMPARED WITH $7.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

$1.8 BILLION DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER

BANKRUPTCY-RELATED LOSSES IN CARD SERVICES AND THE

RELEASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR OF A PORTION OF THE

$400 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE

KATRINA THAT WAS TAKEN IN 2005. THE DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE

PROVISION. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS $321 MILLION

COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $811 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO

PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

NONPERFORMING LOANS. CREDIT QUALITY IN THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WAS STABLE. THE BENEFIT IN 2005

WAS DUE TO IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY, REFLECTED

BY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURES

AND NONPERFORMING LOANS. CONSUMER PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS $5.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $8.1

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE REDUCTION PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

BANKRUPTCY-RELATED CREDIT LOSSES AND A SPECIAL

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2005 RELATED TO

HURRICANE KATRINA.

THE FIRM

HAD, AT YEAR END, TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY OF $115.8 BILLION, AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL

RATIO OF 8.7%. THE FIRM PURCHASED $3.9 BILLION, OR

91 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE YEAR.

2007 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

BASED UPON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH

IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2007 SHOULD BE VIEWED

AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY AND THE GEOPOLITICAL

ENVIRONMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE LINKED INTEGRALLY.

WHILE THE FIRM CONSIDERS OUTCOMES FOR, AND HAS

CONTINGENCY PLANS TO RESPOND TO, STRESS

ENVIRONMENTS, THE BASIC OUTLOOK FOR 2007 IS

PREDICATED ON THE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS IMPLIED

IN THE FORWARD RATE CURVE FOR U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES, THE CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS AND CONTINUED

EXPANSION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

THE INVESTMENT BANK ENTERS 2007 WITH A STRONG

INVESTMENT BANKING FEE PIPELINE AND REMAINS

FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND

CAPABILITIES. ASSET MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES GROWTH

DRIVEN BY CONTINUED NET ASSET INFLOWS. COMMERCIAL

BANKING AND TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES EXPECT

GROWTH DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND

PRODUCT SALES WITH SOME COMPETITIVE AND RATE

PRESSURES. HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES WILL BE AFFECTED BY OVERALL

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY FINANCIAL MARKET

MOVEMENTS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES ANTICIPATES BENEFITING

FROM THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE BRANCH NETWORK

AND SALES FORCE, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF THE BANK

OF NEW YORKS 339 BRANCHES, AND IMPROVED SALES

PRODUCTIVITY AND CROSS-SELLING IN THE BRANCHES.

LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE

CONTINUED COMPRESSION DUE TO THE INTEREST RATE AND

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS.

CARD SERVICES ANTICIPATES GROWTH IN MANAGED

RECEIVABLES AND SALES VOLUME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM MARKETING INITIATIVES

AND NEW PARTNERSHIPS. EXPENDITURES ON MARKETING

ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN THE 2006 LEVEL.

IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT, THE REVENUE OUTLOOK FOR

THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO

THE STRENGTH OF THE EQUITY MARKETS AND THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO

INVESTMENTS. IF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS PERSIST,

THE FIRM ANTICIPATES CONTINUED REALIZATION OF

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN 2007, BUT RESULTS CAN BE

VOLATILE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THE NET LOSS IN TREASURY AND OTHER

CORPORATE, ON A COMBINED BASIS, WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $50 TO $100 MILLION PER QUARTER IN

2007, REFLECTING MERGER SAVINGS AND OTHER EXPENSE

EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, SUCH AS LESS EXCESS REAL

ESTATE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2007 IS

ANTICIPATED TO BE HIGHER THAN IN 2006, PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY A TREND TOWARD A MORE NORMAL LEVEL OF

PROVISIONING FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN BOTH THE

WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES. THE CONSUMER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES SHOULD REFLECT A

HIGHER LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS AS BANKRUPTCY

FILINGS CONTINUE TO INCREASE FROM THE

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN NORMAL LEVELS EXPERIENCED

IN 2006 RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LAW IN

2005.

FIRMWIDE EXPENSES ARE ANTICIPATED TO REFLECT

INVESTMENTS IN EACH BUSINESS, CONTINUED MERGER

SAVINGS AND OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. ANNUAL

MERGER SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH APPROXIMATELY

$3.0 BILLION BY THE END OF 2007, UPON THE

COMPLETION OF THE LAST SIGNIFICANT CONVERSION

ACTIVITY, THE WHOLESALE DEPOSIT CONVERSION

SCHEDULED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. OFFSETTING

MERGER SAVINGS WILL BE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

DISTRIBUTION ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCT

OFFERINGS, AND EXPENSES RELATED TO RECENT

ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION. MERGER COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $400

MILLION ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED DURING 2007

(INCLUDING A MODEST AMOUNT RELATED TO THE BANK OF

NEW YORK TRANSACTION). THESE ADDITIONS ARE EXPECTED

TO BRING TOTAL CUMULATIVE MERGER COSTS TO $3.8

BILLION BY THE END OF 2007.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2006 WAS $61.4 BILLION, UP BY

$7.7 BILLION, OR 14%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS,

PRIMARILY FROM STRONG TRADING REVENUE RESULTS,

RECORD ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND

COMMISSIONS REVENUE, AND RECORD INVESTMENT BANKING

FEES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS HIGHER

NET INTEREST INCOME AND LOWER SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

LOSSES. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

A DECLINE IN OTHER INCOME PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE

GAIN RECOGNIZED IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO, AND

LOWER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WAS DRIVEN

BY RECORD DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS

STRONG ADVISORY FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE RECORDED

PRIMARILY IN THE IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 3637 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE CONSISTS OF REALIZED

AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM TRADING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

INVENTORIES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY IN THE IB, AND

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS AND LOSSES, PRIMARILY IN THE

PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS OF CORPORATE. TRADING

REVENUE INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2005 DUE TO RECORD

PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS. FOR

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE, SEE THE IB AND CORPORATE SEGMENT RESULTS

ON PAGES 3637 AND 5354, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES ROSE SLIGHTLY IN

COMPARISON WITH 2005 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER FEE

INCOME ON DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND, IN PART, FROM

THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN LENDING & DEPOSIT

RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN RFS, SEE THE

RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 3842 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION

AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY

GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN AM, WHICH

EXCEEDED $1 TRILLION AT THE END OF 2006, HIGHER

EQUITY-RELATED COMMISSIONS IN IB AND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. THE GROWTH IN

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REFLECTED NET ASSET INFLOWS

IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL SEGMENTS. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE HIGHER ASSETS

UNDER CUSTODY IN TSS DRIVEN BY MARKET VALUE

APPRECIATION AND NEW BUSINESS; AND GROWTH IN

DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS, SECURITIES LENDING AND GLOBAL

CLEARING, ALL OF WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION

OF INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY EXISTING CLIENTS AND

NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, COMMISSIONS IN THE IB

ROSE AS A RESULT OF STRENGTH ACROSS REGIONS, PARTLY

OFFSET BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND

BROWNCO. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES

AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR AM

ON PAGES 5052, TSS ON PAGES 4849 AND RFS ON

PAGES 3842, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FAVORABLE VARIANCE IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES)

WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SECURITIES LOSSES IN

TREASURY IN 2006 FROM PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING

ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES), WHICH ARE

MOSTLY RECORDED IN THE FIRMS TREASURY BUSINESS,

SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

5354 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME DECLINED IN

COMPARISON WITH 2005

REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN NET MORTGAGE SERVICING

REVENUE AND HIGHER LOSSES ON MORTGAGE LOANS

TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE. THESE DECLINES WERE

OFFSET PARTLY BY GROWTH IN PRODUCTION REVENUE AS A

RESULT OF HIGHER VOLUME OF LOANS SALES AND WIDER

GAIN ON SALE MARGINS. MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED

INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NII AND AFS SECURITIES

GAINS RELATED TO MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME,

WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS MORTGAGE

BANKING BUSINESS, SEE THE MORTGAGE BANKING

DISCUSSION ON PAGE 41 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME INCREASED FROM 2005, PRIMARILY

FROM HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME THAT FAVORABLY

IMPACTED INTERCHANGE INCOME AND SERVICING FEES

EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES, WHICH BENEFITED FROM LOWER CREDIT

LOSSES INCURRED ON SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS.

THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY INCREASES

IN VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, EXPENSES

RELATED TO REWARD PROGRAMS, AND INTEREST PAID TO

INVESTORS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS. CREDIT CARD

INCOME ALSO WAS IMPACTED NEGATIVELY BY THE

DECONSOLIDA-TION OF PAYMENTECH IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO A $1.3 BILLION PRETAX GAIN

RECOGNIZED IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO AND LOWER

GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE TWO ITEMS WERE HIGHER AUTOMOBILE OPERATING

LEASE REVENUE; AN INCREASE IN EQUITY INVESTMENT

INCOME, IN PARTICULAR, FROM CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS, LLC; AND A PRETAX GAIN OF $103 MILLION

ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES IN ITS INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE DUE LARGELY TO IMPROVEMENT

IN TREASURYS NET INTEREST SPREAD AND INCREASES IN

WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES, WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER LOANS, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND

CONSUMER DEPOSITS. INCREASES IN CONSUMER AND

WHOLESALE LOANS AND DEPOSITS INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF

THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. THESE INCREASES

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON BOTH

TRADING-RELATED ASSETS AND LOANS, A SHIFT TO

NARROWER-SPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS, RFSS SALE OF THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS AND THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO IN

AM. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING

ASSETS FOR 2006 WERE $995.5 BILLION, UP 11% FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN

INCREASE IN LOANS AND OTHER LIQUID EARNING ASSETS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INTERESTS IN

PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF THE

RESTRUCTURING AND DECONSOLIDATION DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2006 OF CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER CON-

28

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

DUITS THAT THE FIRM ADMINISTERED. THE NET YIELD

ON INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, ON A FULLY

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.16%, A DECREASE OF

FOUR BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, SEE THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION ON PAGES 3435 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2005 WAS $53.7 BILLION, UP

27% FROM 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, WHICH

AFFECTED EVERY REVENUE CATEGORY. THE INCREASE FROM

2004 ALSO WAS AFFECTED BY A $1.3 BILLION GAIN ON

THE SALE OF BROWNCO; HIGHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE; AND HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS, WHICH BENEFITED

FROM SEVERAL NEW INVESTMENTS AND GROWTH IN ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY. THESE

INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

(AFS) SECURITIES LOSSES AS A RESULT OF

REPOSITIONING OF THE FIRMS TREASURY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW HIGHLIGHT

FACTORS OTHER THAN THE MERGER THAT AFFECTED THE

2005 VERSUS 2004 COMPARISON.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WAS DRIVEN

BY STRONG GROWTH

IN ADVISORY FEES RESULTING IN PART FROM THE

CAZENOVE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE

PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 3637 AND NOTE 2 ON PAGE 97 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

REVENUE FROM PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS INCREASED

COMPARED WITH 2004, DRIVEN BY STRONGER, ALTHOUGH

VOLATILE, TRADING RESULTS ACROSS COMMODITIES,

EMERGING MARKETS, RATE MARKETS AND CURRENCIES.

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS WERE HIGHER DUE TO A

CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE CAPITAL MARKETS

CONDITIONS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE THE IB AND CORPORATE

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 3637 AND 5354, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE HIGHER LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES WERE

DRIVEN BY THE MERGER; ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE

MERGER, THE DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES WOULD HAVE BEEN

LOWER DUE TO RISING INTEREST RATES. IN A HIGHER

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE VALUE OF DEPOSIT

BALANCES TO A CUSTOMER IS GREATER, RESULTING IN A

REDUCTION OF DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF LIABILITY BALANCES (INCLUDING

DEPOSITS) SEE THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON

PAGES 4647 AND 4849, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION

AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL

FEES FROM SEVERAL NEW INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE

ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE,

THE CAZENOVE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP AND THE

ACQUISITION OF VASTERA. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

HIGHER LEVEL OF REVENUE WAS AN INCREASE IN ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING NET ASSET INFLOWS IN

EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET

APPRECIATION. IN ADDITION, ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY

WERE UP DUE TO MARKET VALUE APPRECIATION AND NEW

BUSINESS. COMMISSIONS ROSE AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER

VOLUME OF BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE

SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON PAGES 3637, AM ON

PAGES 5052 AND TSS ON PAGES 4849 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE DECLINE IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) REFLECTED

$1.3 BILLION OF SECURITIES LOSSES, AS COMPARED WITH

$338 MILLION OF GAINS IN 2004. THE LOSSES WERE DUE

TO REPOSITIONING OF THE FIRMS TREASURY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO, TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS

(LOSSES), WHICH ARE RECORDED PRIMARILY IN THE

FIRMS TREASURY BUSINESS, SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 5354 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED DUE TO

IMPROVED MSR RISK-MANAGEMENT RESULTS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME,

WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS MORTGAGE

BANKING BUSINESS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSION FOR

RFS ON PAGES 3842 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

INTERCHANGE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN

CHARGE VOLUME. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY HIGHER

VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS AND REWARDS

EXPENSE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD

INCOME, SEE CS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4345 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED A

$1.3 BILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO;

HIGHER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS AND LOAN SALES; AND

HIGHER AUTOMOBILE OPERATING LEASE INCOME.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

AVERAGE VOLUME OF, AND WIDER SPREADS ON, LIABILITY

BALANCES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS

HIGHER AVERAGE VOLUME OF WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

LOANS, IN PARTICULAR, REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD LOANS,

WHICH PARTLY REFLECTED A PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO

ACQUISITION BY CS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON CONSUMER AND

WHOLESALE LOANS AND ON TRADING-RELATED ASSETS, AS

WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE REPOSITIONING OF THE

TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND THE REVERSAL OF

REVENUE RELATED TO INCREASED BANKRUPTCIES IN CS.

THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS IN

2005 WERE $899.1 BILLION, UP 23% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A

FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.20%, A

DECREASE OF SEVEN BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2006 DECLINED

$213 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A $1.3

BILLION DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.1 BILLION

INCREASE IN WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

THE DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION WAS DRIVEN

BY CS, REFLECTING LOWER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED LOSSES,

PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CONTRACTUAL NET

CHARGE-OFFS. THE 2005 CONSUMER PROVISION ALSO

REFLECTED $350 MILLION OF A SPECIAL PROVISION

RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, A PORTION OF WHICH

WAS RELEASED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE INCREASE IN

THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO

PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

NONPERFORMING LOANS. THE BENEFIT IN 2005 WAS DUE TO

STRONG CREDIT QUALITY, REFLECTED IN SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTIONS IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE AND NONPERFORMING

LOANS. CREDIT QUALITY IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO

WAS STABLE. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE

LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 6476 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $3.5 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $939 MILLION, OR 37%, FROM 2004,

REFLECTING THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE

WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT

OF $811 MILLION FOR THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A

BENEFIT OF $716 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CREDIT QUALITY.

THE WHOLESALE LOAN NET RECOVERY RATE WAS 0.06% IN

2005, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM A NET CHARGE-OFF RATE OF

0.18% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE TOTAL CONSUMER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.3 BILLION, $1.9

BILLION HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE MERGER, HIGHER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET

CHARGE-OFFS IN CARD SERVICES AND A $350 MILLION

SPECIAL PROVISION FOR HURRICANE KATRINA. ALSO

INCLUDED IN 2004 WERE ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY

ADJUSTMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. EXCLUDING

THESE ITEMS, THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO

SHOW STRENGTH IN CREDIT QUALITY.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2006 WAS $38.3

BILLION, DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

DECREASE WAS DUE TO MATERIAL LITIGATION-RELATED INSURANCE

RECOVERIES OF $512 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED WITH A

NET CHARGE OF $2.6 BILLION (INCLUDES $208 MILLION MATERIAL

LITIGATION-RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES) IN 2005, PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON AND

WORLDCOM CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN

OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER MERGER COSTS, THE

DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH, THE SALE OF THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS, AND MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND

OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET

MOSTLY BY HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND

INCREMENTAL EXPENSE OF $712 MILLION RELATED TO SFAS

123R, THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN

BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS HIGHER MARKETING

EXPENDITURES.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM 2005 WAS

PRIMARILY A RESULT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

INCENTIVES, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS

123R OF $712 MILLION FOR 2006, AND ADDITIONAL

HEADCOUNT IN CONNECTION WITH GROWTH IN BUSINESS

VOLUME, ACQUISITIONS, AND INVESTMENTS IN THE

BUSINESSES. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER EXPENSE

EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. FOR A DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R AND

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES SEE NOTE 8 ON PAGES

105107 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FROM 2005 WAS DUE

TO ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK, WHICH INCLUDED THE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE

FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK BRANCHES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER

OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS

AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE FOR 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO

HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES

SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY

INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES DECREASED FROM

2005 DUE TO MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES, LOWER LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH  SEVERAL LEGAL

MATTERS SETTLED IN 2005 AND THE PAYMENTECH

DECONSOLIDATION. THE DECREASE WAS OFFSET PARTLY BY

ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS GROWTH.

MARKETING EXPENSE WAS HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2005,

REFLECTING THE COSTS OF CAMPAIGNS FOR CREDIT

CARDS.

OTHER EXPENSE WAS LOWER DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGES OF $2.8 BILLION IN 2005,

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON AND

WORLDCOM CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER

MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

RECOGNIZED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $512 MILLION AND

$208 MILLION, IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY,

PERTAINING TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LITIGATION MATTERS.

FOR A FUR-

THER DISCUSSION OF LITIGATION, REFER TO NOTE 27 ON

PAGES 130131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

WERE CHARGES OF $93 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

TERMINATION OF A CLIENT CONTRACT IN TSS IN 2005;

AND IN RFS, THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY HIGHER CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER

LITIGATION, AND THE IMPACT OF GROWTH IN BUSINESS

VOLUME, ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE

BUSINESSES.

FOR DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND

MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 16 AND NOTE 9 ON PAGES

121123 AND 108, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2005 WAS $38.4 BILLION, UP

13% FROM 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FULL-YEAR

IMPACT OF THE MERGER. EXCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVE

CHARGES AND MERGER COSTS, NONINTEREST EXPENSE WOULD

HAVE BEEN $35.1 BILLION, UP 22%. IN ADDITION TO THE

MERGER, EXPENSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, CONTINUED INVESTMENT

SPENDING IN THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND INCREMENTAL

MARKETING EXPENSES RELATED TO LAUNCHING THE NEW

CHASE BRAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED

SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE

FIRM. EACH CATEGORY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS

AFFECTED BY THE MERGER. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW

HIGHLIGHT FACTORS OTHER THAN THE MERGER THAT

AFFECTED THE 2005 VERSUS 2004 COMPARISON.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES; ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT

DUE TO THE INSOURCING OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE (EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31,

2004, WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE TERMINATED THE FIRMS

OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH IBM); THE IMPACT OF

SEVERAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING CAZENOVE, HIGHBRIDGE

AND VASTERA; THE ACCELERATED VESTING OF CERTAIN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS; AND BUSINESS GROWTH. THE

EFFECT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE IBM OUTSOURCING

AGREEMENT WAS TO SHIFT EXPENSES FROM TECHNOLOGY AND

COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE

INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE

FIRM. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES, SEE NOTE 8 ON PAGES

105107 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE WAS DUE PRIMARILY

TO THE MERGER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CHARGES

FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE AND A NET RELEASE OF EXCESS

PROPERTY TAX ACCRUALS, AS COMPARED WITH $103

MILLION OF CHARGES FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE IN 2004.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE WAS DOWN

SLIGHTLY. THIS REDUCTION REFLECTS THE OFFSET OF SIX

MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS FOR 2004

AGAINST THE FULL-YEAR 2005 IMPACT FROM TERMINATION

OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH

IBM. THE REDUCTION IN TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS

EXPENSE DUE TO THE OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT

TERMINATION IS OFFSET MOSTLY BY INCREASES IN

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO ADDITIONAL

HEADCOUNT AND INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRMS HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE INFRASTRUCTURE.

PROFESSIONAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICES WERE HIGHER

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE

INSOURCING OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE, UPGRADES TO THE FIRMS SYSTEMS AND

TECHNOLOGY, AND BUSINESS GROWTH. THESE EXPENSES

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

MARKETING EXPENSE WAS HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AND

THE COST OF ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE NEW

CHASE BRAND.

30

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

THE DECREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE REFLECTED LOWER

LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES FOR CERTAIN MATERIAL

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN 2005: $1.9 BILLION RELATED TO

THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON CLASS ACTION LITIGATION

AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

AND $900 MILLION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WORLDCOM

CLASS ACTION LITIGATION; AND IN 2004, $3.7 BILLION

TO INCREASE LITIGATION RESERVES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE DECREASE WERE A $208 MILLION INSURANCE

RECOVERY RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LITIGATION,

LOWER SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT WRITE-OFFS,

MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

THESE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY $93 MILLION IN

CHARGES TAKEN BY TSS TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT

AND A $40 MILLION CHARGE TAKEN BY RFS RELATED TO

THE DISSOLUTION OF A STUDENT LOAN JOINT VENTURE.

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME COMBINED

WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WERE THE

LITIGATION CHARGES IN 2005 AND LOWER MERGER COSTS,

REFLECTING A TAX BENEFIT AT A 38% MARGINAL TAX

RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS RELATED TO TAX

AUDIT RESOLUTIONS OF $367 MILLION IN 2006.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX

INCOME COMBINED WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE LOWER 2005

LITIGATION CHARGES AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF

BROWNCO, WHICH WERE TAXED AT MARGINAL TAX RATES OF

38% AND 40%, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INCREASES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A TAX BENEFIT IN 2005 OF $55

MILLION RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE

REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

EXPLANATION

AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL  MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.

GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES

9093 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION,

WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED BASIS, PROVIDES

THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS

RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR

TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS

PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S. GAAP

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASES

PRESENTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS, WHICH

EXCLUDED MERGER COSTS AND MATERIAL LITIGATION

RESERVE CHARGES AND RECOVERIES FROM REPORTED

RESULTS, WAS ELIMINATED. THESE ITEMS HAD BEEN

EXCLUDED PREVIOUSLY FROM OPERATING RESULTS BECAUSE

THEY WERE DEEMED NONRECURRING; THEY ARE INCLUDED

NOW IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENTS RESULTS. IN

ADDITION, TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME NO

LONGER IS RECLASSIFIED FROM NET INTEREST INCOME TO

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A

REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS AND

THE LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS ON A MANAGED

BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE

FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE

REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUMES CREDIT CARD LOANS

SECURITIZED BY CS REMAIN ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND

PRESENTS REVENUE ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT

(FTE) BASIS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT HAVE ANY

IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE LINES OF

BUSINESS OR BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE.

THE PRESENTATION OF CS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS

ASSUMES THAT CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

SECURITIZED AND SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 140

STILL REMAIN ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND THAT THE

EARNINGS ON THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED IN

THE SAME MANNER AS THE EARNINGS ON RETAINED LOANS

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. JPMORGAN CHASE USES

THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED BASIS TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT

PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF

THE ENTIRE

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. OPERATIONS ARE

FUNDED AND DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING

RESOURCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED

UPON MANAGED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IN ADDITION,

THE SAME UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING RISK

MONITORING ARE USED FOR BOTH LOANS ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AND SECURITIZED LOANS. ALTHOUGH

SECURITIZATIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS THE

ONGOING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS THE CUSTOMERS

MAY CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS;

ACCORDINGLY, THE CUSTOMERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL

AFFECT BOTH THE SECURITIZED LOANS AND THE LOANS

RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. JPMORGAN CHASE

BELIEVES MANAGED BASIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO

INVESTORS, ENABLING THEM TO

UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE LOANS REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND THE

FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS. FOR

A RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS OF CS

RESULTS, SEE CARD SERVICES SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

4345 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION

REGARDING THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS, AND LOANS AND

RESIDUAL INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE

14 ON PAGES 114118 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON AN FTE BASIS.

ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS IS PRESENTED

IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO

TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE

COMPARABILITY OF REVENUES ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE

AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME

TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED

WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT BELIEVES

THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE

INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE

PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND THEREFORE

FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT

WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

33

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE-OF-BUSINESS

BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL

BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE

SEG-

MENTS ARE BASED UPON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY

REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION

IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF

THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED

BASIS. SEGMENT RESULTS FOR 2004 INCLUDE SIX MONTHS

OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A

STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. DURING 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE

MODIFIED CERTAIN OF ITS SEGMENT DISCLOSURES TO

REFLECT MORE CLOSELY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE MANAGED AND TO PROVIDE

IMPROVED COMPARABILITY WITH COMPETITORS. THESE

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE MODIFICATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN

THIS ANNUAL REPORT AND, EXCEPT AS INDICATED, THE

FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAS BEEN

REVISED TO REFLECT THE CHANGES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN

IN EFFECT THROUGHOUT ALL PERIODS REPORTED. A

SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES FOLLOWS.



THE PRESENTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2005 AND 2004 THAT EXCLUDED FROM REPORTED

RESULTS MERGER COSTS AND MATERIAL LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES AND RECOVERIES WAS ELIMINATED

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THESE ITEMS HAD BEEN EXCLUDED PREVIOUSLY FROM OPERATING RESULTS

BECAUSE THEY WERE DEEMED NONRECURRING; THEY ARE INCLUDED NOW IN THE CORPORATE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS RESULTS.



TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME IS NO LONGER RECLASSIFIED FROM NET INTEREST

INCOME TO PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.



VARIOUS WHOLESALE BANKING CLIENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE RELATED BALANCE SHEET AND

INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS, WERE TRANSFERRED AMONG CB, THE IB AND TSS.

THE PRIMARY CLIENT TRANSFER WAS CORPORATE MORTGAGE FINANCE FROM CB TO THE IB AND TSS.



TSS FIRMWIDE DISCLOSURES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A REFINED SET OF TSS PRODUCTS

AS WELL AS A REVISED ALLOCATION OF LIABILITY BALANCES AND LENDING- RELATED REVENUE RELATED

TO CERTAIN CLIENT TRANSFERS.



AS RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION WITH THE BANK OF NEW YORK, SELECTED CORPORATE RATE TRUST BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM TSS TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AND REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL

PERIODS REPORTED.

THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ALLOCATES INCOME AND

EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES

AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE

IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEGMENT REPORTING

METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE

REVENUES FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT

RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING (FTP) IS USED TO ALLOCATE

INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND

TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES

TO THE CORPORATE BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE ALLOCATION

PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND

CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK

AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SEGMENTS

STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY THE

FIRMS ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO). BUSINESS

SEGMENTS MAY RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURES, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, THAT

WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF A

SIMILAR PEER BUSINESS.

34

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER

COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM REFINED ITS

METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO

REFLECT THE NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS, CERTAIN

BUSINESS METRICS, SUCH AS ROE, ARE NOT COMPARABLE

TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATIONS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE, SEE CAPITAL

MANAGEMENTLINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGE 57 OF

THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY

SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE

SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THOSE EXPENSES ARE ALLOCATED BASED UPON

THEIR ACTUAL COST OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR

MARKET, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES

PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSES

RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO CER-

TAIN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED

TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN

CORPORATE. THESE RETAINED EXPENSES INCLUDE: PARENT

COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE

SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS

TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND

OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

DURING 2005, THE FIRM REFINED COST ALLOCATION

METHODOLOGIES RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE,

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS EXPENSES IN ORDER TO

IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY, CONSISTENCY AND

ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO COSTS ALLOCATED

ACROSS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT

REVISED TO REFLECT THIS METHODOLOGY CHANGE.

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO

EXPOSURES MANAGED BY THE IB ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

THAT THE SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER,

THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS REVISED TO BE

BASED UPON PRETAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF

CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE EXPOSURES.

THE DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE PERIODS SHOWN IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A

DECLINE IN TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME CAUSED BY A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

NONINTEREST-BEARING NET TRADING ASSETS TO TOTAL NET TRADING ASSETS, HIGHER FUNDING COSTS

COMPARED WITH PRIOR-YEAR PERIODS, AND SPREAD COMPRESSION DUE TO THE INVERTED YIELD CURVE

IN PLACE FOR MOST OF THE CURRENT YEAR.

(B)

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO

TAX-EXEMPT INCOME FROM MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS AND INCOME TAX CREDITS RELATED TO

AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS, OF $802 MILLION, $752 MILLION AND $274 MILLION FOR 2006,

2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

TSS IS CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES MANAGED

WITHIN THE IB CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION, SEE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT ON PAGE 35 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(D)

BEGINNING IN 2006, THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO IS

ADJUSTED TO PRESENT THIS RATIO AS IF SFAS 123R HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN EFFECT. IB MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTING THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO FOR THE

INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS 123R PROVIDES A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF IBS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO.

(E)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.7 BILLION WAS FLAT, AS RECORD

REVENUE OF $18.3 BILLION WAS OFFSET LARGELY BY

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF SFAS 123R, AND A PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $18.3 BILLION WAS UP $3.7

BILLION, OR 25%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES OF $5.5 BILLION WERE A RECORD, UP 35%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY RECORD DEBT AND

EQUITY UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS STRONG ADVISORY

FEES, WHICH WERE THE HIGHEST SINCE 2000. ADVISORY

ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS GAINS OR LOSSES ON SECURITIES RECEIVED AS PART OF A LOAN

RESTRUCTURING, FOR THE IBS CREDIT PORTFOLIO. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES THE

RESULTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT RELATED TO THE FIRMS LENDING AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES, AND

CHANGES IN THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), WHICH IS THE COMPONENT OF THE FAIR

VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE THAT REFLECTS THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. SEE PAGES

7072 OF THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

(D)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

WERE UP 31% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE AMERICAS.

DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.7 BILLION WERE UP 37%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY RECORD PERFORMANCE IN

BOTH LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND BOND UNDERWRITING.

EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF

$1.2 BILLION WERE UP 36% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN

BY GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS. FIXED INCOME MARKETS

REVENUE OF $8.4 BILLION WAS ALSO A RECORD, UP 15%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN CREDIT

MARKETS, EMERGING MARKETS AND CURRENCIES. RECORD

EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE OF $3.3 BILLION INCREASED

81%, AND WAS DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN CASH EQUITIES

AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE OF

$1.1 BILLION WAS DOWN 23%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $191 MILLION

COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $838 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTS

PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY; CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STABLE.

THE PRIOR-YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTED STRONG CREDIT

QUALITY, A DECLINE IN CRITICIZED AND NONPERFORMING

LOANS, AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF RECOVERIES.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $12.3 BILLION WAS UP

BY $2.6 BILLION, OR 26%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS

INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, AS WELL AS THE

INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS 123R.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 18% ON $20.8 BILLION OF

ALLOCATED CAPITAL COMPARED WITH 18% ON $20.0

BILLION IN 2005.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME OF $3.7 BILLION WAS UP 24%, OR $717

MILLION, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS

DRIVEN BY THE MERGER, HIGHER REVENUES AND AN

INCREASED BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. THESE FACTORS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE. RETURN ON EQUITY WAS

18%.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $14.6 BILLION WAS UP $2.0

BILLION, OR 16%, OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

STRONG FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS AND

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OF

$4.1 BILLION INCREASED 15% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN ADVISORY FEES RESULTING

IN PART FROM THE CAZENOVE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.

ADVISORY REVENUES OF $1.3 BILLION WERE UP 35% FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER MARKET VOLUMES.

DEBT UNDERWRITING REVENUES OF $2.0

36

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

BILLION INCREASED BY 6% DRIVEN BY STRONG LOAN

SYNDICATION FEES. EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $864

MILLION WERE UP 11% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY

IMPROVED MARKET SHARE. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE

OF $7.3 BILLION INCREASED 15%, OR $935 MILLION,

DRIVEN BY STRONGER, ALTHOUGH VOLATILE, TRADING

RESULTS ACROSS COMMODITIES, EMERGING MARKETS, RATE

MARKETS AND CURRENCIES. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUES

INCREASED 21% TO $1.8 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED COMMISSIONS, WHICH WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY LOWER TRADING RESULTS, WHICH ALSO EXPERIENCED A

HIGH LEVEL OF VOLATILITY. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES

WERE $1.4 BILLION, UP $213 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR DUE TO HIGHER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS AND

SALES AS WELL AS HIGHER TRADING REVENUE FROM CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF

$838 MILLION COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $640

MILLION IN 2004. THE INCREASED BENEFIT WAS DUE

PRIMARILY TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND REFLECTED NET RECOVERIES.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS OF $645 MILLION DECREASED BY

46% SINCE THE END OF 2004.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 12% TO $9.7

BILLION, LARGELY REFLECTING HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATED TO

GROWTH IN REVENUE. NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS UP

4% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT

OF THE CAZENOVE BUSINESS

PARTNERSHIP, WHILE THE OVERHEAD RATIO DECLINED TO

67% FOR 2005, FROM 69% IN 2004.

ASSIST THE READER IN COMPARING THE IBS ASSET AND CAPITAL LEVELS TO OTHER INVESTMENT BANKS IN THE

SECURITIES INDUSTRY. ASSET-TO-EQUITY LEVERAGE RATIOS ARE COMMONLY USED AS ONE MEASURE TO

ASSESS A COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE IB BELIEVES AN ADJUSTED ASSET AMOUNT THAT EXCLUDES

THE ASSETS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A LOW RISK PROFILE, PROVIDES A

TOTAL AVERAGE LOANS OF $80.6 BILLION INCREASED

BY $24.0 BILLION, OR 42%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

AVERAGE LOANS RETAINED OF $58.8 BILLION INCREASED

BY $14.0 BILLION, OR 31%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

DRIVEN BY HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITY. AVERAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE OF $21.7

BILLION WERE UP BY $10.0 BILLION, OR 85%, FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN THE IB

SECURITIZATION BUSINESSES.

IBS AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR

WAS $88 MILLION FOR BOTH 2006 AND 2005. THE

COMMODITIES AND OTHER VAR CATEGORY HAS INCREASED

FROM $21 MILLION ON AVERAGE FOR 2005 TO $45 MILLION

ON AVERAGE FOR 2006, REFLECTING THE BUILD-OUT OF

THE IB ENERGY BUSINESS, WHICH HAS ALSO INCREASED

THE EFFECT OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION SUCH THAT

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

OVERHEAD RATIO CALCULATION

RESULTS IN A HIGHER OVERHEAD RATIO IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND A LOWER OVERHEAD RATIO IN

LATER YEARS; THIS METHOD WOULD RESULT IN AN IMPROVING OVERHEAD RATIO OVER TIME, ALL THINGS

REMAINING EQUAL. THIS NON-GAAP RATIO EXCLUDES REGIONAL BANKINGS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND THE BANK ONE MERGER OF

$458 MILLION, $496 MILLION AND $264 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY.

(B)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.2 BILLION WAS DOWN BY $214

MILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. A DECLINE IN

MORTGAGE BANKING WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY IMPROVED

RESULTS IN REGIONAL BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $14.8 BILLION WAS FLAT

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME

OF $10.2 BILLION WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY DUE TO NARROWER

SPREADS ON LOANS AND DEPOSITS IN REGIONAL BANKING,

LOWER AUTO LOAN AND LEASE BALANCES AND THE SALE OF

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. THESE DECLINES WERE OFFSET

BY THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES

IN REGIONAL BANKING, WIDER LOAN SPREADS IN AUTO

FINANCE AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $4.7 BILLION WAS UP $35

MILLION, OR 1%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS

BENEFITED FROM INCREASES IN DEPOSIT-RELATED AND

BRANCH PRODUCTION FEES, HIGHER AUTOMOBILE OPERATING

LEASE REVENUE AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

THIS BENEFIT WAS OFFSET BY LOWER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE, THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE

BUSINESS AND LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS TRANSFERRED TO

HELD-FOR-SALE. IN 2006, LOSSES OF $233 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $120 MILLION IN 2005, WERE

RECOGNIZED IN REGIONAL BANKING RELATED TO MORTGAGE

LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE; AND LOSSES OF

$50 MILLION, COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $136 MILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WERE RECOGNIZED IN AUTO FINANCE

RELATED TO AUTOMOBILE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO

HELD-FOR-SALE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $561 MILLION WAS

DOWN BY $163

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION DUE TO THE

ABSENCE OF A $250 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA IN THE

PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTABLISHMENT

OF ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO

LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $8.9 BILLION WAS UP BY $342

MILLION, OR 4%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW

YORK TRANSACTION, THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE

FUNDING SERVICES, INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION

EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING

LEASES. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND

MERGER-RELATED AND OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND

THE ABSENCE OF A $40 MILLION PRIOR-YEAR CHARGE

RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A STUDENT LOAN JOINT

VENTURE.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME WAS $3.4 BILLION, UP $1.2 BILLION FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE LARGELY TO THE

MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED DEPOSIT

BALANCES AND WIDER SPREADS, HIGHER HOME EQUITY AND

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE BALANCES, AND EXPENSE SAVINGS IN

ALL BUSINESSES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON RETAINED LOAN

PORTFOLIOS, THE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR HURRICANE

KATRINA AND NET LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH PORTFOLIO

LOAN SALES IN REGIONAL BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED TO $14.8 BILLION, UP

$4.0 BILLION, OR 37%, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MERGER.

NET INTEREST INCOME OF $10.2 BILLION INCREASED BY

$2.5 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, INCREASED

DEPOSIT BALANCES AND WIDER SPREADS, AND GROWTH IN

RETAINED CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LOANS. THESE BENEFITS

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON LOAN

BALANCES AND THE ABSENCE OF LOAN PORTFOLIOS SOLD IN

LATE 2004 AND EARLY 2005. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF

$4.6 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.5 BILLION DUE TO THE

MERGER, IMPROVED MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS,

HIGHER AUTOMOBILE OPERATING LEASE INCOME AND

INCREASED

38

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET IN PART BY LOSSES ON PORTFOLIO

LOAN SALES IN REGIONAL BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED $724 MILLION, UP $275 MILLION, OR 61%,

FROM 2004. RESULTS INCLUDED A SPECIAL PROVISION IN 2005 FOR HURRICANE KATRINA

OF $250 MILLION AND A RELEASE IN 2004 OF $87 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO.

EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN

$62 MILLION, OR 12%. THE DECLINE REFLECTED REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT TRENDS IN MOST CONSUMER LENDING PORTFOLIOS

AND THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS IN RUN-OFF. THESE REDUCTIONS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY THE MERGER AND HIGHER PROVISION EXPENSE RELATED TO SUBPRIME

MORTGAGE LOANS RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE ROSE TO $8.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 BILLION FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MERGER. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED

CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RETAIL BANKING DISTRIBUTION AND SALES, INCREASED DEPRECIATION

EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES AND A $40 MILLION

CHARGE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A STUDENT LOAN JOINT VENTURE. EXPENSE

SAVINGS ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES PROVIDED A FAVORABLE OFFSET.

EQUITY LOANS; AND INCREASES IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES

AND CREDIT CARD SALES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS,

NARROWER SPREADS ON LOANS, AND A SHIFT TO

CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED BY $158 MILLION, PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF A $230 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION IN

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

MORTGAGE BANKING NET LOSS WAS $17 MILLION COMPARED

WITH NET INCOME OF $379 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $1.3 BILLION WAS DOWN BY $526

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A DECLINE IN NET

MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN

INCREASE IN PRODUCTION REVENUE. PRODUCTION REVENUE

WAS $833 MILLION, UP BY $89 MILLION, REFLECTING

INCREASED LOAN SALES AND WIDER GAIN ON SALE MARGINS

THAT BENEFITED FROM A SHIFT IN THE SALES MIX. NET

MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES LOAN

SERVICING REVENUE, MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND

OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WAS $481 MILLION

COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOAN

SERVICING REVENUE OF $2.3 BILLION INCREASED BY $185

MILLION ON A 13% INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY LOANS

SERVICED. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT REVENUE OF NEGATIVE

$379 MILLION WAS DOWN BY $655 MILLION FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF A $235 MILLION

NEGATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO THE MSR ASSET IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 DUE TO CHANGES AND

REFINEMENTS TO ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MSR

VALUATION MODEL. THIS RESULT ALSO REFLECTED A FULLY

HEDGED POSITION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. OTHER CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET, REPRESENTING RUNOFF

OF THE ASSET AGAINST THE REALIZATION OF SERVICING

CASH FLOWS, WERE NEGATIVE $1.4 BILLION. NONINTEREST

EXPENSE WAS $1.3 BILLION, UP BY $102 MILLION, OR

8%, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOAN

OFFICERS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

MORTGAGE BANKING NET INCOME WAS $379 MILLION COMPARED

WITH $269 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET REVENUE OF

$1.8 BILLION WAS UP BY $50 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. REVENUE COMPRISES PRODUCTION REVENUE AND NET

MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE. PRODUCTION REVENUE WAS

$744 MILLION, DOWN BY $172 MILLION, DUE TO AN 11%

DECREASE IN MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES LOAN SERVICING

REVENUE, MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND OTHER

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WAS $1.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$874 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOAN SERVICING

REVENUE OF $2.1 BILLION INCREASED BY $45 MILLION ON

AN 8% INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED. MSR

RISK MANAGEMENT REVENUE OF $276 MILLION WAS UP BY

$163 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING POSITIVE

RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS. OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

OF THE MSR ASSET, REPRESENTING RUNOFF OF THE ASSET

AGAINST THE REALIZATION OF SERVICING CASH FLOWS, WERE

NEGATIVE $1.3 BILLION. NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.2

BILLION WAS DOWN BY $125 MILLION, OR 9%, REFLECTING

LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUME AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

AS A RESULT OF THE INTEGRATION OF CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND PAYMENTECH

MERCHANT PROCESSING BUSINESSES INTO A JOINT VENTURE, BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2005, TOTAL NET REVENUE, TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE

HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO REFLECT THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO NET

OCCURRED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2004. THE EFFECT OF

THE DECONSOLIDATION WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL NET

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.2 BILLION WAS UP BY $1.3 BILLION,

OR 68%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS WERE DRIVEN

BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BANKRUPTCY FILINGS.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS OF $152.8 BILLION

INCREASED BY $10.6 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS OF $141.1 BILLION

INCREASED BY $4.7 BILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, BOTH AVERAGE

MANAGED AND END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS CONTINUED

TO BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY HIGHER CUSTOMER

PAYMENT RATES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGHER PAYMENT RATES ARE THE

NEW MINIMUM PAYMENT RULES AND A HIGHER PROPORTION

OF CUSTOMERS IN REWARDS-BASED PROGRAMS.

THE CURRENT YEAR BENEFITED FROM ORGANIC GROWTH AND

REFLECTED ACQUISITIONS OF TWO LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE

FIRST PORTFOLIO WAS THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD

BUSINESS, WHICH CLOSED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2005. THE SEARS CANADA PORTFOLIOS AVERAGE MANAGED

LOAN BALANCES WERE $2.1 BILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR

AND $291 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE SECOND

PURCHASE WAS THE KOHLS PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO,

WHICH CLOSED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. THE

KOHLS PORTFOLIO AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END MANAGED

LOAN BALANCES FOR 2006 WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $2.5

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TOTAL NET MANAGED REVENUE OF $14.7 BILLION WAS DOWN

BY $186 MILLION, OR 1% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME OF $11.8 BILLION WAS FLAT TO THE

PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME BENEFITED FROM AN

INCREASE IN AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES AND LOWER

REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CHARGE-OFFS. THESE

INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY ATTRITION OF MATURE,

HIGHER SPREAD BALANCES AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PAYMENT RATES AND HIGHER COST OF FUNDS ON BALANCE

GROWTH IN PROMOTIONAL, INTRODUCTORY AND TRANSACTOR

LOAN BALANCES, WHICH INCREASED DUE TO CONTINUED

INVESTMENT IN MARKETING. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF

$2.9 BILLION WAS DOWN

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2006 ANNUAL REPORT

43

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BY $197 MILLION, OR 6%. INTERCHANGE INCOME

INCREASED, BENEFITING FROM 12% HIGHER CHARGE

VOLUME, BUT WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY HIGHER

VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, INCLUDING

KOHLS, AND INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE (BOTH OF

WHICH ARE NETTED AGAINST INTERCHANGE INCOME).

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.6

BILLION, DOWN BY $2.7 BILLION, OR 37%, FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR. THIS BENEFIT WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT

DECREASE IN NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $2.4 BILLION,

REFLECTING THE CONTINUED LOW LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY

LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

CONTRACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE PROVISION ALSO

BENEFITED FROM A RELEASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR OF UNUSED RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANE

KATRINA, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE

IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE DECREASED TO 3.33%,

DOWN FROM 5.21% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY

MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 3.13%, UP FROM 2.79% IN

THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $5.1 BILLION WAS UP $476

MILLION, OR 10%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE LARGELY

TO HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING AND ACQUISITIONS

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MERGER SAVINGS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME OF $1.9 BILLION WAS UP $633 MILLION, OR

50%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, LOWER EXPENSES DRIVEN BY MERGER SAVINGS,

STRONGER UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY AND HIGHER

REVENUE FROM INCREASED LOAN BALANCES AND CHARGE

VOLUME WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE IMPACT OF

INCREASED BANKRUPTCIES.

NET MANAGED REVENUE WAS $14.9 BILLION, UP $4.5

BILLION, OR 43%. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $11.8

BILLION, UP $3.4 BILLION, OR 41%, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE MERGER, AND THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE LABEL

PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS AND THE

REVERSAL OF REVENUE RELATED TO INCREASED BANKRUPTCY

LOSSES. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $3.1 BILLION WAS UP

$1.0 BILLION, OR 50%, DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER

INTERCHANGE INCOME FROM HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO

PARTNERS AND HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARDS

PROGRAMS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $7.3 BILLION, UP

$2.5 BILLION, OR 51%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER,

AND INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE LABEL

PORTFOLIO. THE PROVISION ALSO INCREASED DUE TO

RECORD BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET CHARGE-OFFS RESULTING

FROM BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON OCTOBER 17, 2005. FINALLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES WAS INCREASED IN PART BY THE SPECIAL

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE

KATRINA. THESE FACTORS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

LOWER CONTRACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS. DESPITE A RECORD

LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY LOSSES, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

IMPROVED. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 5.21%,

DOWN FROM 5.27% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY

MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 2.79%, DOWN FROM 3.70%

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACCELERATED

LOSS RECOGNITION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS AS A RESULT

OF THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION AND STRONG

UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY.

UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE CUSTOMER

SEGMENTS, CB OFFERS SEVERAL PRODUCTS TO THE FIRMS

ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE.



CORPORATION.

WITH A LARGE CUSTOMER BASE ACROSS THESE SEGMENTS

AND PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CB LOAN

PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD

RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $1.0 BILLION INCREASED BY $59

MILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER

REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSE AND

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

RECORD NET REVENUE OF $3.8 BILLION INCREASED 9%, OR

$312 MILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED TO $2.7

BILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER LIABILITY

BALANCES AND LOAN VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOAN

SPREAD COMPRESSION AND A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD

LIABILITY PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.1

BILLION, UP $87 MILLION, OR 9%, DUE TO RECORD

IB-RELATED REVENUE AND HIGHER COMMERCIAL CARD

REVENUE.

REVENUE GREW FOR EACH CB BUSINESS COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED TREASURY SERVICES,

INVESTMENT BANKING AND LENDING REVENUE. COMPARED

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, MIDDLE MARKET BANKING REVENUE

OF $2.5 BILLION INCREASED BY $177 MILLION, OR 8%.

MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE OF $656 MILLION

INCREASED BY $105 MILLION, OR 19%, AND REAL ESTATE

BANKING REVENUE OF $458 MILLION INCREASED BY $24

MILLION, OR 6%.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $160 MILLION, UP

FROM $73 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO

LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A RELEASE OF THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE

SPECIAL RESERVE ESTABLISHED IN 2005 FOR HURRICANE

KATRINA. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE FLAT COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR. NONPERFORMING LOANS DECLINED 56%,

TO $121 MILLION.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $2.0 BILLION INCREASED

BY $123 MILLION, OR 7%, FROM LAST YEAR, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED

TO SFAS 123R AND INCREASED EXPENSE RESULTING FROM

HIGHER CLIENT USAGE OF TREASURY SERVICES PRODUCTS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME OF $951 MILLION WAS UP $390 MILLION,

OR 70%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE MERGER.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $3.5 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.2

BILLION, OR 53%, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER. IN ADDITION TO THE OVERALL INCREASE FROM

THE MERGER, NET INTEREST INCOME OF $2.5 BILLION WAS

POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY WIDER SPREADS ON HIGHER

VOLUME RELATED TO LIABILITY BALANCES AND INCREASED

LOAN VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER LOAN

SPREADS. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $986 MILLION WAS

POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE MERGER AND HIGHER IB

REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED

FEES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

EACH BUSINESS WITHIN CB DEMONSTRATED REVENUE GROWTH

OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER.

MIDDLE MARKET BANKING REVENUE WAS $2.4 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $861 MILLION, OR 58%, OVER THE PRIOR

YEAR; MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $551

MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $183 MILLION, OR 50%; AND

46

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

REAL ESTATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $434 MILLION,

UP $162 MILLION, OR 60%. IN ADDITION TO THE

MERGER, REVENUE WAS HIGHER FOR EACH BUSINESS DUE

TO WIDER SPREADS AND HIGHER VOLUME RELATED TO

LIABILITY BALANCES AND INCREASED INVESTMENT

BANKING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER LOAN

SPREADS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $73 MILLION

INCREASED BY $32 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A

SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA,

INCREASED LOAN BALANCES AND REFINEMENTS IN THE

DATA USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS

STRONG WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $26 MILLION, DOWN

$35 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AND NONPERFORMING

LOANS OF $272 MILLION WERE DOWN $255 MILLION, OR

48%.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.9 BILLION

INCREASED BY $530 MILLION, OR 40%, PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE MERGER AND TO AN INCREASE IN ALLOCATED UNIT

COSTS FOR TREASURY SERVICES PRODUCTS.

TO SFAS 123R, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF

PRIOR-YEAR CHARGES OF $93 MILLION RELATED TO THE

TERMINATION OF A CLIENT CONTRACT.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME WAS $863 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $586

MILLION, OR 212%. PRIMARILY DRIVING THE IMPROVEMENT

IN REVENUE WERE THE MERGER, BUSINESS GROWTH, AND

WIDENING SPREADS ON AND GROWTH IN AVERAGE LIABILITY

BALANCES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

RESULTS FOR 2005 ALSO INCLUDED CHARGES OF $58

MILLION (AFTER-TAX) TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT.

RESULTS FOR 2004 ALSO INCLUDED SOFTWARE-IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES OF $97 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) AND A GAIN OF

$10 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) ON THE SALE OF A BUSINESS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $5.5 BILLION INCREASED $1.3

BILLION, OR 32%. NET INTEREST INCOME GREW TO $1.9

BILLION, UP $655 MILLION, DUE TO WIDER SPREADS ON

LIABILITY BALANCES, A CHANGE IN THE CORPORATE

DEPOSIT PRICING METHODOLOGY IN 2004 AND GROWTH IN

AVERAGE LIABILITY BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF

$3.7 BILLION INCREASED BY $686 MILLION, OR 23%, DUE

TO PRODUCT GROWTH ACROSS TSS, THE MERGER AND THE

ACQUISITION OF VASTERA. LEADING THE PRODUCT REVENUE

GROWTH WAS AN INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY TO

$10.7 TRILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MARKET VALUE

APPRECIATION AND NEW BUSINESS, ALONG WITH GROWTH IN

WHOLESALE CARD, SECURITIES LENDING, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, TRADE, CLEARING AND ACH REVENUES.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS GROWTH IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS A DECLINE IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DUE

TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND THE ABSENCE, IN THE

CURRENT PERIOD, OF A GAIN ON THE SALE OF A

BUSINESS.

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME WAS A RECORD $1.4 BILLION, UP BY $193

MILLION, OR 16%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IMPROVED

RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R AND THE ABSENCE OF A TAX CREDIT

RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS A RECORD $6.8 BILLION, UP BY

$1.1 BILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST REVENUE, PRINCIPALLY FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, OF $5.8 BILLION WAS UP BY $1.2

BILLION, OR 27%. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE LARGELY TO

INCREASED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. NET INTEREST

INCOME WAS $971 MILLION, DOWN BY $110 MILLION, OR

10%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE WAS DUE

PRIMARILY TO NARROWER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS

AND THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES.

INSTITUTIONAL REVENUE GREW 41%, TO $2.0 BILLION,

DUE TO NET ASSET INFLOWS AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE

FEES. PRIVATE BANK REVENUE GREW 13%, TO $1.9

BILLION, DUE TO INCREASED PLACEMENT ACTIVITY,

HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES AND HIGHER DEPOSIT

BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER AVERAGE

SPREADS ON DEPOSITS. RETAIL REVENUE GREW 22%, TO

$1.9 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET ASSET INFLOWS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF BROWNCO. PRIVATE

CLIENT SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED 1%, TO $1.0

BILLION, AS HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES WERE

MORE THAN OFFSET BY NARROWER AVERAGE DEPOSIT AND

LOAN SPREADS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $28

MILLION COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $56 MILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTS A

HIGH LEVEL OF RECOVERIES AND STABLE CREDIT QUALITY.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $4.6 BILLION WAS UP

BY $718 MILLION, OR 19%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS

123R, INCREASED SALARIES AND BENEFITS RELATED TO

BUSINESS GROWTH, AND HIGHER MINORITY INTEREST

EXPENSE RELATED TO HIGHBRIDGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NET INCOME OF $1.2 BILLION WAS UP $535 MILLION

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE MERGER AND

INCREASED REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $5.7 BILLION, UP $1.5

BILLION, OR 36%. NONINTEREST REVENUE, PRIMARILY

FEES AND COMMISSIONS, OF $4.6 BILLION WAS UP $1.2

BILLION, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE MERGER, THE

ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE IN

2004, NET ASSET INFLOWS AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET

APPRECIATION. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $1.1 BILLION

WAS UP $285 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER,

HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY NARROWER DEPOSIT SPREADS.

PRIVATE BANK REVENUE GREW 9%, TO $1.7 BILLION.

RETAIL REVENUE GREW 30%, TO $1.5 BILLION.

INSTITUTIONAL REVENUE GREW 57%, TO $1.4 BILLION,

DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN

HIGHBRIDGE. PRIVATE CLIENT SERVICES REVENUE GREW

88%, TO $1.0 BILLION.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $56

MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $14 MILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS

AND REFINEMENTS IN THE DATA USED TO ESTIMATE THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $3.9 BILLION INCREASED

BY $727 MILLION, OR 23%, REFLECTING THE MERGER, THE

ACQUISITION OF HIGHBRIDGE AND INCREASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME WAS $842 MILLION COMPARED WITH A NET

LOSS OF $3.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IN

COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIVATE EQUITY

EARNINGS WAS $627 MILLION, DOWN FROM $821 MILLION;

TREASURY NET LOSS WAS $560 MILLION COMPARED WITH A

NET LOSS OF $2.0 BILLION; THE NET LOSS IN OTHER

IMPROVEMENT, WITH NET INTEREST INCOME OF NEGATIVE

$140 MILLION COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE $1.7 BILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR, BENEFITING PRIMARILY FROM AN

IMPROVEMENT IN TREASURYS NET INTEREST SPREAD AND

AN INCREASE IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$1.6 BILLION, REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF THE $1.3

BILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO LAST YEAR AND

LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS OF $1.3 BILLION COMPARED

WITH GAINS OF $1.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE

DECLINES WERE OFFSET BY $619 MILLION IN SECURITIES

$103 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF MASTERCARD

SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN THE

EXPENSE INCLUDED A $145 MILLION COST DUE TO THE

ACCELERATED VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS. MERGER COSTS

WERE $305 MILLION COMPARED WITH $722 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES

SOLD TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK ON OCTOBER 1, 2006.

PRIOR TO THE SALE, THE SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST

MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INCOME FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR 2006 ALSO INCLUDED A

ONE-TIME GAIN OF $622 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE

OF THESE BUSINESSES.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS A NEGATIVE $1.1 BILLION

COMPARED WITH TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $769 MILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $1.6 BILLION

DECREASED BY $363 MILLION AND INCLUDED SECURITIES

LOSSES OF $1.5 BILLION DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.

REPOSITIONING OF THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES; THE GAIN ON

THE SALE OF BROWNCO OF $1.3 BILLION; AND THE

INCREASE IN PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS OF $262 MILLION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS A LOSS OF $2.8

BILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $1.2 BILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. ACTIONS AND POLICIES ADOPTED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER AND THE REPOSITIONING

OF THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WERE THE

MAIN DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED LOSS.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.3 BILLION, DOWN

$1.1 BILLION FROM $6.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. MATERIAL LITIGATION

CHARGES WERE $2.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.7

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. MERGER COSTS WERE $722

MILLION COMPARED WITH $1.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET PRIMARILY BY THE

COST OF ACCELERATED VESTING OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE AND IBM

ANNOUNCED THE FIRMS PLANS TO REINTEGRATE THE

PORTIONS OF ITS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE 

INCLUDING DATA CENTERS, HELP DESKS, DISTRIBUTED

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS WERE

$1.4 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $152.6 BILLION, OR

13%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005. TOTAL LIABILITIES

WERE $1.2 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $144.0 BILLION,

OR 13%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005. STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY WAS $115.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $8.6 BILLION, OR 8% FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE

FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS DURING 2006.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES BORROWED; FEDERAL

FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM UTILIZES FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES

PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES

BORROWED, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AS PART OF ITS

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, IN ORDER TO MANAGE

THE FIRMS CASH POSITIONS, RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, AND TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS AND

MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS. IN 2006, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD

INCREASED IN CONNECTION WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF FUNDS

THAT WERE AVAILABLE FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS

TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS AND AFS SECURITIES

INVENTORY LEVELS, AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF GROWTH

IN VOLUME RELATED TO SWEEPS AND OTHER CASH

MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES

6263 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRM USES DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS

FOR BOTH MARKET-MAKING AND PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING

ACTIVITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES (INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND

CORPORATE DEBT), EQUITY SECURITIES AND CONVERTIBLE

CASH INSTRUMENTS, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COMMODITIES.

THE INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS OVER DECEMBER 31,

2005, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MORE FAVORABLE

CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, WITH GROWTH IN

CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ACROSS BOTH

PRODUCTS (SUCH AS INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND EQUITY

MARKETS) AND REGIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,

REFER TO NOTE 4 ON PAGE 98 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM UTILIZES VARIOUS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, EQUITY, CREDIT AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES

FOR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING AND

RISK-MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE INCREASES IN

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES FROM DECEMBER

31, 2005, PRIMARILY STEMMED FROM AN INCREASE IN

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND EQUITY CONTRACTS. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND NOTE 4 ON

PAGES 69-72 AND 98,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

THE FIRMS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, ALMOST ALL OF

WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS AFS, IS USED PRIMARILY TO

MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

MOVEMENTS. THE AFS PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY $44.4

BILLION FROM THE 2005 YEAR END, PRIMARILY DUE TO

NET PURCHASES IN THE TREASURY INVESTMENT SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO, IN CONNECTION WITH REPOSITIONING THE

FIRMS PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO

SECURITIES, REFER TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION AND TO NOTE 10 ON PAGES 5354 AND

108111, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AND BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AND BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES DECLINED FROM

DECEMBER 2005, AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 OF

FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THE

RESTRUCTURING RESULTED IN THE DECONSOLIDATION OF

$29 BILLION OF INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES,

$3 BILLION OF LOANS AND $1 BILLION OF AFS

SECURITIES, AS WELL AS A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY

CONSOLIDATED VIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RELATED TO MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, REFER TO

OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL

CASH OBLIGATIONS ON PAGES 5960 AND NOTE 15 ON

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

LOANS

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES,

FROM LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL

CONSUMERS. THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD

RELATIONSHIP OF EACH PORTFOLIO AND DISCOURAGES THE

RETENTION OF LOAN ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A

POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED

CAPITAL. THE $63.8 BILLION INCREASE IN LOANS, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE

OF $33.6 BILLION IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, MAINLY

IN THE IB, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL

MARKETS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FINANCINGS ASSOCIATED

WITH CLIENT ACQUISITIONS, SECURITIZATIONS AND LOAN

SYNDICATIONS. CB LOANS ALSO INCREASED AS A RESULT

OF ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION. THE $30.3 BILLION INCREASE IN CONSUMER

LOANS WAS DUE LARGELY TO INCREASES IN CS

(REFLECTING STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH, A REDUCTION IN

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, AND THE

ACQUISITIONS OF PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIOS), INCREASES IN EDUCATION LOANS RESULTING

FROM THE 2006 FIRST-QUARTER ACQUISITION OF

COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE

BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. THESE INCREASES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A DECLINE IN AUTO LOANS AND

LEASES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED

$189 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005. FOR A

MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 6476 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ARISES FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF AN ACQUIRED

ENTITY OVER THE NET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE $1.6

BILLION INCREASE IN GOODWILL PRIMARILY RESULTED

FROM THE ADDITION OF $1.8 BILLION OF GOODWILL FROM

THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION IN THE 2006

FOURTH QUARTER AND FROM THE 2006 FIRST-QUARTER

ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL WERE

REDUCTIONS OF $402 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SALE

OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES TO THE BANK

OF NEW YORK; PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2005 FOURTH-QUARTER

ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD

BUSINESS; THE 2006 SECOND QUARTER SALE OF THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS; AND A REDUCTION RELATED TO

RECLASSIFYING NET ASSETS OF A SUBSIDIARY AS

HELD-FOR-SALE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE

NOTES 3 AND 16 ON PAGES 97 AND 121123 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE FIRMS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS), PURCHASED

CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, OTHER CREDIT

CARDRELATED INTANGIBLES, CORE DEPOSIT

INTANGIBLES, AND ALL OTHER INTANGIBLES. THE $293

MILLION INCREASE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

PRIMARILY REFLECTS HIGHER MSRS DUE TO GROWTH IN THE

SERVICING PORTFOLIO, THE ADDITION OF CORE DEPOSIT

INTANGIBLES FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION

AND PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE

SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE THE AMORTIZATION OF

INTANGIBLES AND A $436 MILLION REDUCTION IN OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF

SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES TO THE BANK OF

NEW YORK. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE NOTES 3 AND 16 ON

PAGES 97 AND 121123 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DEPOSITS

THE FIRMS DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO

CUSTOMERS, BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE, FOR FUNDS

HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS ARE GENERALLY

CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION (U.S. AND NON-U.S.), WHETHER

THEY ARE INTEREST- OR NONINTEREST-BEARING, AND BY

TYPE (DEMAND, MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS

(MMDAS), SAVINGS, TIME, NEGOTIABLE ORDER OF

WITHDRAWAL (NOW) ACCOUNTS), AND HELP PROVIDE A

STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO THE

FIRM. DEPOSITS INCREASED BY 15% FROM DECEMBER 31,

2005. GROWTH IN RETAIL DEPOSITS REFLECTED THE BANK

OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION, NEW ACCOUNT ACQUISITIONS,

AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL BRANCH

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. WHOLESALE DEPOSITS INCREASED

DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE GROWTH IN WHOLESALE DEPOSITS WAS A

$24.0 BILLION DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF

SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES TO THE BANK OF

NEW YORK. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DEPOSITS, REFER

TO THE RFS SEGMENT DISCUSSION AND THE LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 3842 AND

6263, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR

MORE INFORMATION ON WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES,

INCLUDING DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 4647 AND 4849,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

THE FIRM UTILIZES LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AS PART OF ITS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES INCREASED BY $25.7 BILLION, OR 21%, FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET NEW

ISSUANCES. CONTINUED STRONG FOREIGN INVESTOR

PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL CORPORATE MARKETS

ALLOWED JPMORGAN CHASE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE

OPPORTUNITIES GLOBALLY TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY ITS

FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES. DURING 2006, JPMORGAN

CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $56.7 BILLION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. THESE ISSUANCES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY $34.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES THAT MATURED OR

WERE REDEEMED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 6263 AND NOTE

19 ON PAGES 124125 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $8.6

BILLION, OR 8%, FROM YEAR-END 2005 TO $115.8 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF NET INCOME FOR 2006 AND NET SHARES

ISSUED UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS, STOCK REPURCHASES, A

CHARGE OF $1.1 BILLION TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) RELATED TO THE

PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION, AS REQUIRED ON DECEMBER 31,

2006, OF SFAS 158 FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS

INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CAPITAL SUFFICIENT

TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AS MEASURED BY ECONOMIC RISK

CAPITAL, AND TO MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS

UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL ABOVE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN

AMOUNTS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE MANAGEMENTS

REGULATORY AND DEBT RATING OBJECTIVES. THE PROCESS

OF ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IS

INTEGRATED INTO THE FIRMS CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND IS

OVERSEEN BY ALCO.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS;



MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT

WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING

SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK

MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. RETURN ON

EQUITY IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR

EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS A KEY MEASURE

OF A BUSINESS SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM REFINED ITS

METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO THE LINES OF

BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THIS REFINEMENT, RFS, CS,

CB, TSS AND AM HAD HIGHER AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL

ALLOCATED TO THEM COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2006. THE REVISED METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS FOR EACH

LINE OF BUSINESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LINE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

SINCE THE MERGER. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE REVISED

METHODOLOGY ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LINES OF

BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS ON THE AMOUNT OF

CAPITAL SUPPORTING ACQUISITION-RELATED GOODWILL. AS

PART OF THIS REFINEMENT IN THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION

METHODOLOGY, THE FIRM ASSIGNED TO THE CORPORATE

SEGMENT AN AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL EQUAL TO THE

THEN-CURRENT BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL FROM AND PRIOR

TO THE MERGER. AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN

REVISED TO REFLECT THE NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS,

CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF

BUSINESS FOR 2006 IS NOT COMPARABLE TO PRIOR

PERIODS; AND CERTAIN BUSINESS METRICS, SUCH AS ROE,

ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE

FIRM MAY REVISE ITS EQUITY CAPITAL-ALLOCATION

METHODOLOGY AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142, THE LINES OF BUSINESS

PERFORM THE REQUIRED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT

TESTING, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND NOTE

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR

THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) AND

CONSUMER BUSINESSES (RFS AND CS).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE

CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND DECLINES IN

MARKET VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION, MEASURED

OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL

CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVEL OF CAPITALIZATION

NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A TARGETED AA SOLVENCY

STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE IN EXCESS OF THOSE

FOR WHICH PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE

MAINTAINED. IN ADDITION TO MATURITY AND

CORRELATIONS, CAPITAL ALLOCATION IS BASED UPON

SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE

AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), LIKELIHOOD

OF DEFAULT, LOSS SEVERITY AND MARKET CREDIT SPREAD.



LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE IN AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION IS REPRESENTED BY THE EXPECTED POSITIVE EXPOSURE BASED UPON POTENTIAL

MOVEMENTS OF UNDERLYING MARKET RATES. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR UNUSED REVOLVING

CREDIT FACILITIES REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT

EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED UPON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR.



DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS FOR ALL INVESTMENT BANK

CLIENTS BY REFERENCING EQUITY AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER

PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT IB CLIENTS. THIS METHODOLOGY FACILITATES, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, MORE ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT BY UTILIZING

A DYNAMIC, FORWARD-LOOKING MEASURE OF CREDIT. THIS MEASURE CHANGES WITH THE CREDIT CYCLE

OVER TIME, IMPACTING THE LEVEL OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL. FOR PRIVATELY HELD FIRMS AND

INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANK AND ASSET MANAGEMENT, DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD IS BASED UPON

LONGER-TERM AVERAGES THROUGH THE CREDIT CYCLES.



LOSS SEVERITY OF EXPOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

DURING WORKOUTS, WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR COLLATERAL OR SUBORDINATION.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS

BASED UPON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK

SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND

SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL

EQUIVALENT TO THE AA SOLVENCY STANDARD.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PORTFOLIOS ARE ADJUSTED TO ENSURE THAT CAPITAL

IS CONSISTENT WITH EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS, SUCH AS

SUBORDINATION LEVELS ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR

CAPITAL HELD AT REPRESENTATIVE MONOLINE

COMPETITORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY

THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE RISK

OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN MARKET

VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, SECURITIES PRICES AND

COMMODITIES PRICES. DAILY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR),

MONTHLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE

USED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. THE

FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT

SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES. SEE MARKET

RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7780 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK

MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR

OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL

RISK ON A BOTTOM-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED UPON ACTUAL LOSSES AND

POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

OR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM

BELIEVES THE MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL

II FRAMEWORK AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT EVENTUALLY

FOR QUALIFICATION UNDER THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT

APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY- AND

PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND

INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY

PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED

WITH A DECLINE IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET

DEVALUATIONS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FIRMS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, ESTABLISHES CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS

FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)

ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

ON DECEMBER 14, 2006, THE FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORY AGENCIES ANNOUNCED AN INTERIM DECISION

THAT SFAS 158 WILL NOT IMPACT REGULATORY CAPITAL.

UNTIL FURTHER GUIDANCE IS ISSUED, ANY AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS) WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY RELATED TO THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 158 WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM

REGULATORY CAPITAL. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SFAS

158, REFER TO NOTE 7 ON PAGES 100105 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT

PROVIDES REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF FOR CERTAIN CASH-COLLATERALIZED, SECURITIES-BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS. THE FINAL RULE, WHICH BECAME

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 22, 2006, ALSO BROADENS THE

TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS QUALIFYING FOR REGULATORY

CAPITAL RELIEF UNDER THE INTERIM RULE. ADOPTION OF

THE RULE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS CAPITAL RATIOS.

ON MARCH 1, 2005, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED

A FINAL RULE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL 11,

2005, THAT CONTINUES THE INCLUSION OF TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO

STRICTER QUANTITATIVE LIMITS AND REVISED

QUALITATIVE STANDARDS, AND BROADENS THE DEFINITION

OF RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS. THE RULE

PROVIDES FOR A FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. AS AN

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANY,

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE RULES LIMITATION

ON RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING

TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, TO 15% OF TOTAL CORE

CAPITAL ELEMENTS, NET OF GOODWILL LESS ANY

ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, JPMORGAN CHASES RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL

ELEMENTS WERE 15.1% OF TOTAL CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS.

BASEL II

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION

PUBLISHED THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IN 2004 IN AN

EFFORT TO UPDATE THE ORIGINAL INTERNATIONAL BANK

CAPITAL ACCORD (BASEL I), WHICH HAS BEEN IN

EFFECT SINCE 1988. THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II

FRAMEWORK IS TO MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL MORE RISK-SENSITIVE, AND PROMOTE ENHANCED

RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE,

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

INCORPORATING THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE

EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. JPMORGAN

CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED

MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN THE U.S., COMMENCING IN

2009, BY EMPLOYING INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN

KEY RISK DRIVERS TO DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

PRIOR TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II

FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

DEMONSTRATE TO ITS U.S. BANK SUPERVISORS THAT ITS

INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY

STANDARDS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN

COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES WITH

ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES. DURING 2007 AND 2008,

THE FIRM WILL ADOPT BASEL II RULES IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

DIVIDENDS

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND POLICY

REFLECTS JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS OUTLOOK, DESIRED

DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS, NEED TO MAINTAIN AN

ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVEL AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. IN 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE DECLARED

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK OF

$0.34 PER SHARE. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO TARGET A

DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO OF 30-40% OF NET INCOME OVER

TIME.

STOCK REPURCHASES

ON MARCH 21, 2006, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES

THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $8 BILLION OF THE FIRMS

COMMON SHARES, WHICH SUPERCEDES A $6 BILLION STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2004. THE $8 BILLION

AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO

OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES

REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS,

INCLUDING: MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE

ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL

GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT

INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY

BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING

RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY

TIME.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, UNDER THE

RESPECTIVE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS THEN IN

EFFECT, THE FIRM REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 91 MILLION

SHARES FOR $3.9 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER

SHARE OF $43.41. UNDER THE ORIGINAL $6 BILLION

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, DURING 2005, THE FIRM

REPURCHASED 94 MILLION SHARES FOR $3.4 BILLION AT

AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $36.46.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, $5.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED

REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED UNDER THE CURRENT STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT IT MAY, FROM TIME TO

TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE

10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO

FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE

10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO

REPURCHASE SHARES DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT

OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR

EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT

PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN

MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS

ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL

NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES

OF OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), LINES OF CREDIT

AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. THE PRINCIPAL USES OF SPES

ARE TO OBTAIN SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FOR JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL

ASSETS, AND TO CREATE OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR

CLIENTS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART

OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET

LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. FOR

EXAMPLE, SPES ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MARKETS FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING

ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF

THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. TO

INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CREDITORS OF OTHER

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER OF ASSETS, SPES ARE

GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SPES IN THREE BROAD

CATEGORIES: LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION. CAPITAL IS

HELD, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL

SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES,

SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES AND THE

FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TYPES OF EXPOSURES, SEE

NOTE 1 ON PAGE 94, NOTE 15 ON PAGES 118120 AND

NOTE 16 ON PAGES 121123 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK

TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT

ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT

WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS

PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS

INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE

FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT

EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF

THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR

FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE

FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A. WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS,

PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD &

POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF

THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WAS $74.4 BILLION AND

$71.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A. WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE

REPLACED BY ANOTHER LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF

PROVIDING FUNDING

UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT, OR, IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR

REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE IN ORDER TO

PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

OF THE $74.4 BILLION IN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO

SPES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, $74.0 BILLION WAS

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS

TO EXTEND CREDIT AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AS

SHOWN IN THE TABLE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE. OF THE $71.3 BILLION

OF LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, $38.9 BILLION WAS INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OF THESE COMMITMENTS,

$356 MILLION AND $32.4 BILLION HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED

FROM THE TABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OF THE SPES

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AS REQUIRED UNDER FIN 46R.

THE DECREASE FROM THE 2005 YEAR END IS DUE TO THE

DECONSOLIDATION DURING THE 2006 SECOND QUARTER OF

SEVERAL MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ADMINISTRATED BY THE

FIRM. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 15 ON

PAGES 118120 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN SPES

ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS; THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE (I.E., MARK-TO-MARKET (MTM) GAINS

AND LOSSES) RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS.

SUCH MTM GAINS AND LOSSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

REVENUE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN REVENUE

INFORMATION RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED AND

NONCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES)

WITH WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT,

AND QUALIFYING SPES (QSPES). THE REVENUE REPORTED

IN THE TABLE BELOW PRIMARILY REPRESENTS SERVICING

AND CREDIT FEE INCOME. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS

CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW

DOWN THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO

FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE

COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT.

MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE

WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN.

AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW,

REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE

OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONSUMER

FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE

OPTION OF THE FIRM. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE

FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 6476 AND NOTE 29 ON PAGES

132134 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM

ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT

MAY REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. COMMITMENTS FOR

FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE FUTURE SERVICES AND CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES RELATED TO REAL ESTATERELATED

OBLIGATIONS AND EQUIPMENT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE SUMMARIZES, BY REMAINING

MATURITY, JPMORGAN CHASES OFFBALANCE SHEET

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

DECEMBER 31, 2006. CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES AND

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE TABLE BELOW REFLECT THE

MINIMUM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION UNDER LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE BOTH

FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING

TABLE ARE A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS TO BE SETTLED IN

CASH, PRIMARILY IN UNDER ONE YEAR. THESE

OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INCLUDE FEDERAL

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO

PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING

MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN ITS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT

RISK IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS SOUNDNESS AND

PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION.

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS

DEALINGS, INCLUDING LENDING, TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, IS IDENTIFIED AND

AGGREGATED THROUGH THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE.



RISK MEASUREMENT.

THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING

CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS

TESTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUTINELY REVIEWED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK

ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECT UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL.

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

INCORPORATE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING.

RISK REPORTING IS EXECUTED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED

BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE.

THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK,

CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK,

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND

REPUTATION RISK, AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STARTS WITH

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR

MANAGING ITS OWN RISK. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS

WORKS CLOSELY WITH RISK MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM,

THROUGH ITS OWN RISK COMMITTEE AND, IN MOST

CASES, ITS OWN CHIEF RISK OFFICER. EACH RISK

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING

THE BUSINESS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND

CONTROLS.

OVERLAYING THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT

ARE FIVE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK

MANAGEMENTRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE, TREASURY, CHIEF

INVESTMENT OFFICE, OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

APPROVING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY, INCLUDING

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANNING AND EXPOSURE TO SPES

(AND ANY REQUIRED LIQUIDITY SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF

SUCH SPES). THE COMMITTEE ALSO OVERSEES THE FIRMS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF BUSINESS TRANSFER

INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK TO TREASURY IN

THE CORPORATE SEGMENT). THE COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED

OF THE FIRMS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CORPORATE

TREASURER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF EACH

LINE OF BUSINESS.

TREASURY AND THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING

AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE

AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL HAS OVERSIGHT

FOR LEGAL AND REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISKS.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A

FIRMWIDE FUNCTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS.

WITHIN RISK MANAGEMENT ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR

CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AS WELL AS RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS. RISK

MANAGEMENT SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK POLICY

AND METHODOLOGY, RISK REPORTING AND RISK EDUCATION;

AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR BUILDING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE

AND REPORTS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE BOARDS

RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE

PERSON WHO FILLED THE POSITION OF CHIEF RISK

OFFICER DURING 2006 RETIRED AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

UNTIL HIS REPLACEMENT IS NAMED, THE FIRMS CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS ACTING AS THE INTERIM CHIEF

RISK OFFICER.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF

BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CORPORATE

FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT

COMMITTEE, WHICH OVERSEES GLOBAL MERGER AND

ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN

CHASE FOR ITS OWN INVESTMENT ACCOUNT, THAT FALL

OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND

OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

61

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT

OF RISK MANAGEMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARDS

RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE RISK

POLICY COMMITTEE OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT

RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING

MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE

POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT

OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE PROCESS

BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS

UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED

UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK ARISES FROM THE GENERAL FUNDING

NEEDS OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE

MANAGEMENT OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. JPMORGAN

CHASES LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED

TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS AND MINIMIZE FUNDING

COSTS. THROUGH ACTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT THE FIRM

SEEKS TO PRESERVE STABLE, RELIABLE AND

COST-EFFECTIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. THIS ACCESS

ENABLES THE FIRM TO REPLACE MATURING OBLIGATIONS

WHEN DUE AND FUND ASSETS AT APPROPRIATE MATURITIES

AND RATES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, MANAGEMENT USES A

VARIETY OF MEASURES TO MITIGATE LIQUIDITY AND

RELATED RISKS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MARKET

CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, LIQUIDITY

NEEDS AND THE DESIRED MATURITY PROFILE OF

LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

THE THREE PRIMARY MEASURES OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM POSITION.

HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM POSITION MEASURES

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO REPAY ALL OBLIGATIONS WITH A MATURITY OF LESS THAN

ONE YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE

PARENT COMPANY IS CONSTRAINED.



CASH CAPITAL POSITION.

CASH CAPITAL POSITION IS A MEASURE INTENDED TO ENSURE THE

ILLIQUID PORTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET CAN BE FUNDED BY EQUITY, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND DEPOSITS THE FIRM BELIEVES TO BE CORE.



BASIC SURPLUS.

BASIC SURPLUS MEASURES THE BANKS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN A 90- DAY STRESS

EVENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRM WHERE NO NEW FUNDING CAN BE RAISED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS

AS THEY COME DUE.

LIQUIDITY IS MANAGED SO THAT, BASED UPON THE

MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THERE IS SUFFICIENT SURPLUS LIQUIDITY.

AN EXTENSION OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THE FIRMS

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE GOAL OF THE PLAN IS

TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY DURING NORMAL AND

STRESS PERIODS. THE PLAN CONSIDERS NUMEROUS

TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS WHERE

ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS SEVERELY LIMITED OR

NONEXISTENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ON AND

OFFBALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, SEPARATELY EVALUATING

ACCESS TO FUNDS BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY,

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

PART OF THE FIRMS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IS ITS

RATINGS DOWNGRADE ANALYSIS. FOR THIS ANALYSIS, THE

IMPACT OF NUMEROUS RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADE

SCENARIOS ARE CONSIDERED.

THE VARIOUS ANALYTICS USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY AND RELATED RISKS RELY ON MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT REGARDING JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO

LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR USE ASSETS AS COLLATERAL FOR

BORROWINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL DATA ON

THE FUNDING OF LOAN COMMITMENTS (FOR EXAMPLE,

COMMERCIAL PAPER BACK-UP FACILITIES), LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS TO SPES, COMMITMENTS WITH RATING

TRIGGERS AND COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS.

GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE APPROVES THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND OVERSEES THE POLICYS

EXECUTION. TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING,

MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE. TREASURY FORMULATES THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY TARGETS AND STRATEGIES; MONITORS

THE FIRMS ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATIONS; MAINTAINS CONTINGENCY PLANNING,

INCLUDING RATINGS DOWNGRADE STRESS TESTING; AND

IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

LIQUIDITY WARNING SIGNALS TO PERMIT EARLY DETECTION

OF LIQUIDITY ISSUES.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

CONSISTENT WITH ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICY,

THE FIRM HAS RAISED FUNDS AT THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANY SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OBLIGATIONS AND

THOSE OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES THAT MATURE OVER

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

POSITION REMAINED STRONG BASED UPON ITS LIQUIDITY

METRICS. JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED FUNDING,

INCLUDING CORE LIABILITIES, EXCEEDED ILLIQUID

ASSETS, AND THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS OBLIGATIONS CAN

BE MET EVEN IF ACCESS TO FUNDING IS IMPAIRED.

THE DIVERSITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING SOURCES

ENHANCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS

DEPENDENCE ON ANY ONE SOURCE, THEREBY MINIMIZING

THE COST OF FUNDS. THE DEPOSITS HELD BY THE RFS,

CB, TSS AND AM LINES OF BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY A

STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE $639 BILLION. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS DEPOSITS

ARE RETAIL DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND

THEREFORE ARE CONSIDERED MORE STABLE THAN

MARKET-BASED (I.E., WHOLESALE) DEPOSITS. IN

ADDITION TO THESE DEPOSITS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY BALANCES ORIGINATED BY RFS,

CB, TSS AND AM THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. THESE FRANCHISE-GENERATED LIABILITY

BALANCES ARE ALSO A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

FUNDING DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FROM

WHICH THEY ARE GENERATED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF DEPOSIT AND LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS AND BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

ON PAGES 3652 AND 5556, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF

BOTH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK

NOTES, LONG-TERM DEBT, AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL

DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FUNDING IS MANAGED CENTRALLY,

USING REGIONAL EXPERTISE AND LOCAL MARKET ACCESS,

TO ENSURE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION BY THE FIRM IN THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WHILE MAINTAINING

CONSISTENT GLOBAL PRICING. THESE MARKETS SERVE AS A

COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCE OF FUNDS AND

ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT. DECISIONS CONCERNING THE TIMING AND

TENOR OF ACCESSING THESE MARKETS ARE BASED UPON

RELATIVE COSTS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS,

PROSPECTIVE VIEWS OF BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND A

TARGETED LIQUIDITY PROFILE.

FINALLY, FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE

FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE REPURCHASE AND ASSET

SECURITIZATION MARKETS. THESE MARKETS ARE EVALUATED

ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE

BALANCE OF SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING. THE

ABILITY TO SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED

GAINS ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY

DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND YIELDS OF THE

ASSETS SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY NOT DEPENDENT

UPON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE ISSUING ENTITY.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS

SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THESE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDE

RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS,

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE OFFBALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

ISSUANCE

CONTINUED STRONG FOREIGN INVESTOR PARTICIPATION IN

THE GLOBAL CORPORATE MARKETS ALLOWED JPMORGAN CHASE

TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES GLOBALLY TO

FURTHER DIVERSIFY ITS FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES.

DURING 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY

$56.7 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THESE ISSUANCES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY $34.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT

AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES THAT

MATURED OR WERE REDEEMED, AND BY THE FIRMS

REDEMPTION OF $139 MILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN

ADDITION, IN 2006 THE FIRM SECURITIZED

APPROXIMATELY $16.8 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

LOANS AND $9.7 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS,

RESULTING IN PRETAX GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $85

MILLION AND $67 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION OF

AUTOMOBILE LOANS RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT

GAIN. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 114118 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN OF ITS TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO REPLACEMENT

CAPITAL COVENANTS (RCCS) GRANTING CERTAIN RIGHTS TO THE

HOLDER OF COVERED DEBT, AS DEFINED IN THE RCCS, THAT

PROHIBIT THE REPAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR PURCHASE OF THE TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES EXCEPT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO THE EXTENT

THAT JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECEIVED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF PROCEEDS FROM

THE SALE OF CERTAIN QUALIFYING SECURITIES. CURRENTLY THE FIRMS

COVERED DEBT IS ITS 5.875% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST

DEBENTURES, SERIES O, DUE 2035. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING

THESE COVENANTS, SEE THE FORMS 8-K FILED BY THE FIRM ON

AUGUST 17, 2006, SEPTEMBER 28, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 2,

2007.

CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, NET

CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $49.6 BILLION

AND $30.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET CASH WAS USED

TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT LOANS ORIGINATED

OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL.

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS

DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS,

AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM

BORROWINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE FIRMS

OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

ORIGINATING LOANS TO BE HELD TO MATURITY, OTHER

RECEIVABLES, AND THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006,

NET CASH OF $99.6 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING

ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LOANS IN THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, MAINLY IN THE IB, REFLECTING

AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS

ORGANIC GROWTH IN CB. ON THE CONSUMER SIDE,

INCREASES IN CS LOANS REFLECTED STRONG ORGANIC

GROWTH, THE ACQUISITIONS OF PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT

CARD PORTFOLIOS AND THE 2006 FIRST-QUARTER ACQUISITION OF

COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND A DECLINE

IN AUTO LOANS AND LEASES. CASH ALSO WAS USED TO

FUND THE INCREASE IN THE TREASURY INVESTMENT

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH

REPOSITIONING OF THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, NET CASH OF

$12.9 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN CONSUMER LOANS,

PRIMARILY HOME EQUITY AND IN CS, REFLECTING GROWTH

IN NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS AND THE ACQUISITION OF

THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND A DECLINE

IN AUTO LOANS REFLECTING A DIFFICULT AUTO LENDING

MARKET. NET CASH WAS GENERATED BY THE TREASURY

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY FROM

MATURITIES OF SECURITIES, AS PURCHASES AND SALES OF

SECURITIES ESSENTIALLY OFFSET EACH OTHER.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT AND RECEIPT OF CUSTOMER

DEPOSITS. JPMORGAN CHASE PAYS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS

ON ITS COMMON STOCK AND HAS AN ONGOING STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN 2006, NET CASH PROVIDED BY

FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $152.7 BILLION DUE TO

GROWTH IN DEPOSITS, REFLECTING THE ONGOING

EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

AND HIGHER WHOLESALE BUSINESS VOLUMES; AND NET NEW

ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE

PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.

IN 2005, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES

WAS $45.1 BILLION DUE TO GROWTH IN DEPOSITS,

REFLECTING, ON THE RETAIL SIDE, NEW ACCOUNT

ACQUISITIONS AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF THE

BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, AND HIGHER WHOLESALE

BUSINESS VOLUMES; AND NET NEW ISSUANCES OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE PAYMENT OF CASH

DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASES PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SIGNIFICANT

SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. TO

A-1+. SIMILARLY, ON FEBRUARY 16, 2007, FITCH RAISED THE

SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND

OPERATING BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO AA-. FITCH ALSO RAISED THE

SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. TO F1+. THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED

FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. A

REDUCTION IN THESE RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

AFFECT ON THE FIRMS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES,

INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS

INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM,

STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES

AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

IF THE FIRMS RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH,

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF FUNDS

AND THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF FUNDING TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER

THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. IN

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM BELIEVES A

DOWNGRADE IS UNLIKELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT (FOR

EXAMPLE, THROUGH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

AND DERIVATIVES) TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES, FROM

LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER.

THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP OF

EACH CREDIT AND DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF ASSETS

THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE

COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. THE MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS WHOLESALE SYNDICATED LOAN ORIGINATIONS

(PRIMARILY TO IB CLIENTS) CONTINUES TO BE

DISTRIBUTED INTO THE MARKETPLACE, WITH RESIDUAL

HOLDS BY THE FIRM AVERAGING LESS THAN 10%.

WHOLESALE LOANS GENERATED BY CB AND AM ARE

GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. WITH

REGARD TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET, THE FIRM

FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED

FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE.

WITHIN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE

RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS WELL AS

SECURITIZED AND SOLD SELECTIVELY TO U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES;

THE LATTER CATEGORY OF LOANS IS ROUTINELY

CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF

RISK OFFICER. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY

FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT



ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE



MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS



MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING

AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURES

ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL

METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. LOSSES GENERATED

BY CONSUMER LOANS ARE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN

WHOLESALE LOSSES, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO CYCLICAL AND

SEASONAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF LOSS IS

HIGHER ON CONSUMER LOANS THAN ON WHOLESALE LOANS,

THE SEVERITY OF LOSS IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND MORE

MANAGEABLE ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE DIFFERENCES, METHODOLOGIES VARY DEPENDING ON

CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G.,

CONSUMER INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK

MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS

AND CREDIT BUREAU SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK

RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION

PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT

GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED UPON THE

AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT

AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED

UPON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS,

THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS.

PROBABLE LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, PRIMARILY ARE BASED UPON STATISTICAL

ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER TIME, ANTICIPATED

AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE

INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY

PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD BE

FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL AND

RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED

LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF

ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF

LOSSES. (REFER TO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

5759 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE CREDIT RISK CAPITAL METHODOLOGY.)

RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS

ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A RISK-

RATED BASIS; FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS

ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED, PROBABLE AND

UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED UPON

ESTIMATES OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN

DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE EXPECTED

DEFAULT CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS GIVEN

DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE BASED

UPON COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH

CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

BASED UPON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND

METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW.

RISK RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED AND REVIEWED ON AN

ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND

REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO REFLECT THE BORROWERS

CURRENT RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL

AND STRUCTURAL POSITIONS.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS

AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED UPON A STATISTICAL

ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS

OF TIME. PROBABLE LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING

SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING

AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS

AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION,

COMMON MEASURES OF CREDIT QUALITY DERIVED FROM

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO PREDICT

CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS

EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE

PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION SOURCES,

PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING

CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHARGE-OFF POLICIES.

THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT

PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO FORECAST DELINQUENCIES AND

SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

PROBABLE LOSSES. THESE FACTORS AND ANALYSES ARE

UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT

ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF DECISION-MAKING AND ENSURE CREDIT

RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY,

MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH

THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY

FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES,

CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES,

PORTFOLIO-REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR

MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURE. WHOLESALE CREDIT

RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER

BASIS. FOR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS

ITEMS ARE TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE

REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND

PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS

EXPECTATIONS AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. IN ORDER TO

MEET CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM

SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A RISK PROFILE THAT IS DIVERSE IN

TERMS OF BORROWER, PRODUCT TYPE, INDUSTRY AND

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION. ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN

SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER

RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND

DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT

METRIC FORECASTS, HOLD-LIMIT EXCEPTIONS AND RISK

PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO

REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE

APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT

EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED

WITH, THE OPERATING COMMITTEE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

2006 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO EXHIBITED CREDIT

STABILITY DURING 2006. THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH

IN WHOLESALE LENDING AS A RESULT OF INCREASED

CAPITAL MARKETSRELATED ACTIVITY, OFFSET BY

DECREASES IN NONPERFORMING LOANS AND CRITICIZED

EXPOSURE OF $601 MILLION AND $591 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN 2006, THE FIRM ALSO MADE

SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN ITS MULTIYEAR INITIATIVE TO

REENGINEER ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK SYSTEMS

INFRASTRUCTURE. SEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS WERE

INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRMS OPERATING

INFRASTRUCTURE IN 2006. OVERALL, THE INITIATIVE HAS

ENHANCED MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK; TIMELINESS AND

ACCURACY OF REPORTING; SUPPORT OF CLIENT

RELATIONSHIPS; ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL; AND

COMPLIANCE WITH BASEL II INITIATIVES. THE FIRM IS

ON TARGET TO SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE THE INITIATIVE

BY YEAR-END 2007.

CONSUMER CREDIT PERFORMANCE GENERALLY WAS STABLE IN

2006. CS ADOPTED THE FFIEC HIGHER MINIMUM PAYMENT

REQUIREMENTS, WHICH INITIALLY RESULTED IN HIGHER

PAYMENT RATES THAN HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED, ALBEIT

WITH LOSSES LESS SEVERE THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED.

LOANS IMPACTED BY HURRICANE KATRINA GENERALLY HAVE

PERFORMED BETTER THAN INITIALLY PROJECTED, BUT HAVE

EXPERIENCED LONGER RESOLUTION TIMEFRAMES,

ESPECIALLY WHERE REAL ESTATE AND BUSINESS BANKING

ASSETS ARE

INVOLVED. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED

TO HURRICANE KATRINA WAS REDUCED BY $121 MILLION IN

2006 AS A RESULT OF THE BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED

PERFORMANCE. BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION BECAME

EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 17, 2005. THIS LEGISLATION

PROMPTED A RUSH TO FILE EFFECT THAT RESULTED IN A

SPIKE IN BANKRUPTCY FILINGS AND INCREASED 2005

CREDIT LOSSES, PREDOMINANTLY IN CS. AS EXPECTED,

FOLLOWING THIS SPIKE IN FILINGS THE FIRM

EXPERIENCED LOWER CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFFS IN

2006, AS THE RECORD LEVELS OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE

INCLUDED BANKRUPTCY FILINGS THAT WOULD HAVE

OCCURRED IN 2006.

IN 2006, MANAGEMENT OF THE CONSUMER SEGMENT

CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON PORTFOLIOS PROVIDING THE MOST

APPROPRIATE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP WHILE KEEPING

WITHIN THE FIRMS DESIRED RISK TOLERANCE. DURING

THE PAST YEAR, THE MAJORITY OF THE NEW SUB-PRIME

MORTGAGE PRODUCTION WAS SOLD OR CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-FOR-SALE. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF THE

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO WAS TRANSFERRED INTO

THE HELD-FOR-SALE ACCOUNT. THE FIRM ALSO CONTINUED A DE-EMPHASIS OF VEHICLE

FINANCE LEASING. THE FIRM EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN

MANY CORE CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS INCLUDING HOME

EQUITY, CREDIT CARDS, EDUCATION, AND BUSINESS

BANKING REFLECTING A FOCUS ON THE PRIME CREDIT

QUALITY SEGMENT OF THE MARKET.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

WHOLESALE SELECTED INDUSTRY DISCUSSION

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL

INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT

EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIES THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR

POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE

PRECEDING PAGE.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES: THIS INDUSTRY GROUP, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EXPOSURE

TO COMMERCIAL BANKS, IS THE LARGEST

SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. CREDIT QUALITY IS HIGH, AS 84% OF THE

EXPOSURE IN THIS CATEGORY IS RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE.



REAL ESTATE: THIS INDUSTRY, AS THE SECOND LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

CREDIT PORTFOLIO, CONTINUED TO GROW IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVING MARKET

FUNDAMENTALS AND INCREASED CAPITAL DEMAND FOR THE ASSET CLASS SUPPORTED BY THE RELATIVELY

LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED BY CLIENT,

TRANSACTION TYPE, GEOGRAPHY, AND PROPERTY TYPE. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS EXPOSURE IS TO

LARGE PUBLIC AND RATED REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AND INSTITUTIONS (E.G., REITS), AS WELL AS

REAL ESTATE LOANS ORIGINATED FOR SALE INTO THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

MARKET. THE REMAINING EXPOSURE IS PRIMARILY TO PROFESSIONAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS,

OWNERS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND GENERALLY INVOLVES REAL ESTATE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY

TENANTS.



AUTOMOTIVE: AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS BASED IN NORTH

AMERICA CONTINUED TO BE IMPACTED NEGATIVELY BY A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN

2006. AS A RESULT, CRITICIZED EXPOSURES GREW IN 2006, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES

TO SELECT NAMES WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. THOUGH LARGER IN THE AGGREGATE, MOST OF THE

CRITICIZED EXPOSURE REMAINED UNDRAWN, WAS PERFORMING AND SUBSTANTIALLY SECURED.



MEDIA: MEDIA NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURE

SINCE ITS CRITICIZED EXPOSURES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2006. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MATURATION OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,

REPAYMENTS, AND THE PLANNED SALE TO REDUCE SELECT EXPOSURES.



ALL OTHER: ALL OTHER IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION TABLE ON PAGE 68

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, EXCLUDING HFS,

INCLUDED $317.5 BILLION OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO 22 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED TO SPES AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WERE 31% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THIS CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING (GENERALLY BACKED BY RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR

BONDS ON A BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE, NON- RECOURSE OR LIMITED-RECOURSE BASIS) ORIGINATED BY A

DIVERSE GROUP OF COMPANIES IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT HIGHLY CORRELATED. THE REMAINING ALL

OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRIES OTHER THAN THOSE RELATED TO SPES AND

HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS; NONE COMPRISE MORE THAN 3% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS; TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH TRADING

ACTIVITIES; TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS; AND

TO MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, SEE NOTE 28 ON

PAGES 131132 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONTRACTS, EXCLUDING WRITTEN OPTIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SPOT CONTRACTS.

(C)

2005 HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT MORE APPROPRIATE PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION OF

CERTAIN BALANCES.

THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS OF $56 BILLION AND $50 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, IS THE AMOUNT OF THE

MARK-TO-MARKET (MTM) OR FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING

AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AND REPRESENTS THE

COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES

SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW,

THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK SHOULD ALSO REFLECT

ADDITIONAL LIQUID SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL BY THE FIRM OF

$7 BILLION AND $6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN TOTAL EXPOSURE, NET OF ALL

COLLATERAL, OF $49 BILLION AND $44 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE

INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, BUT THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE

CREDIT RISK OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THIS

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL SECURES POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE IN

THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS

TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, THE FIRM HELD $12 BILLION AND $10 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. THE DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE OTHER

CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY

RECEIVABLES.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE,

THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY

OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM

CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT

LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE) AND

AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL

INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME

MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL

FUTURE CREDIT RISK EMBEDDED IN THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL

PEAK CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE, AT THE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL, CREDIT RISK IS REDUCED BY THE FACT

THAT WHEN OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH

SEPARATE COUNTER-PARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO

TRADES CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS, EVEN IF BOTH

COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE

FIRM REFERS TO THIS EFFECT AS MARKET

DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK

(MDP) MEASURE IS A PORTFOLIO AGGREGATION OF

COUNTERPARTY PEAK MEASURES, REPRESENTING THE

MAXIMUM LOSSES AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT

WOULD OCCUR IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULTED UNDER

ANY ONE GIVEN MARKET SCENARIO AND TIME FRAME.

DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT EXPOSURE IS A

MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISKINESS OF DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO

THE RISKINESS OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS

DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE

CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE

UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF

POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY

MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF

THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE

BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL

LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE

PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING

PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL

AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AVERAGE EXPOSURE WAS $36

BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF

ALL COLLATERAL, OF $49 BILLION AND $44 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GRAPH BELOW SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO

DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED

BY THE MDP, DRE AND AVG METRICS. ALL THREE

MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER

THE FIRST YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE

PORTFOLIO.

EXPOSURE PROFILE OF DERIVATIVES MEASURES

70

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE

CVA IS BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY

AND THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF

CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL

ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING

MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE

RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE

DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY

ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE INCREASE IN AAA TO AA- WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO EXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN

DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS DECREASED SLIGHTLY, TO 80% AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, FROM 81% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE FIRM POSTED $27 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF

BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT

REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON

SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CREDIT

RATINGS, TO POST COLLATERAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

OTHER PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE IMPACT OF

A SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A., FROM ITS RATING OF AA- TO A+ AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $1.1 BILLION

OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM;

THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE (FROM

AA- TO BBB-) WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $3.1 BILLION OF

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR

TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A

DOWNGRADE OF EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY,

AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVES; THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT REDUCE THE

REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR

THE LEVEL OF REPORTED OFFBALANCE SHEET

COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO DIVERSIFIES EXPOSURES BY

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

71

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS LIMITED COUNTERPARTY

EXPOSURE AS A RESULT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

TRANSACTIONS. OF THE $55.6 BILLION OF TOTAL

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

APPROXIMATELY $5.7 BILLION, OR 10%, WAS ASSOCIATED

WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE BENEFIT OF

LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL.

DEALER/CLIENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS INCREASED $2.4 TRILLION FROM

YEAR-END 2005 AS A RESULT OF INCREASED TRADE VOLUME

IN THE MARKET. THIS BUSINESS HAS A MISMATCH BETWEEN

THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF PROTECTION PURCHASED

AND SOLD. HOWEVER, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE RISK

POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED WHEN SECURITIES USED

TO RISK-MANAGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE

TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

ARE ADJUSTED TO A DURATION-BASED EQUIVALENT BASIS

OR TO REFLECT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUBORDINATION IN

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE

QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 133, AND

THEREFORE, EFFECTIVENESS TESTING UNDER SFAS 133 IS

NOT PERFORMED. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS. THE MTM VALUE INCORPORATES

BOTH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PREMIUMS AND

CHANGES IN VALUE DUE TO MOVEMENT IN SPREADS AND

CREDIT EVENTS; IN CONTRAST, THE LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BEING RISK-MANAGED ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOAN INTEREST

AND FEES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN NET INTEREST

INCOME, AND IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THIS ASYMMETRY IN

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, BETWEEN LOANS AND

$4.0 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION OF LOANS AND

COMMITMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, RECOGNIZING GAINS

(LOSSES) OF $73 MILLION, $76 MILLION AND ($8)

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITY, SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND NOTE 14

ON PAGES 6263 AND 114118, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $391.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, COMPARED WITH $321.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. SEE PAGE 66 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE INCREASE IN

EXPOSURE. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL

AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE

FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE

BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE

INSTRUMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A

LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS

AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED

COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS

EXPECTED, BASED UPON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF A

DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT

OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $212

BILLION AND $178 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

EMERGING

MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE

INTERNAL PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING EXPOSURES AND RISK IN

EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES  DEFINED AS THOSE COUNTRIES

POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO SOVEREIGN EVENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, BASED UPON ITS INTERNAL METHODOLOGY,

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL EMERGING-MARKETS COUNTRY WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT, IN THAT TOTAL EXPOSURE TO ANY SUCH COUNTRY DID NOT

EXCEED 0.75% OF THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS. IN EVALUATING AND

MANAGING ITS EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES, THE FIRM TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING, AND

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED.

EXPOSURE AMOUNTS ARE THEN ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G.,

GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES LOCATED

OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, IF THE ENHANCEMENTS FULLY COVER THE COUNTRY RISK

AS WELL AS THE CREDIT RISK. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

FIRMS CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE, BASED UPON GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (FFIEC),

SEE PART 1, ITEM 1,

LOAN PORTFOLIO, CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS, ON PAGE 155, OF THE

FIRMS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS

PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY

LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES,

EDUCATION LOANS AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND

REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF DIVERSIFICATION FROM BOTH A

PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. THE PRIMARY

FOCUS IS SERVING THE PRIME CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET.

THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS IN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

THAT RESULT IN

NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION. HOWEVER, RFS OFFERS HOME

EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT AND MORTGAGE LOANS WITH

INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT OPTIONS TO PREDOMINANTLY

PRIME BORROWERS. THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS

CONSUMER CREDIT OPERATION. ONGOING EFFORTS INCLUDE

CONTINUAL REVIEW AND ENHANCEMENT OF CREDIT

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005 REFLECTING GROWTH IN MOST

CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS INCREASED BY 14%, TO $747.5 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN

CREDIT CARDS AND HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN

AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES WITHIN THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES.

AVERAGE RFS LOAN BALANCES FOR 2006 WERE $203.9

BILLION. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR RETAIL LOANS

IN 2006 WAS 0.31%, WHICH WAS FLAT COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING STABLE CREDIT TRENDS IN

MOST CONSUMER LENDING PORTFOLIOS. NEW LOANS

ORIGINATED IN 2006 PRIMARILY REFLECT HIGH CREDIT

QUALITY CONSISTENT

WITH MANAGEMENTS FOCUS ON PRIME AND NEAR-PRIME

CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTATION. THE FIRM REGULARLY

EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE OVERALL

ECONOMIC RETURNS OF NEW ORIGINATIONS AND MAKES AN

INITIAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TO CLASSIFY

SPECIFIC NEW ORIGINATIONS AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT OR

HELD-FOR-SALE. THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY EVALUATES

THE OVERALL ECONOMIC RETURNS OF ITS

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT LOAN PORTFOLIO UNDER PREVAILING

MARKET CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO RETAIN OR

SELL LOANS IN THE PORTFOLIO. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED

THAT A LOAN THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT WILL BE SOLD IT IS TRANSFERRED

INTO A HELD-FOR-SALE ACCOUNT. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS

ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE,

WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE.

HOME EQUITY.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, WERE $85.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $11.9

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2005. GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO

REFLECTED ORGANIC GROWTH, AS WELL AS THE BANK OF

NEW YORK TRANSACTION. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

WERE $59.7 BILLION. MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $709

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM

PROVIDES MORTGAGE LOANS

TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CREDIT BORROWERS, MORE

THAN 75% OF RFS MORTGAGE LOANS ON THE BALANCE

SHEET ARE TO PRIME BORROWERS. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM SELLS OR SECURITIZES VIRTUALLY ALL FIXED-RATE

MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS, AS WELL AS A PORTION OF ITS

ADJUSTABLE RATE ORIGINATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE

PORTFOLIO OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF

ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. THE GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED AS SHOWN IN THE

AUTO LOANS AND LEASES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

AUTO LOANS AND LEASES DECREASED TO $41.0 BILLION

FROM $46.1 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005. THE DECREASE

IN OUTSTANDING LOANS WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE

DE-EMPHASIS OF VEHICLE FINANCE LEASING, WHICH

COMPRISED $1.7 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING LOANS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, DOWN FROM $4.3 BILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTS A HIGH

CONCENTRATION OF PRIME AND NEAR-PRIME QUALITY

CREDITS.

ALL OTHER LOANS.

ALL OTHER LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS (WHICH ARE HIGHLY

COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN

GUARANTEES), EDUCATION LOANS AND COMMUNITY

DEVELOPMENT LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OTHER

LOANS INCREASED TO $27.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH

$18.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005. THIS INCREASE IS

DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN EDUCATION LOANS AS

A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING

SERVICES. LOAN BALANCES ALSO INCREASED IN BUSINESS

BANKING PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE BANK OF NEW

YORK TRANSACTION.

CARD SERVICES

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO

ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND

THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS THROUGH

SECURITIZATION. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

WERE $152.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AN

INCREASE OF $10.6 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2005,

REFLECTING ORGANIC GROWTH AND ACQUISITIONS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CUSTOMER PAYMENT RATES.

THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

DECREASED TO 3.33% FOR 2006, FROM 5.21% IN 2005.

THIS DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER

BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE 30-DAY

DELINQUENCY RATES INCREASED TO 3.13% AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, FROM 2.79% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACCELERATED LOSS RECOGNITION OF

DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS IN 2005, AS A RESULT OF THE

2005 BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION. THE MANAGED

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A

WELL-SEASONED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S.

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING

LOSSES WHERE THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN

FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE

CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM, AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK

POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. THE ALLOWANCE IS REVIEWED

RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND IS

ADJUSTED IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE

WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

COM-

PONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, THE LATTER OF

WHICH CONSISTS OF A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGE 83

AND NOTE 13 ON PAGES 113114 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE

(I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT

ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR FOR WHICH THE

SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY

DETERMINED).

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

75

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED BY

$313 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005, PRIMARILY DUE

TO ACTIVITY IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. NEW LENDING

ACTIVITY IN IB AND CB WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER

WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING LOANS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE

WAS A RELEASE OF $157 MILLION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA IN THE CONSUMER

AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS.

EXCLUDING HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTED 1.70% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, COMPARED WITH 1.84% AT DECEMBER 31,

2005. THE WHOLESALE COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE

INCREASED TO $2.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

FROM $2.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005, DUE TO LOAN

GROWTH IN THE IB AND CB, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION

OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE

CONSUMER ALLOWANCE DECREASED $69 MILLION, WHICH

INCLUDED A RELEASE OF $98 MILLION IN CS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $29 MILLION BUILD IN RFS. THE ALLOWANCE RELEASE BY

CS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

RELEASING THE REMAINING ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS

RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA ESTABLISHED IN

2005. EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE RELEASE FOR

HURRICANE KATRINA, CS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

REMAINED CONSTANT AS IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY

OFFSET THE INCREASE OF $14.1 BILLION IN LOAN

RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO THE ALLOWANCE. THE RFS

BUILD WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOANS ACQUIRED

IN THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE

FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT, MANAGEMENT ALSO

COMPUTES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT FOR WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE COMPONENTS ARE

COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED

FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR

EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

THIS ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES, WAS $524 MILLION AND $400 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE REFLECTED INCREASED LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AND UPDATES TO INPUTS USED IN THE

CALCULATION.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE REPORTED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE PAGE 29 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDES CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOSSES WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR-YEAR

PERIODS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED CHARGE-OFFS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD OUTSTANDINGS WERE $3.6 BILLION LOWER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR END.

PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY

MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND TO REFINE AND

MONITOR MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALL

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPREHENSIVE

IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF MARKET RISKS

WITHIN THEIR UNITS. RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES HAVE

FUNCTIONS THAT ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM TRADING

PERSONNEL AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK

EXPOSURES THAT THE BUSINESS TAKES. IN ADDITION TO

PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT FOR MARKET RISK

ARISING FROM THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING

EXPOSURES WHICH MAY NOT BE LARGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BUT WHICH MAY BE LARGE FOR THE

FIRM IN AGGREGATE. REGULAR MEETINGS ARE HELD

BETWEEN MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE HEADS OF

RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE ON

RISK EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT FLOWS.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK CAN

BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRADING AND

NONTRADING RISK. TRADING RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS

THAT ARE HELD BY THE FIRM AS PART OF A BUSINESS

SEGMENT OR UNIT WHOSE MAIN BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO

TRADE OR MAKE MARKETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED IN

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK

INCLUDES SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS HELD FOR

LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS,

AND SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE

FIRMS ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT

REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

TRADING RISK

FIXED INCOME RISK (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST RATE

RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK), FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES AND OTHER TRADING RISKS

INVOLVE THE POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN

MARKET RATES, WHETHER ARISING FROM CLIENT

ACTIVITIES OR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE

FIRM.

NONTRADING RISK

NONTRADING RISK ARISES FROM EXECUTION OF THE

FIRMS CORE BUSINESS

STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS

THE FIRM UNDERTAKES TO RISK-MANAGE EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG

THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES

AND OFFBALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL AND SHAPE OF MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES ALSO

MAY CREATE INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE REPRICING

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT

NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THE

FIRM ALSO IS EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK, WHICH IS THE

DIFFERENCE IN REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO

FLOATING-RATE INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND

3-MONTH LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE FIRMS

PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT IMPACT

PRICING AND BALANCES.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES ALSO GIVE

RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE INTEREST

RATE EXPOSURE FROM THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING

ACTIVITIES IS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF

INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS OPTION AND BASIS RISK.

OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT

OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE

PROBABILITY OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE

COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS

FROM DIFFERENT RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN MORTGAGE

RATES AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL

ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS

METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL,

INCLUDING.



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)



LOSS ADVISORIES



ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING



EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS

TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT

VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, MARKET VALUES,

POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER.

THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE

FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY

LINE OF BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR

MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND TACTICAL

CONTROL.

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE,

VAR, ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE

MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND

PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF

RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS

USED FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES,

MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS, AND AS AN

INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. VAR

PROVIDES RISK TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING

ENVIRONMENT. EACH BUSINESS DAY THE FIRM UNDERTAKES

A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES BOTH

ITS TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING RISKS. VAR FOR

NONTRADING RISK MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL

CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE EXPOSURES RELATED

TO THESE RISKS; HOWEVER, FOR SUCH RISKS, VAR IS NOT

A MEASURE OF REPORTED REVENUE SINCE NONTRADING

ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MARKED TO MARKET

THROUGH EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL

SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS

AND PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE WAY.

THIS APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN

MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES.

THE SIMULATION IS BASED UPON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS

TWELVE

MONTHS. THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR USING A ONE-DAY

TIME HORIZON AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY,

WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS

MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES GREATER

THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN

EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS, OR ABOUT TWO TO THREE TIMES

A YEAR.

AND THE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, SEE PAGES 5354 AND NOTE 16 ON PAGES 121122 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT, RESPECTIVELY. TRADING VAR INCLUDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING ACTIVITIES IN IB;

HOWEVER, PARTICULAR RISK PARAMETERS OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE NOT FULLY CAPTURED, FOR

EXAMPLE, CORRELATION RISK.

(B)

INCLUDES VAR ON DERIVATIVE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, HEDGES OF THE CREDIT

VALUATION ADJUSTMENT AND MARK-TO-MARKET HEDGES OF THE ACCRUAL LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH ARE

ALL REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANS- ACTIONS REVENUE. THIS VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ACCRUAL

LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS NOT MARKED TO MARKET.

(C)

AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END VARS ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF ITS MARKET RISK

COMPONENTS, WHICH IS DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE

DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE RISKS ARE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED. THE

RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE RISKS OF

THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES.

(D)

DESIGNATED AS NOT MEANINGFUL (NM) BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON

DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DIFFERENT RISK COMPONENTS, AND HENCE IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A

PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT.

INVESTMENT BANKS AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND

CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR WAS $88 MILLION FOR BOTH 2006

AND 2005. COMMODITIES AND OTHER VAR INCREASED DUE

TO CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE ENERGY TRADING

BUSINESS, WHILE FIXED INCOME VAR DECREASED DUE TO

REDUCED RISK POSITIONS, AS WELL AS TO LOWER MARKET

VOLATILITY COMPARED WITH 2005. THESE CHANGES ALSO

LED TO AN INCREASE IN PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION, AS

AVERAGE TRADING VAR DIVERSIFICATION INCREASED TO

$70 MILLION, OR 45% OF THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS,

DURING 2006; FROM $59 MILLION, OR 41% OF THE SUM OF

THE COMPONENTS, DURING 2005. IN GENERAL, OVER THE

COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET

VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

CHANGE.

VAR BACK-TESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE

FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST

DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS

DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE LESS PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS/LOSSES PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST

INCOME, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR

OTHER REVENUE. THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES

THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR

IB TRADING BUSINESSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2006. THE CHART SHOWS THAT IB POSTED MARKET

RISK-RELATED GAINS ON 227 OUT OF 260 DAYS IN THIS

PERIOD, WITH 29 DAYS EXCEEDING $100 MILLION. THE

INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH IB

EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS.

LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 33 DAYS, WITH NO LOSS

GREATER THAN $100 MILLION, AND WITH NO LOSS

EXCEEDING THE VAR MEASURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

LOSS ADVISORIES

LOSS ADVISORIES ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TO

SENIOR MANAGEMENT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN

LEVELS AND ARE USED TO INITIATE DISCUSSION OF

REMEDIES.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE

CHANGES IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING CAPTURES

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE

EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS FOR BOTH ITS TRADING

AND ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH

USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME CREDIT SPREADS

WIDEN SIGNIFICANTLY, EQUITY PRICES DECLINE AND

INTEREST RATES RISE IN THE MAJOR CURRENCIES.

ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS PREDOMINANT

IN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND INCLUDE

SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE

MOVES IN COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS. PERIODICALLY,

SCENARIOS ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND ECONOMIC

EVENTS. ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT

IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING

ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK

PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AND STRESS LOSSES ARE

MONITORED AGAINST LIMITS. STRESS TESTING IS ALSO

UTILIZED IN ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND CROSS-BUSINESS

RISK MEASUREMENT, AS WELL AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC

CAPITAL ALLOCATION. STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND

EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED EACH MONTH TO THE FIRMS

SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO

HELP THEM BETTER MEASURE AND MANAGE RISKS AND TO

UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE

ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE

FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN MARKET

VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON

REPORTED NET INCOME ALSO IS CRITICAL. INTEREST RATE

RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE NONTRADING

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON AND

OFFBALANCE SHEET POSITIONS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS

SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NII FROM ITS NONTRADING

ACTIVITIES UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE

SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE

POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO

VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS THE RATES

THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING

STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN

PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE

SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES AND

SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND

REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK ALSO CAN RESULT FROM CHANGES IN

THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS

THE ABILITY TO LEND AT FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT

VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED UPON

THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE

AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED

INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES WITHOUT A

CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES.

CONVERSELY, HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES GENERALLY ARE

BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

INCREASE IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM

RATES.

INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF

JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS-AT-RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE

THE PRIMARY CHANGE IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2005, REFLECTS A HIGHER LEVEL OF AFS

SECURITIES AND OTHER REPOSITIONING. THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED TO BOTH RISING AND FALLING RATES. THE

FIRMS RISK TO RISING RATES IS LARGELY THE RESULT

OF INCREASED FUNDING COSTS. IN CONTRAST, THE

EXPOSURE TO FALLING RATES IS THE RESULT OF HIGHER

ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF LOAN AND SECURITIES

PREPAYMENTS.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY

THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM

SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL TAX

CHANGE, AND ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITIES OF LOSSES

ARISING FROM SUCH EVENTS. THIS INFORMATION IS

ENTERED INTO THE FIRMS RIFLE DATABASE. TRADING

MANAGEMENT HAS ACCESS TO RIFLE, THEREBY PERMITTING

THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY

NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A

SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK

APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT

AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET

VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRENDS AND

MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND

UPDATES RISK LIMITS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING

THE FIRMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING

RISK LIMITS AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT FURTHER CONTROLS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE BY

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATING APPROVED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND TENORS, KNOWN AS INSTRUMENT

AUTHORITIES, FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS.

CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS.

SIMILARLY, LINE-OF-BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND

STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LOSS

ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND

INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST WHICH

EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED. LIMIT

BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS SEGMENT IS

REQUIRED EITHER TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS OR

CONSULT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATE

ACTION.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ALSO PERFORMS

PERIODIC REVIEWS AS NECESSARY OF BOTH BUSINESSES

AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK IN ORDER

TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL

THEIR MARKET RISK. STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS,

PRODUCT DETAILS AND RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED, AND

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE

TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE

VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE

INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS

ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION.

THE MODEL RISK GROUP, INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES

AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE

FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND

CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF

FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION

AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT,

INCLUDING WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND ITS

SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SUITABILITY AND CONVERGENCE

PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF

DATA SOURCES, CONSISTENCY OF THE TREATMENT WITH

MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO

INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE

PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED OF NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS

WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS

WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT

OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY AND

WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE

DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS

BASED UPON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 8385 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

NONSTATISTICAL EXPOSURES, VALUE-AT-RISK, LOSS

ADVISORIES AND LIMIT EXCESSES ARE REPORTED DAILY

FOR EACH TRADING AND NONTRADING BUSINESS. MARKET

RISK EXPOSURE TRENDS, VALUE-AT-RISK TRENDS, PROFIT

AND LOSS CHANGES, AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS ARE

REPORTED WEEKLY. STRESS-TEST RESULTS ARE REPORTED

MONTHLY TO BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAKES DIRECT PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM

HOLDING PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS

DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK OF

POSITIONS

HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS APPROACH

TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS CONSISTENT WITH

THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING TARGET LEVELS

FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO CONTROL

THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO. INDUSTRY AND

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND

INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE

PORTFOLIO; AND PERIODIC REVIEWS

ARE PERFORMED ON THE PORTFOLIO TO SUBSTANTIATE

THE VALUATIONS OF THE INVESTMENTS. THE VALUATION

FUNCTION WITHIN MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT THAT REPORTS

INTO FINANCE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE

ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESSES WAS $6.1 BILLION, OF WHICH $587 MILLION

REPRESENTED POSITIONS TRADED IN THE PUBLIC MARKET.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM

INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN

FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK

CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING

ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS,

INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES OR VENDORS THAT

DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTSOURCING

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN

FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM

MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND A

CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND

WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL

IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS,

IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN

WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES

TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS AND

DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY

APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY

ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED

BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL

RISK SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED

TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK

IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING

AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER,

THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS

MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING,

REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES MAY GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

ALL BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE FIRMS NEWLY REDESIGNED

FIRMWIDE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND SUPPORTING

ARCHITECTURE AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE

GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS FOR EACH

BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS

SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE DEGREE

TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION

PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES IDENTIFIED,

AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING

AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL

RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS AND

LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED

BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK-EVENT

TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN

BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE

ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED

ENABLES THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST AGAINST

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE FIRM IS A FOUNDING

MEMBER OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK DATA EXCHANGE, A

NOT-FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FORMED FOR THE

PURPOSE OF COLLECTING OPERATIONAL LOSS DATA AND

SHARING DATA IN AN ANONYMOUS FORM AND BENCHMARKING

RESULTS BACK TO MEMBERS. SUCH INFORMATION

SUPPLEMENTS THE FIRMS ONGOING OPERATIONAL RISK

ANALYSIS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY

AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION

ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS

AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS

IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL

RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE

CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF

AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS

OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

AND REPORTING. AUDIT PARTNERS WITH BUSINESS

MANAGEMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE CONTROL COMMUNITY IN

PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THE OPERATIONAL RISK

FRAMEWORK AND REVIEWING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF THE

BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS UNIT AUDITS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS

PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET

AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS

BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE

AMONG MANY CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS,

REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A

REPUTATION FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST

QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION ALWAYS HAS BEEN A

KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE

OF REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE AT

THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL

RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE

FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, MAINTAINING

ADHERENCE TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND OVERSIGHT

FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE

OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE,

WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE

POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE

FIRM, AND A POLICY REVIEW OFFICE THAT REVIEWS

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY

COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED FINANCE

TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT

ADVERSELY THE FIRMS REPUTATION.

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE IS THE MOST SENIOR

APPROVAL LEVEL FOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

REPUTATION RISK ISSUES. THE MANDATE OF THE POLICY

REVIEW OFFICE IS TO OPINE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS

BROUGHT BY THE REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK REVIEW

COMMITTEES AND CONSIDER CHANGES IN POLICIES OR

PRACTICES RELATING TO REPUTATION RISK. THE HEAD OF

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE CONSULTS WITH THE FIRMS

MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AND

PROVIDES REGULAR UPDATES. THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

REINFORCES THE FIRMS PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING

TRANSACTIONS IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL

ISSUES AND REPUTATION RISK. IT FOCUSES ON THE

PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE

CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR

OTHERS.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS

REPUTATION RISK LIES WITH THE BUSINESS UNITS

CONDUCTING THE TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION. THE FIRMS

TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES REVIEW FROM,

AMONG OTHERS, INTERNAL LEGAL/COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS,

TAX AND ACCOUNTING GROUPS. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

AN SPE ESTABLISHED BY THE FIRM RECEIVE PARTICULAR

SCRUTINY INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SUCH ENTITY

IS PROPERLY APPROVED, DOCUMENTED, MONITORED AND

CONTROLLED.

BUSINESS UNITS ALSO ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO

REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK REVIEW COMMITTEES PROPOSED

TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO HEIGHTENED

REPUTATION RISK. THE COMMITTEES MAY APPROVE, REJECT

OR REQUIRE FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON OR CHANGES TO

THE TRANSACTIONS. THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES

ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS AND

SUPPORT UNITS IN THE REGION. THE COMMITTEES MAY

ESCALATE TRANSACTION REVIEW TO THE POLICY REVIEW

OFFICE.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS INCLUDE IN THEIR MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT OF

THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE,

FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES THAT MAY

PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS WITH

THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES WITH

THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING

INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS

PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO

THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF

PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES

THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A

CLIENT, INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION,

DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY

THE FIRM, THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES.

IN THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE

FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE

RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF

THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE

TO SUCH DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY

OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FIRMS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

PLANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF

ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS

REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT

TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUATION OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED

POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE

THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS

MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED,

INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY

FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN

APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES

FOR DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF ITS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION

JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS

THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS WELL

AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF

THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES

AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN

ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 113114 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY

IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING.

SECOND, IT INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN ESTABLISHING THE

INPUTS USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCES. THIRD, IT

INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO EVALUATE CERTAIN

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND

OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT

PORTFOLIO AND TO REFINE LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER

REFLECT THESE CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS. WHOLESALE

LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE

OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN

ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN,

AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGORS DEBT

CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF

THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR

REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES,

MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY

IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE

BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT

INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND

INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER

OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD IMPACT THE

RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS

FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES.

WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT,

VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE

ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF

LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT,

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO WHETHER THE LOSS

ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER

THE ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN

THE CREDIT CYCLE, AS WELL AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA

SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED.

CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS

SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO

AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT

INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE

LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC

EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED

IN THE LOSS FACTORS. THE RESULTANT ADJUSTMENTS TO

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ON THE PERFORMING

PORTFOLIO ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED

RANGES USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS

GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS

RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING

INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT.

THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON

MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO

CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS,

QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER

RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO. THE

ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO FOR THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS $903 MILLION BASED UPON

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

CONSUMER LOANS

FOR SCORED LOANS IN THE CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS,

LOSS IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY APPLYING

STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS

TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. THESE LOSS

ESTIMATES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY

STATUS, CREDIT BUREAU SCORES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE

OF COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL

LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT.

MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE RANGE OF CREDIT LOSS

EXPERIENCED FOR EACH MAJOR PORTFOLIO SEGMENT,

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC CYCLES, PORTFOLIO

SEASONING AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, AND THEN

FORMULATES A RANGE THAT INCORPORATES RELEVANT RISK

FACTORS THAT IMPACT OVERALL CREDIT PERFORMANCE. THE

RECORDED ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION

FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS $1.2

BILLION BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AFS SECURITIES,

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MORTGAGE SERVICING

RIGHTS (MSRS). HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND PHYSICAL

COMMODITIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF FAIR VALUE

OR COST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $526.8

BILLION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS DEFINED

AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING

PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR

UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT UTILIZE

INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING

INTEREST RATE YIELD CURVES, OPTION VOLATILITIES AND

CURRENCY RATES.

THE DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF

QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR OBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS. FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE

TRADED ACTIVELY AND HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR

PARAMETERS READILY AVAILABLE, THERE IS LITTLE-TO-NO

SUBJECTIVITY IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. WHEN

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND PARAMETERS DO NOT

EXIST, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE

FAIR VALUE. THE VALUATION PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

83

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION

CONCERNS AND, FOR THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO,

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (FOR A DISCUSSION OF CVA, SEE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS

ON PAGES 6972 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). FOR EXAMPLE,

THERE IS OFTEN LIMITED MARKET DATA TO RELY ON WHEN

ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF A LARGE OR AGED

POSITION. SIMILARLY, JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED IN

ESTIMATING PRICES FOR LESS READILY OBSERVABLE

EXTERNAL PARAMETERS. FINALLY, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, MARKET DISLOCATIONS AND

UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF

FAIR VALUE. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS

CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS RECORDED

FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION.

TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES HELD FOR

TRADING AND INVESTMENT PURPOSES (LONG POSITIONS)

AND SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER

PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE

VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN SECURITIES ARE TRADED LESS ACTIVELY AND,

THEREFORE, ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO BE VALUED BASED

UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE DETERMINATION OF

THEIR FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AS

THIS DETERMINATION MAY REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND

RECOVERY RATES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CERTAIN

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND

HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES.

AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN

EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE

ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL

SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-PRICING SERVICES.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVES, HOWEVER, ARE VALUED BASED UPON

MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE

ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT TO SUBSTANTIATE THE MODEL VALUATION. THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER TRADED LESS

ACTIVELY OR TRADE ACTIVITY IS ONE WAY. EXAMPLES

INCLUDE LONG-DATED INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY SWAPS,

WHERE SWAP RATES MAY BE UNOBSERVABLE FOR LONGER

MATURITIES, AND CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHERE

CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE UNOBSERVABLE.

DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THE FIRM

DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS

RECOGNIZED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE ON A

SYSTEMATIC BASIS (TYPICALLY STRAIGHT-LINE

AMORTIZATION OVER THE LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS) WHEN

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE.

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT INCLUDES RECORDING FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENTS (I.E., REDUCTIONS) TO MODEL VALUATIONS

TO ACCOUNT FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY WHEN VALUING

COMPLEX OR LESS ACTIVELY TRADED DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE

PRIOR TO NETTING POSITIONS PURSUANT TO FIN 39, AS CROSS-PRODUCT NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO

AN ANALYSIS BASED UPON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

TO ENSURE THAT THE VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE,

THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS CONTROLS IN PLACE. THESE

INCLUDE: AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF

VALUATION MODELS; DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION

FOR PROFIT AND LOSS ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME;

DECOMPOSING THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN

STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR

COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND VALIDATING

VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT.

AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE

TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE MODEL REVIEW PROCESS, SEE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7780 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE FIRMS VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES 135137 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE

PORTFOLIO GENERALLY IS BASED UPON OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED

CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK THAT IS

DISCOUNTED USING AN INTEREST RATE APPROPRIATE FOR

THE MATURITY OF THE APPLICABLE LOANS.

COMMODITIES INVENTORY

THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY INCLUDES

BULLION AND BASE METALS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO PRICES IN HIGHLY ACTIVE

AND LIQUID MARKETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING

PRICES AND DATA DERIVED FROM THE MARKETS ON WHICH

THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. MARKET

PRICES USED MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR LIQUIDITY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

VALUATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD PRIMARILY BY

THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE

ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK OF

LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED INITIALLY

BASED UPON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO

REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES

EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY

CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS

ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY

PRIVATE EQUITYS SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A

VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO

ASSESS IMPAIRMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF

THE PARTICULAR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT, INDUSTRY

VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES

IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

ENVIRONMENT OVER TIME.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE

NOTE 4 ON PAGES 9899 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS FROM

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT TRADE IN AN

ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES.

FOR EXAMPLE, SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, BUT THE

PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICALLY ARE NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING DISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOW (DCF) MODELS.

FOR MSRS, THE FIRM USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD

(OAS) VALUATION MODEL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO PROJECT MSR

CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS,

WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES TO

ESTIMATE AN EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE

OAS MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,

CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER

ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS.

FOR CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATIONS (SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS), A

SINGLE INTEREST RATE PATH DCF MODEL IS USED AND

GENERALLY INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON

PROJECTED FINANCE CHARGES RELATED TO THE

SECURITIZED ASSETS, ESTIMATED NET CREDIT LOSSES,

PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST

PAID TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. CHANGES IN THE

ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATIONS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE

STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTES 14

AND 16 ON PAGES 114118 AND 121122,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO

REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE FIRM

TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY,

AND MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES,

SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE,

INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR

CONDUCTING AN INTERIM TEST. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS

PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING-UNIT LEVEL (WHICH IS

GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 33 ON PAGES 139141 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST

IS A COMPARISON, AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, OF

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR

VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, THEN THE

SECOND PART OF THE TEST IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THE

AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE

IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL

IS CALCULATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF GOODWILL RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

RECORDS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF REPORTING UNIT

GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT

GOODWILL, THEN THE FIRM WOULD RECOGNIZE AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE,

WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE AGAINST NET

INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE

DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS BASED

UPON EACH REPORTING UNITS INTERNAL FORECASTS. IN

ADDITION, ANALYSIS USING MARKET-BASED TRADING AND

TRANSACTION MULTIPLES, WHERE AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO

ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS DERIVED

FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS

123R AND ALL RELATED INTERPRETATIONS USING THE

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. SFAS 123R

REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES,

INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK-SETTLED

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT (SARS), TO BE MEASURED

AT THEIR GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO SFAS 123R, SEE NOTE 8 ON

PAGES 105107 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS

NO. 133 AND 140

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 155, WHICH

APPLIES TO CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WHICH ARE DEFINED AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT

CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. THE NEW STANDARD

ESTABLISHES A REQUIREMENT TO EVALUATE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO

DETERMINE IF THE INTERESTS REPRESENT FREESTANDING

DERIVATIVES OR ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REQUIRING

BIFURCATION. IT

ALSO PERMITS AN IRREVOCABLE ELECTION FOR FAIR VALUE

REMEASUREMENT OF ANY HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

CONTAINING AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE

WOULD REQUIRE BIFURCATION UNDER SFAS 133. THE FIRM

ADOPTED THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SFAS 155, SEE

NOTE 1 ON PAGE 95 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTING FOR SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN MARCH 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 156, WHICH IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST FISCAL

YEAR BEGINNING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2006, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED. JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO ADOPT

THE STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THE

STANDARD PERMITS AN ENTITY A ONE-TIME IRREVOCABLE

ELECTION TO ADOPT FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR A CLASS

OF SERVICING ASSETS. THE FIRM HAS DEFINED MSRS AS

ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS FOR THIS ELECTION.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FIRMS

ADOPTION OF SFAS 156 WITH RESPECT TO MSRS, SEE NOTE

16 ON PAGES 121122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 158, WHICH

REQUIRES RECOGNITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF

DEFINED BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN

ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 158 ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS ON

DECEMBER 31, 2006. SFAS 158 HAS NO IMPACT EITHER ON

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FIRMS PLAN ASSETS OR

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, OR ON HOW THE FIRM DETERMINES

ITS NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO SFAS 158, SEE NOTE 7 ON

PAGES 100105 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AND CHANGES IN TIMING OF CASH

FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED

LEASE

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED TWO PRONOUNCEMENTS.

FIN 48, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS 109, AND THE RELATED

FSP FAS 13-2. FIN 48 ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN, AND

ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION,

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, AND

DISCLOSURE. FSP FAS 13-2 REQUIRES THE RECALCULATION OF

RETURNS ON LEVERAGED LEASES IF THERE IS A CHANGE OR PROJECTED

CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES

GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE. THE FIRM WILL APPLY FIN 48

TO ALL OF ITS INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE

DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2007 UNDER THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF

THE INTERPRETATION. JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THAT THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO IMPLEMENT FIN 48 WILL

INCREASE THE JANUARY 1, 2007 BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS

BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD

CONTINUES TO BE INTERPRETED AND THE FASB IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON FIN 48, WHICH COULD AFFECT THIS

ESTIMATE. ACCORDINGLY, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL CONTINUE ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF FIN 48 ON ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE GUIDANCE IN FSP

FAS 13-2 WILL ALSO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM ON

JANUARY 1, 2007. IMPLEMENTATION OF FSP FAS 13-2

IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 157, WHICH IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15,

2007, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. SFAS 157 DEFINES FAIR

VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND

EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT

FAIR VALUE. THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF

FAIR VALUE WHICH FOCUSES ON EXIT PRICE AND PRIORITIZES, WITHIN A

MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE, THE USE OF MARKET-BASED INPUTS OVER

ENTITY-SPECIFIC INPUTS. THE STANDARD ALSO ESTABLISHES A

THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED ON THE

TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY

AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. SFAS 157 NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE

IN EITF 02-3 WHICH REQUIRED THE DEFERRAL OF PROFIT AT INCEPTION

OF A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IN

THE ABSENCE OF OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING THE VALUATION

TECHNIQUE. THE STANDARD ALSO ELIMINATES LARGE POSITION DISCOUNTS

FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS QUOTED IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES

CONSIDERATION OF NONPERFORMANCE RISK WHEN VALUING LIABILITIES.

CURRENTLY, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE PAYABLES

DOES NOT INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT JPMORGAN

CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

THE FIRM INTENDS TO EARLY ADOPT SFAS 157 EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007, AND EXPECTS TO RECORD A CUMULATIVE

EFFECT AFTER-TAX INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF

APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION RELATED TO THE RELEASE OF PROFIT

PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3. IN ORDER

TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THIS TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT AND TO

CONFIRM THAT THE FIRMS VALUATION POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT

WITH EXIT PRICE AS PRESCRIBED BY SFAS 157, THE FIRM

REVIEWED ITS DERIVATIVE VALUATIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL

AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INCLUDING RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN THE

MARKETPLACE, INDICATIVE PRICING SERVICES AND THE RESULTS OF BACK-TESTING SIMILAR TRANSACTION TYPES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM EXPECTS

TO RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO EARNINGS RELATED TO THE INCORPORATION

OF THE FIRMS NONPERFORMANCE RISK IN THE VALUATION OF

LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND FOR PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT MARKET EVIDENCE TO

SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN VALUE BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO THIRD-PARTY

MARKET TRANSACTION RELATED TO THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE

INVESTMENT. THE APPLICATION OF SFAS 157 INVOLVES JUDGEMENT

AND INTERPRETATION. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR AND EVALUATE

THE DEVELOPING INTERPRETATIONS.

FAIR

VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 159, WHICH IS

EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15,

2007, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. SFAS 159 PROVIDES AN

OPTION FOR COMPANIES TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE

MEASUREMENT FOR SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS, FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND WRITTEN LOAN

COMMITMENTS. UNDER SFAS 159, FAIR VALUE WOULD BE USED FOR

BOTH THE INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF THE DESIGNATED

ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS, WITH THE CHANGES IN VALUE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE FIRM IS REVIEWING THE RECENTLY

RELEASED STANDARD AND ASSESSING WHAT ELECTIONS IT MAY MAKE AS

PART OF AN EARLY ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF,

THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR

FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BOARD

OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS,

THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO

PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO..

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE & CO.S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS,

BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND

THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM

THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS,

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT,

INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL

- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR

OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL -

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT,

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING

SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN

THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT

PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF

RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND

FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF

THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR

THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE

FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH

OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN

INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION

PROCESSING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 33 ON PAGES 139141 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES

OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES

CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY BANK REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE MOST USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IS THE OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY

OF THE VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ENTITY. HOWEVER, A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ALSO MAY BE DEEMED

TO EXIST WITH RESPECT TO ENTITIES, SUCH AS SPECIAL

PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS

THAT DO NOT INVOLVE CONTROLLING VOTING INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS

AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY

BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR

CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY SET UP FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING

ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A

COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS

THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES

TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE

ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS.

SPES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE,

THEREBY INSULATING INVESTORS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE

CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER

OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS

APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE)

FRAMEWORK UNDER SFAS 140; AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46R. THE

APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY. THE

QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY

TRANSFERS (SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE

MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA DEFINED IN SFAS 140. THESE

CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES

OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF

THE FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT EXERCISE CONTROL OVER

THE ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN.

ENTITIES MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT

CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFEROR OR OTHER

COUNTERPARTIES, AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

UNILATERAL ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OR TO CAUSE THE

ENTITY NO LONGER TO MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA. THE

FIRM PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE QSPE MODEL FOR

SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD LOANS AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 114118

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN THE SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA,

CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46R.

UNDER FIN 46R, A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT.

(1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO

PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM

OTHER PARTIES; (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE

RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE

ENTITYS OPERATIONS; AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS

THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE

ENTITYS LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE

ENTITYS RETURNS.

FIN 46R REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E.,

A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF

THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED

LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS

PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN

MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, THE FIRM THOROUGHLY

EVALUATES THE VIES DESIGN, CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. WHEN

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED

THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM PERFORMS A

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPUTES AND ALLOCATES

EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS TO VARIABLE

INTEREST HOLDERS. THE ALLOCATION OF EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED UPON THE RELATIVE

CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF EACH INTEREST

HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE. FOR FURTHER

DETAILS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 118120 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO

BE VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES UNDER FIN 46R IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER

OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, AND THE FIRMS SHARE OF

INCOME OR LOSS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

ALL RETAINED INTERESTS AND SIGNIFICANT

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN

CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 9899 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR

FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OF REVENUE AND

EXPENSES, AND OF DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT

FROM THESE ESTIMATES. FOR DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM, SEE PAGES

8385 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN (I.E., NON-U.S.)

CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE

EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S. REPORTING

ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

CASH FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SFAS 155 APPLIES TO CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT

CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. THE STANDARD

ESTABLISHES A REQUIREMENT TO EVALUATE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO

DETERMINE IF THE INTERESTS REPRESENT FREESTANDING

DERIVATIVES OR ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REQUIRING

BIFURCATION. SFAS 155 ALSO PERMITS AN IRREVOCABLE

ELECTION FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ANY HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT CONTAINING AN EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD REQUIRE BIFURCATION

UNDER SFAS 133. THE FAIR VALUE ELECTION CAN BE

APPLIED TO EXISTING INSTRUMENTS ON AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS AT THE DATE OF

ADOPTION AND CAN BE APPLIED TO NEW INSTRUMENTS ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 155 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2006. THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO FAIR VALUE ALL

INSTRUMENTS ISSUED, ACQUIRED OR MODIFIED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE

BIFURCATED UNDER SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138,

SFAS 149 AND SFAS 155. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

ELECTED TO FAIR VALUE CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES

EXISTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, RESULTING IN A

$22 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED

EARNINGS. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT INCLUDES

GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF $29 MILLION AND GROSS

UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $7 MILLION.

THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE STRUCTURED NOTES TO

WHICH THE FAIR-VALUE ELECTION HAS BEEN APPLIED ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LONG-TERM DEBT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED

WITH STRUCTURED NOTES IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. FOR A DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS AND LONG-TERM DEBT, SEE NOTES 4 AND 19

ON PAGES 9899 AND 124125, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

MERGER WITH BANK ONE CORPORATION

BANK ONE CORPORATION MERGED WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE (THE

MERGER) ON JULY 1, 2004. AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF

BANK ONE WAS CONVERTED IN A STOCK-FOR-STOCK

EXCHANGE INTO 1.32 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. JPMORGAN CHASE STOCKHOLDERS KEPT

THEIR SHARES, WHICH REMAINED OUTSTANDING AND

UNCHANGED AS SHARES OF JPMORGAN CHASE FOLLOWING THE

MERGER. KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE MERGER WERE TO

PROVIDE THE FIRM WITH A MORE BALANCED BUSINESS MIX

AND GREATER GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. THE MERGER

WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF BANK ONE BE FAIR VALUED AS OF JULY

1, 2004. THE PURCHASE PRICE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

WAS $58.5 BILLION.

AS PART OF THE MERGER, CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES

AND PRACTICES WERE CONFORMED, WHICH RESULTED IN

$976 MILLION OF CHARGES IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT

COMPONENTS OF THE CONFORMITY CHARGES WERE A $1.4

BILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE DECERTIFICATION OF

THE SELLERS INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE BENEFIT OF A $584 MILLION

REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AS A

RESULT OF CONFORMING THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

CREDIT PROVISION METHODOLOGIES.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE HELD PRIMARILY

BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

(WHICH INCLUDES INVESTMENTS MADE BY JPMORGAN

PARTNERS AND ONE EQUITY PARTNERS). THE PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS INVESTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY

AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES.

ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY

PRIVATE EQUITY, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

THE PERIOD THAT THE GAINS OR LOSSES OCCUR.

PRIVATELY HELD INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED

BASED UPON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATELY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 7  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 87 AND SFAS

88, AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

(OPEB) PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS 106. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS

158, WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE ON THEIR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS THE OVERFUNDED OR

UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THEIR DEFINED BENEFIT

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS 158 REQUIRES UNRECOGNIZED

AMOUNTS (E.G., NET ACTUARIAL LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE

COSTS) TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND THAT THESE

AMOUNTS BE ADJUSTED AS THEY ARE SUBSEQUENTLY

RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT

COST BASED UPON THE CURRENT AMORTIZATION AND

RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 87 AND SFAS 106.

THE FIRM PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED SFAS 158 AS REQUIRED

ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, WHICH RESULTED IN A CHARGE TO

AOCI OF $1.1 BILLION.

SFAS 158 ALSO ELIMINATES THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 87

AND SFAS 106 THAT ALLOW PLAN ASSETS AND

OBLIGATIONS TO BE MEASURED AS OF A DATE NOT MORE

THAN THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE REPORTING ENTITYS

BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE FIRM USES A MEASUREMENT

DATE OF DECEMBER 31 FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS; THEREFORE, THIS PROVISION

OF SFAS 158 WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR

VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS OPEB PLANS, A

CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF

NET ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN

ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE

BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET ACTUARIAL GAIN OR

LOSS EXCEEDS 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS, AS WELL AS PRIOR

SERVICE COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE

FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY 10 YEARS. FOR

OPEB PLANS, ANY EXCESS NET ACTUARIAL GAINS AND

LOSSES ALSO ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE

SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SEVEN YEARS;

HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL

ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIVE YEARS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN

EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, IN THE FORM OF PAY

AND INTEREST CREDITS, TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO

BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED UPON ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN

TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR

OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER FIVE

YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS

THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING

EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED UPON

FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR

YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS

IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX

LAWS. AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE PENSION

PROTECTION ACT IN AUGUST 2006, WHICH INCREASED THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT ALLOWABLE FOR TAX DEDUCTION, THE

FIRM IS REVIEWING 2007 U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTION ALTERNATIVES. THE

AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2007 CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY, IS

NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS (I.E., U.S. PLANS NOT SUBJECT

TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

SECURITY ACT). THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS

IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS ON

COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED

BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN. THE EXCESS

RETIREMENT PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED, NONCONTRIBUTORY

U.S. PENSION PLAN WITH AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

IN THE AMOUNT OF $301 MILLION AND $273 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THIS PLAN HAS

BEEN INCORPORATED INTO CERTAIN OF THIS NOTES

TABLES FOR WHICH IT HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN PRIOR

YEARS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

PLANS IN THE U.S. AND IN CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS

THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K)

SAVINGS PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES

TO MAKE PRETAX CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN

CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT

OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A

NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. THE

FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO

A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND

LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A ONE-YEAR SERVICE

REQUIREMENT AND ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED IN THE

FIRMS CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN MADE. EMPLOYEES WITH

TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF $250,000 OR MORE

ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. THE

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY

PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING

COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A

SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH

LENGTH OF SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR

LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL

BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE CONTRIBUTORY,

WHILE THE LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE

NONCONTRIBUTORY. AS OF AUGUST 1, 2005, THE

ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES TO

QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE

WERE REVISED, AND LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE WAS

ELIMINATED FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES RETIRING AFTER

2005. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE

OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED

WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI)

PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES,

COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND

OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE

THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM

PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE

U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE FUNDED STATUS,

CHANGES IN THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND PLAN ASSETS,

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AND AOCI AMOUNTS

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR THE

FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

(A)

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE NET ACTUARIAL LOSS IS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF DECLINES IN DISCOUNT RATES IN RECENT YEARS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET GAINS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS NET ACTUARIAL LOSS INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE,

WHICH DIFFERS FROM EXPECTATIONS, AND CHANGES IN OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OPEB

PLANS, THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE CUMULATIVE ACTUARIAL LOSS WERE THE DECLINE IN THE

DISCOUNT RATE IN RECENT YEARS AND IN THE MEDICAL COST TREND RATE, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN

EXPECTED. THESE LOSSES HAVE BEEN OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE RECOGNITION OF FUTURE SAVINGS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO MEDICARE PART D SUBSIDY RECEIPTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT

ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY

THE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES

ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING

BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED

UPON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE

GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION,

EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED

LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE

GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL

BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE),

ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM

CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE

DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND

BOND MARKETS.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, WHICH

REPRESENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR

TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE

SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN

AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH

ASSET CLASS, SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON

LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND AA-RATED

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS, PLUS AN EQUITY RISK

PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE.

IN 2006 AND 2005, THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN

DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED

BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON A PORTFOLIO OF BONDS

WITH REDEMPTION DATES AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY

MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH

PORTFOLIO IS DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF

HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT

DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THIS HYPOTHETICAL BOND

PORTFOLIO GENERATES EXCESS

CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT

THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP

PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. PRIOR TO 2005, DISCOUNT RATES

WERE SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YEAR-END MOODYS

CORPORATE AA RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER HIGH-QUALITY

INDICES WITH A DURATION THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF

THE RESPECTIVE PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE

DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS REPRESENT RATES FROM THE YIELD CURVE

OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS

BOND INDEX WITH DURATIONS CORRESPONDING TO THOSE OF

THE UNDERLYING BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE FIRM INCREASED THE

DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET INTEREST

RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPENSE

OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION FOR 2007. THE 2007

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.50%. THE 2007 EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE FIRMS U.S. OPEB

PLAN ASSETS INCREASED FROM 6.84% TO 7.00%. THE FIRM

MAINTAINED THE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND

ASSUMPTION AT 10% FOR 2007, DECLINING TO AN

ULTIMATE RATE OF 5% IN 2014. THE INTEREST CREDITING

RATE ASSUMPTION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, USED TO

DETERMINE PENSION BENEFITS CHANGED PRIMARILY DUE TO

CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF $10 MILLION FOR 2007. THE

ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT

4.00% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

CHANGE TO THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS IN 2006 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

WERE LOWER DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE FIRMS NON-U.S.

PLANS, BOTH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB, DUE

TO LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES, RESULTING IN $23

MILLION HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2006

COMPARED WITH 2005.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OPEB PLAN EXPENSES ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.

WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A

25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN

AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION IN 2007

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSES. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE

IN 2007 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION AND AN

INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $217 MILLION. A

25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR

THE NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN

THE

2007 NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION. A 25-BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR

THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT

IN AN INCREASE IN 2007 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AND AN

INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $82 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE

RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE

RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY

MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER.

SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX

FOR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING

VARIOUS RISK FACTORS AND EACH PLANS INVESTMENT

RETURN OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S.

QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION, IN

RECOGNITION OF ITS LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ARE REBALANCED TO

WITHIN APPROVED RANGES, TO THE EXTENT ECONOMICALLY

PRACTICAL.

THE FIRMS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS

ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE INVESTED IN A

WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITIES (INCLUDING

U.S. LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALIZATION AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES), FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING

CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS), TREASURY

INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES, REAL

ESTATE, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENTS. NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE SIMILARLY

INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY,

FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE

FIRMS COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND

PARTIALLY THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE

ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED

IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS. IN

ADDITION, TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL DEBT SECURITIES,

HELD IN A TRUST, WERE USED TO FUND THE U.S. OPEB

PLAN IN PRIOR PERIODS; AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THERE ARE NO REMAINING ASSETS IN THE TRUST. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE ASSETS USED TO FUND THE

FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON

STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN

THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

NOTE 8  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS 123R AND ALL RELATED INTERPRETATIONS USING

THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. SFAS

123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), TO BE MEASURED AT THEIR GRANT DATE FAIR

VALUES. RESULTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN

RESTATED. THE FIRM ALSO ADOPTED THE TRANSITION

ELECTION PROVIDED BY FSP FAS 123(R)-3.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED SFAS 123,

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, USING THE PROSPECTIVE

TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER SFAS 123, THE FIRM

ACCOUNTED FOR ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

AT FAIR VALUE, SIMILAR TO THE SFAS 123R

REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE

TRANSITION METHOD, JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUED TO

ACCOUNT FOR UNMODIFIED STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE

OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, USING THE APB

25 INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, NO

EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AT

AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE STOCK PRICE ON THE

GRANT DATE, SINCE SUCH OPTIONS HAVE NO INTRINSIC

VALUE.

UPON ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRM BEGAN TO

RECOGNIZE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS

PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AN IMMATERIAL CUMULATIVE

EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RESULTING FROM THE SFAS 123R

REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE FORFEITURES AT THE GRANT

DATE INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING THEM AS INCURRED.

FINALLY, THE FIRM REVISED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES UNDER SFAS 123R.

PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING

POLICY FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WAS TO RECOGNIZE

COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS STATED SERVICE

PERIOD. FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES IN 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT

GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF POST

EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2006, THE FIRM ALSO BEGAN TO ACCRUE THE ESTIMATED

COST OF STOCK AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES IN JANUARY 2007.

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

THE FIRM HAS GRANTED RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS (RSUS), STOCK OPTIONS, AND

STOCK-SETTLED SARS TO

CERTAIN OF ITS EMPLOYEES.

IN 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM

STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2005 PLAN). IN 2005,

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS

UNDER THE 1996 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AS AMENDED

(THE 1996 PLAN) UNTIL MAY 2005 AND UNDER THE 2005

PLAN THEREAFTER TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. THESE TWO

PLANS, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS

THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (LTI PLANS). THE

2005 PLAN BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 17, 2005, AFTER

APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 2005 ANNUAL

MEETING. THE 2005 PLAN REPLACED THREE EXISTING

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS  THE 1996 PLAN AND

TWO NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLANS  ALL OF WHICH

EXPIRED IN MAY 2005. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2005

PLAN, 275 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE

AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE DURING ITS FIVE-YEAR TERM.

THE 2005 PLAN IS THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED

INCENTIVE AWARDS.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS ARE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN

CHASE AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT. THESE AWARDS ARE

SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

HAVE LAPSED, INCLUDING CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR A

SPECIFIED PERIOD. THE RECIPIENT OF A SHARE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO VOTING RIGHTS AND

DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK. AN RSU ENTITLES THE

RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AFTER

THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE; THE RECIPIENT IS

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY

DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK

DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING. EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 2005, THE EQUITY PORTION OF THE FIRMS

ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS WERE GRANTED PRIMARILY IN

THE FORM OF RSUS. THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY GRANTS

DISCRETIONARY SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS, PRIMARILY

IN THE FORM OF BOTH EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

SARS.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS HAVE

BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT

DATE. GENERALLY, OPTIONS AND SARS CANNOT BE

EXERCISED UNTIL AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT

DATE AND BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT. THESE

AWARDS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT

DATE. THE FIRMS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS

GENERALLY VEST IN MULTIPLE TRANCHES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

105

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT

WERE A SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE.

FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED (OTHER THAN GRANTS TO

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE AT THE GRANT

DATE), COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE

VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED

THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME RETIREMENT

ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR EACH

TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME

RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD,

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE

EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY

DATE OR THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRMS POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON

SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR

TREASURY SHARES. DURING 2006, THE FIRM ISSUED NEW

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH MAY

31, 2006, AND TREASURY SHARES FROM JUNE 1 THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

ON MARCH 21, 2006, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED

A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE

REPURCHASE OF UP TO $8 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON

SHARES, WHICH SUPERSEDES A $6 BILLION STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2004. THE $8 BILLION

AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO

OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES

REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS,

INCLUDING: MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL

CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION

(TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES);

INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE

POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR

TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET

PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR

UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE

SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME.

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FIRM ACCELERATED THE VESTING

OF APPROXIMATELY 41 MILLION UNVESTED,

OUT-OF-THE-MONEY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN

2001 UNDER THE GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

PROGRAM (GPIP), WHICH WERE SCHEDULED TO VEST IN

JANUARY 2007. THESE OPTIONS WERE NOT MODIFIED OTHER

THAN TO ACCELERATE VESTING. THE RELATED EXPENSE WAS

APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION, AND WAS RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

THE FIRM BELIEVED THAT AT THE TIME THE OPTIONS WERE

ACCELERATED THEY HAD LIMITED ECONOMIC VALUE SINCE

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE ACCELERATED OPTIONS

WAS $51.22 AND THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE FIRMS

COMMON STOCK ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

ACCELERATION WAS $39.69.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSU ACTIVITY

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS

IS MEASURED BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED

MULTIPLIED BY THE STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE,

AND IS RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME AS PREVIOUSLY

DESCRIBED. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES JPMORGAN

CHASES RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSU ACTIVITY FOR 2006.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND

2004, WAS $1.3 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $1.7

THE VESTING OF CERTAIN RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSU

AWARDS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2002 WAS CONDITIONED UPON

CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS BEING MET AND JPMORGAN

CHASES COMMON STOCK REACHING AND SUSTAINING TARGET

PRICES WITHIN A FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

DURING 2002, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NO

LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE TARGET STOCK PRICES

RELATED TO FORFEITABLE AWARDS GRANTED IN 1999,

2000, AND 2001 WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITHIN THEIR

RESPECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND ACCORDINGLY,

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES WERE REVERSED. THE

TARGET

STOCK PRICES FOR THESE AWARDS RANGED FROM $73.33 TO

$85.00. THESE AWARDS WERE FORFEITED AS FOLLOWS: 1.2

MILLION SHARES GRANTED IN 1999 WERE FORFEITED IN

JANUARY 2004; 1.2 MILLION SHARES GRANTED IN 2000

WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2005; AND 1.2 MILLION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R

DURING 2006, THE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

FIRMS ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R WAS $712 MILLION. THIS

AMOUNT REPRESENTS AN ACCELERATED NONCASH

RECOGNITION OF COSTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN

INCURRED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ALSO AS A RESULT OF

ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS (PRETAX) FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006,WAS LOWER BY $712 MILLION, AND

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (AFTER-TAX), AS

WELL AS NET INCOME, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2006, WAS LOWER BY $442 MILLION, THAN IF THE FIRM

HAD CONTINUED TO ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION UNDER APB 25 AND SFAS 123. BASIC AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME

PER SHARE, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

WERE $0.13 AND $0.12 LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN IF

THE FIRM HAD NOT ADOPTED SFAS 123R.

THE FIRM RECOGNIZED NONCASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO ITS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED

INCENTIVE AWARDS OF $2.4 BILLION (INCLUDING THE

$712 MILLION INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS

123R), $1.6 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $1.0

BILLION (PRETAX) OF COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO

UNVESTED AWARDS HAS NOT YET BEEN CHARGED TO NET

INCOME. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED INTO

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD

OF 1.2 YEARS. THE FIRM DOES NOT CAPITALIZE ANY

COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES.

CASH FLOWS AND TAX BENEFITS

THE TOTAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS RECOGNIZED

IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND

2004, WAS $947 MILLION, $625 MILLION AND $519

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRM PRESENTED

ALL TAX BENEFITS OF DEDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AS OPERATING CASH

FLOWS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH

FLOWS. SFAS 123R REQUIRES THE CASH FLOWS RESULTING

FROM THE TAX BENEFITS OF TAX DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS

OF THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS (I.E., EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS) TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING CASH

FLOWS. THE $302 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS

CLASSIFIED AS A FINANCING CASH INFLOW DURING 2006

WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS AN OPERATING CASH

INFLOW IF THE FIRM HAD NOT ADOPTED SFAS 123R.

NOTE 10  SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS,

HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING

SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 ON PAGE 98 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED

PRIMARILY AS AFS WHEN PURCHASED AS PART OF THE

FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE

RISK. AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES AFTER SFAS 133 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH

ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT

THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO

HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE

CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED

ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW

FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN FAIR VALUE. IF,

BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF EACH OF THE ABOVE

FACTORS, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE IMPAIRMENT IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS.

INCLUDED IN THE $546 MILLION OF GROSS UNREALIZED

LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS

$242 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT HAVE EXISTED

FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE

SECURITIES ARE PREDOMINATELY RATED AAA AND THE

UNREALIZED LOSSES PRIMARILY ARE DUE TO OVERALL

INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND NOT CONCERNS

REGARDING THE UNDERLYING CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS. THE

MAJORITY OF THE SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES

AGED GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS ARE OBLIGATIONS OF U.S.

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND HAVE A FAIR

VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THAT IS WITHIN 3% OF

NOTE 11  SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS,

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS,

PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY

POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT

POSITIONS AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO

ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

(RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) ARE

GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL

BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED

INTEREST. WHERE APPROPRIATE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED

ON A NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 41. JPMORGAN

CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED

UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY BASIS, JPMORGAN

CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY SECURITIES THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ITS

COUNTERPARTIES, AND REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

WHEN NECESSARY.

TRANSACTIONS SIMILAR TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT

DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS

RATHER THAN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE)

OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A FORWARD

OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE SECURITIES. THE

FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A DERIVATIVE,

IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

ITS FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED

IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE

RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED

OR RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY

OF GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE

MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES

BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES

RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 12  LOANS

LOANS THAT ARE ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY THE

FIRM AND THAT MANAGEMENT HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY

TO HOLD FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE ARE REPORTED AT

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY

NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES. LOANS THAT ARE EITHER

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY THE FIRM AND THAT

MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO SELL OR TO SECURITIZE ARE

CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND ARE CARRIED AT THE

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES

RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE ALSO RECORDED IN

NONINTEREST REVENUE. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED

USING THE INTEREST METHOD, OR ON A BASIS

APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM

OF THE LOAN.

LOANS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO

TO THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO WHEN MANAGEMENT

DECIDES TO SELL THE LOAN. TRANSFERS TO

HELD-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER; LOSSES

ATTRIBUTED TO CREDIT LOSSES ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LOSSES DUE TO

INTEREST RATES, OR EXCHANGE RATES, ARE RECOGNIZED

IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF

INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN

CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF

MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST

IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS 90

DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS

INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.

INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A

LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS REVERSED

AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE

AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS

SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS

RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN

CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE

ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL CASH

THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH LOANS. LOANS ARE RESTORED TO

ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL

PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS

ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY

CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED

STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(FFIEC) POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD LOANS

ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH

THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60

DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING OF

BANKRUPTCY, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER

CONSUMER PRODUCTS, IF COLLATERALIZED, ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 120 DAYS

PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS, AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS, EDUCATION

FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL

LOAN POLICY DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS

CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR

PAID IN FULL. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER

CONSUMER LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED AGAINST

INTEREST INCOME WHEN THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF. A

COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN IN-SUBSTANCE

FORECLOSURE AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED

IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER ASSETS, ONLY

WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION

OF THE COLLATERAL, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN

ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED

COMPONENT. WITHIN THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS A

STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO PROVISIONS

FOR LOSSES ON LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND

MEASURED PURSUANT TO SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR

COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF THE

LOAN IS LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT LOAN.

TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE

ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED

INDIVIDUALLY, AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE

EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING

WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS AND IS THE PRODUCT OF

A STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AS WELL AS ADJUSTMENTS

TO SUCH CALCULATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TAKE INTO

CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS

AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT

YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. FOR

RISK-RATED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE

WHOLESALE LINES OF

BUSINESS), THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK

RATING AND MATURITY. FOR SCORED LOANS (GENERALLY

LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE CONSUMER LINES OF

BUSINESS), LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING

STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS

TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE RISK-RATED

PORTFOLIOS ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED

RANGES USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT.

FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING

INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE

CALCULATION WHERE RELEVANT. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE SCORED LOAN

PORTFOLIOS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING

THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR

PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE

RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC

AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING

CREDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE

FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED

IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR

PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO

THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO,

MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES

OF DRAWDOWN.

AT LEAST

QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF

RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE

FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES

OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE

(I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET

NOTE 14  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY

OF ITS CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS. CONSUMER

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SECURITIZATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL

REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS THAT

ARE ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY RETAIL FINANCIAL

SERVICES (RFS), AND CARD SERVICES (CS). WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE SECURITIZATIONS OF PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL

REAL ESTATE LOANS AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY

REAL ESTATERELATED) ORIGINATED BY THE INVESTMENT

BANK (IB).

JPMORGAN CHASESPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE

SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE

SPES ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A

QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 94 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT

REFLECTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

(EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW)

BUT ARE INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE QSPE

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A

SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE

MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS

ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS; (2)

THE ENTITY CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE FINANCIAL

ASSETS OR, IF THE ENTITY IS A QSPE, ITS INVESTORS

CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THEIR INTERESTS; AND (3) THE

FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL VIA AN

AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS

BEFORE THEIR MATURITY OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO

UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING

SALES CRITERIA, THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED

DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE

LOANS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE LOANS SOLD

AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS, BASED UPON THEIR

RELATIVE FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE OF SALE. GAINS ON

SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE. WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR THE RETAINED

INTERESTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

FAIR VALUE FOR THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY

DETERMINING THE

PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING

MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES, SUCH

AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND

THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS

INVOLVED.

INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS MAY BE RETAINED

BY THE FIRM IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED

INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED

TRANCHES, AND ESCROW ACCOUNTS. THE CLASSIFICATION

OF RETAINED INTERESTS IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF INTEREST (E.G.,

WHETHER THE RETAINED INTEREST IS REPRESENTED BY A

SECURITY CERTIFICATE) AND WHEN IT WAS RETAINED, DUE

TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 155. THE FIRM HAS ELECTED

TO FAIR VALUE ALL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS

RETAINED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2005, THAT HAVE AN

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE REQUIRED TO BE BIFURCATED UNDER

SFAS 155; THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED

PRIMARILY AS TRADING ASSETS. RETAINED INTERESTS

FROM WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING

ASSETS. FOR CONSUMER ACTIVITIES, SENIOR AND

SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS REPRESENTED BY A

SECURITY CERTIFICATE ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS.

RETAINED INTERESTS NOT REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY

CERTIFICATE ARE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER ASSETS. FOR

THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

PREPAYMENT RISK (SUCH THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY NOT

RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT) BUT

ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE BIFURCATED UNDER SFAS 155,

THE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE;

SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS OR

IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). RETAINED

INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS AFS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS OF

EITF 99-20.

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM

TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE

TRUSTS, REPRESENTING THE FIRMS INTERESTS IN THE

RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THAT HAVE NOT

BEEN SECURITIZED. THESE SELLERS INTERESTS ARE NOT

REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE FIRMS

UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST

AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LOANS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND (2) CLIENT INTER- MEDIATION; BOTH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE IB

ALSO SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH QSPES, TO CREATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS FURTHER

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 114118 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM): PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER

OF THE FIRMS MUTUAL FUNDS DEEMED VIES. AM EARNS A FIXED FEE BASED UPON ASSETS MANAGED;

THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE

LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AMS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH FUNDS ARE NOT

CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES. THESE

SERVICES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED

FEES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE

INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



COMMERCIAL BANKING: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF PRODUCTS

SIMILAR TO THOSE OFFERED IN THE INVESTMENT BANK.

COMMERCIAL BANKING MAY ASSIST IN THE STRUCTURING AND/OR ON-GOING ADMINISTRATION OF THESE

VIES AND MAY PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE VIE. SUCH

RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES

THAT COULD BE DEEMED VIES. PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE INVESTMENT COMPANY AUDIT GUIDE (AUDIT GUIDE). THE FASB DEFERRED ADOPTION OF FIN 46R

FOR NONREGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES THAT APPLY THE AUDIT GUIDE UNTIL THE PROPOSED

STATEMENT OF POSITION ON THE CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT GUIDE IS FINALIZED. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO APPLY THIS DEFERRAL PROVISION; HAD FIN 46R BEEN APPLIED TO VIES

SUBJECT TO THIS DEFERRAL, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES WITH WHICH THE IB IS

INVOLVED: MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, HELPING MEET

CUSTOMERS FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THESE COMPANIES ARE SEPARATE

BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE COMPANIES IN THE BUSINESS OF

PURCHASING INTERESTS IN, AND MAKING LOANS SECURED

BY, RECEIVABLE POOLS AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE

COMPANIES FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE

PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS.

JPMORGAN CHASE SERVES AS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND

PROVIDES CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AND LIMITED

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR SEVERAL MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE

CONDUITS IS BACKED BY COLLATERAL, CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY

SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE CONDUIT TO RECEIVE A

LIQUIDITY RATING OF AT LEAST A-1, P-1 AND, IN

CERTAIN CASES, F1.

AS A MEANS OF ENSURING TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE

CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED

SUCH THAT THE LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED BY THE FIRM

PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL OF

NONDEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS. DEAL-SPECIFIC

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS.

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES VEHICLES WITH PROGRAM-WIDE

LIQUIDITY, IN THE FORM OF REVOLVING AND SHORT-TERM

LENDING COMMITMENTS, IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM

DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET.

DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE CONDUITS IS

GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF

HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS

AND IS PROVIDED PRIMARILY BY CUSTOMERS (I.E.,

SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER BUT

ALSO MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING.

RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH

COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS

SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE

FIRM PROVIDES LIMITED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE

FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FIRM RESTRUCTURED FOUR

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THAT IT ADMINISTERS: EACH

CONDUIT ISSUED A CAPITAL NOTE THAT WAS ACQUIRED BY

AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY INVESTOR WHO ABSORBS THE

MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE RESPECTIVE

CONDUIT WHOSE NOTE IT HAD PURCHASED. IN DETERMINING

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS, THE FIRM

USED A MONTE CARLOBASED MODEL TO SIZE THE EXPECTED

LOSSES AND CONSIDERED THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND

OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST

HOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING, THE FIRM

DECONSOLIDATED APPROXIMATELY $33 BILLION OF ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2006. THE FOLLOWING

TABLE SUMMARIZES THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH

FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS.

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF DRAWN

COMMITMENTS (I.E., SELLERS ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR WHICH THE FIRM

PROVIDES LIQUIDITY SUPPORT) OF $43.9 BILLION AND $41.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY, PLUS CONTRACTUAL BUT UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS OF $24.1 BILLION AND $21.6

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WERE DECONSOLIDATED AS OF JUNE 30,

2006; THE ASSETS DECONSOLIDATED WERE APPROXIMATELY $33 BILLION. SINCE THE FIRM PROVIDES

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND LIQUIDITY TO FIRM ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, THE MAXIMUM

EXPOSURE IS NOT ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD BE ABSORBED BY THIRD-PARTY

LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS.

THE FIRM VIEWS ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AS LIMITED. THIS

IS BECAUSE, FOR THE MOST PART, THE FIRM IS NOT

REQUIRED TO FUND UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IF

THE ASSETS IN THE VIE ARE IN DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY,

THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

ARE SECONDARY TO THE RISK OF FIRST LOSS PROVIDED BY

THE CUSTOMER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES  FOR EXAMPLE,

BY THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF THE VIE WITH THE

ASSETS SOLD TO IT OR NOTES SUBORDINATED TO THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED

IN STRUCTURING VIE TRANSACTIONS TO MEET INVESTOR

AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES VARIOUS

TYPES OF RISKS (INCLUDING FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND

CREDIT), TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS

FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT

TO THE VIES TO FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION. THE

FIRMS CURRENT EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IS

REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR IN

THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

RISKS INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO

OTHER CREDIT, MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES

PRINCIPALLY WITH THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF VIES.

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES AND MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

119

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM STRUCTURES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES IN

WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY RATED ASSETS (SUCH

AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES) AND ENTERS INTO A

CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN

EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT NOT HELD BY THE

VIE. CREDIT-LINKED NOTES ARE ISSUED BY THE VIE TO

TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE

INVESTORS IN THE VIE. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN

PREFER A VIE STRUCTURE, SINCE THE CREDIT-LINKED

NOTES GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN

THEY WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A SERIES OF SECONDARY MARKET TRUSTS THAT

ALLOW TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS TO FINANCE THEIR

INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. THE VIE

PURCHASES FIXED-RATE, LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED

MUNICIPAL BONDS BY ISSUING PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES AND INVERSE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES; THE INVESTORS THAT PURCHASE THE

INVERSE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE EXPOSED TO

THE RESIDUAL LOSSES OF THE VIE (THE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS). FOR VEHICLES IN WHICH THE FIRM OWNS

THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE

VIE. IN VEHICLES IN WHICH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN

THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS

LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE UNWIND TRIGGERS

BASED UPON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD

PARTIES. THE FIRM OFTEN SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT

FOR THE VIE AND PROVIDES LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT THE

REMARKETING.

ASSETS HELD BY CREDIT-LINKED AND MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, WERE AS

TOTAL LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WERE $10.2 BILLION AND $5.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRMS MAXIMUM CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ALL MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES WAS

$14.9 BILLION AND $10.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES

STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR,

UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN.

THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH,

AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE BASED UPON THE

ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

WHERE THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASE

TO ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE

VIES OR TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL

RETURNS OF THE VIE, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS AND

REPORTS THESE POSITIONS SIMILARLY TO ANY OTHER

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT

CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES INCLUDED

INTERESTS IN RECEIVABLES PURCHASED BY

FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS, WHICH HAD BEEN

CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46R. INTERESTS

IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES WERE CARRIED AT COST AND

REVIEWED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EXISTED.

THE INTEREST-BEARING BENEFICIAL INTEREST

LIABILITIES ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN THE LINE ITEM TITLED, BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE

HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE

RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN CHASE.

SEE NOTE 19 ON PAGE 124 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR

THE MATURITY PROFILE OF FIN 46 LONG-TERM BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS.

FIN 46(R)-6 TRANSITION

IN APRIL 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN 46(R)-6,

WHICH REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS OF THE DESIGN OF A VIE

IN DETERMINING THE VARIABILITY TO BE CONSIDERED IN

THE APPLICATION OF FIN 46(R). THE FIRM ADOPTED THE

GUIDANCE IN FSP FIN 46(R)-6 PROSPECTIVELY ON JULY

1, 2006. THE ADOPTION OF FSP FIN 46(R)-6 DID NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH THE FIRM

EVALUATED ITS INTERESTS IN VIES UNDER FIN 46(R);

THUS, IT HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 16  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. IT IS INSTEAD TESTED

FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142 AT THE

REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE

LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 33 ON PAGES 139141

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY (WHICH

IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). GOODWILL IS TESTED

ANNUALLY (DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE OFTEN

IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES

IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE

IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE

FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. THE

IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED

TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, SUCH AS CORE DEPOSITS AND

CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST

REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE INTANGIBLE

ASSET. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED

PERIODICALLY ON THESE AMORTIZING INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

CONSUMER, BUSINESS BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET

BANKING BUSINESSES OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK, AS WELL

AS $510 MILLION OF GOODWILL RESULTING FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES. THE

INCREASE FROM ACQUISITIONS WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

A REDUCTION TO GOODWILL: OF $402 MILLION DUE TO THE

SALE OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES TO THE

BANK OF NEW YORK; RESULTING FROM PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION

OF THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS; OF $111

MILLION DUE TO THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS;

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE

RIGHT TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE

OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST,

AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX AND

INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS;

MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF

THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE AMOUNT INITIALLY CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS

THE AMOUNT PAID TO THIRD PARTIES TO ACQUIRE MSRS OR

IS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, IF RETAINED UPON THE

SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS FOR INITIAL

CAPITALIZATION AND ONGOING VALUATION USING AN

OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) MODEL, WHICH

PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE

SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS

PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS

THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL

CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY

SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS,

DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY

REVENUES, AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO

RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO

EXPERIENCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES OR HAS USED

COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES, AFS SECURITIES AND

TRADING INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS.

MSRS DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND

CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES

FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE

WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

IN MARCH 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 156, WHICH

PERMITS AN ENTITY A ONE-TIME IRREVOCABLE ELECTION TO

ADOPT FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR A CLASS OF

SERVICING ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO ADOPT

THE STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND DEFINED

MSRS AS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS FOR THIS

ELECTION. AT THE TRANSITION DATE, THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE MSRS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT, NET OF ANY

RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE, BY $150 MILLION NET OF

TAXES. THIS AMOUNT WAS RECORDED AS A

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006. MSRS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, AND

CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE RECORDED IN

CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. DURING 2006, AS IN PRIOR

YEARS, REVENUE AMOUNTS RELATED TO MSRS AND THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USED TO MANAGE THE RISK OF

MSRS ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED

INCOME.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

MSRS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 140, USING A

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE APPROACH. UNDER THIS

APPROACH, MSRS WERE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE

ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME RECEIVED IN PROPORTION TO,

AND OVER THE PERIOD OF, THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET

SERVICING INCOME STREAM OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE

LOANS. FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND MEASURING

IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIED THE

PORTFOLIO ON THE BASIS OF THE PREDOMINANT RISK

CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH ARE LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST

RATE. ANY INDICATED IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED AS A

REDUCTION IN REVENUE THROUGH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE,

WHICH REPRESENTED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING

VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRATUM EXCEEDED ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. ANY GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND

RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AMOUNTS WHICH WERE

NOT EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE, BASED UPON THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, WERE

CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

121

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 156, THE FIRM

DESIGNATED CERTAIN DERIVATIVES USED TO RISK MANAGE

MSRS (E.G., A COMBINATION OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS AND

FLOORS) AS SFAS 133 FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE RISK. SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING

ALLOWED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED MSRS TO BE

ADJUSTED THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT

THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES WAS

RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS. THE DESIGNATED HEDGE

PERIOD WAS DAILY. IN DESIGNATING THE BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE, THE FIRM CONSIDERED THE IMPACT THAT

THE CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK RATE HAD ON THE

PREPAYMENT SPEED ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE MSRS. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS WAS ASSESSED

USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE MSRS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN

BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES AND OF THE CHANGE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES. THE

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO BOTH THE MSRS AND SFAS 133

DERIVATIVES WERE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND

RELATED INCOME. WITH THE ELECTION TO APPLY FAIR

VALUE ACCOUNTING TO THE MSRS UNDER SFAS 156, SFAS

133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGES 131132 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY

NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT

A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE

FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER

ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY

RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT MAGNIFY

OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES.

NOTE 22  EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. BASIC EPS IS

COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO

COMMON STOCK BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF

COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED

EPS IS COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHOD AS BASIC EPS

BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, THE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES REFLECT, IN ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING SHARES,

THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE

COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED INTO

COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK

IS THE SAME FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED EPS, AS

JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, AND

THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE

FOR COMMON STOCK WERE NECESSARY. THE FOLLOWING

TABLE PRESENTS THE CALCULATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED

EPS FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 24  INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A

CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET-AND-LIABILITY METHOD

REQUIRED BY SFAS 109 TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL

TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES

REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES.

ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR

EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT

WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE

REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES

INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT

EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO

REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE

NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A

SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE.

AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE

AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM

FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL

YEARS. THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT THAN

THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED.

INCREASE OF $885 MILLION, $425 MILLION AND $431

MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON

THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE

BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF

TIME. FOR 2006, SUCH EARNINGS APPROXIMATED $423

MILLION ON A PRETAX BASIS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX

EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $1.9

BILLION. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE AT THIS TIME TO

DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD

RESULT UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

OF 2004 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT

CREATED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO

REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS AT A

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY

PROVIDING A DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON THE

REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE

U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION PROVISION). THE

DEDUCTION WAS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS

AND REQUIREMENTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005,

THE FIRM APPLIED THE REPATRIATION PROVISION TO $1.9

BILLION OF CASH FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS, RESULTING IN

A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $55 MILLION. THE $1.9 BILLION

OF CASH WAS INVESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS

DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN PURSUANT TO THE

GUIDELINES SET FORTH IN THE ACT.

NOTE 25  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND

INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT

TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC).

THE BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE

SYSTEM AND ITS DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC).

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE

BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES

WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS

APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION IN 2006 AND $2.7 BILLION

IN 2005.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE

LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH

SECURED LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES

ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING

SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE

RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT

OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING

SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME

(ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND

INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE

OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND

RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE OCC AND THE FDIC

HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT

OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY

SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION,

PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2007 AND 2006, JPMORGAN CHASES

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$14.3 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT

BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS

IN 2007 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS

ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, CASH IN THE AMOUNT

OF $8.6 BILLION AND $6.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.1 BILLION

AND $2.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED

IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF

SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 26  CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL.

TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL

INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING

PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS GOODWILL

AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF

PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1,

SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY CAPITAL IS

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, JPMORGAN

CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF

TIER 1 AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO

RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO

AVERAGE ADJUSTED ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE

TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO TAKE ACTION. BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY

REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

LITIGATION RESERVE

THE FIRM MAINTAINS LITIGATION RESERVES FOR CERTAIN

OF ITS OUTSTANDING LITIGATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 5, JPMORGAN CHASE ACCRUES

FOR A LITIGATION-RELATED LIABILITY WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT SUCH A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, IN LIGHT

OF ALL INFORMATION KNOWN TO IT AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE FIRMS LITIGATION RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE

AT SUCH DATE. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS LITIGATION

RESERVES PERIODICALLY, AND THE RESERVES MAY BE

INCREASED OR DECREASED IN THE FUTURE TO REFLECT

FURTHER LITIGATION DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES

IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO CLAIMS ASSERTED

AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LITIGATION

AND, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LITIGATION, INTENDS TO

CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY, LITIGATING OR

SETTLING CASES ACCORDING TO MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT

AS TO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

STOCKHOLDERS.

INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE $512 MILLION AND $208

MILLION IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. CHARGES

RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE

$2.8 BILLION AND $3.7 BILLION IN 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO CHARGES IN 2006 RELATED

TO MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

NOTE 28  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END USERS TO

INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR

MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST RATE PRICES

OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN

DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO IS AN END-USER

OF DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES,

MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED

BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

BOTH TRADING AND END-USER DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING

LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 4 ON PAGES 9899

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138, SFAS 149, AND

SFAS 155, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

THOSE USED FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS.

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED

FOR HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO

BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF

A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONTRACT IS FOR

TRADING PURPOSES OR HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND

QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A

DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE

BEING HEDGED. IN ORDER FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE

DESIGNATED AS A

HEDGE, THERE MUST BE DOCUMENTATION OF THE RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY, INCLUDING

IDENTIFICATION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE

HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK EXPOSURE, AND HOW

EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND

RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM

USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION

ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS

INCLUDING DOLLAR VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

THE EXTENT TO WHICH A HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN

AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT

ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH

FLOWS MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST

QUARTERLY. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS MUST BE REPORTED IN

CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A

DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE

DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS

DISCONTINUED.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED

ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE

REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE ITEM AND

CONTINUES TO BE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD

ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED

CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED

OCCUR, CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY.

FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR

ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY RELATED

DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR

QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE REVALUATION OF

THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENT

ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT

WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY

INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, LOANS,

AFS SECURITIES AND MSRS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED TO

MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, CONVERTING

FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A FLOATING

RATE. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 156, INTEREST

RATE OPTIONS, SWAPTIONS AND FORWARDS WERE ALSO USED

IN COMBINATION WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS MSRS IN SFAS 133 HEDGE

RELATIONSHIPS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSR RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

121122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALL AMOUNTS HAVE

BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE

CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME, MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME,

AND OTHER INCOME. THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY

GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2006, 2005 OR 2004 ON FIRM

COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH

FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN

CURRENCYDENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS

ARE THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS USED TO REDUCE THE

IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES ON FUTURE EARNINGS. ALL AMOUNTS AFFECTING

EARNINGS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE

CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

AND FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS

TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE PORTION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

(FORWARD POINTS) IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST

131

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT

$67 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) OF NET LOSSES RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH

OF TIME OVER WHICH FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS ARE

HEDGED IS 10 YEARS, AND SUCH TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY

RELATE TO CORE LENDING AND BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE FIRMS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TO STANDARD CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO

MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS

BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH

CONTRACTS AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133. SIMILARLY, THE

FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES USED AS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

NOTE 29  OFFBALANCE SHEET

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS

CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW

DOWN THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE

COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING

TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT

OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS

NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS

ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE

CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN

WHOLESALE-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS

MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 113114 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A

GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A

GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING

THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A

CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR

TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES

IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY

SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD

PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED

AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING

OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE

GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45: CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL

GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS,

CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN

THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE

DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.

THE FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION OF THE OBLIGATION

UNDERTAKEN WHEN ISSUING THE GUARANTEES AND

COMMITMENTS THAT QUALIFY UNDER FIN 45 IS TYPICALLY

EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE AMOUNT

OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM

HAS RECORDED THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH

AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. AS

CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, IT IS APPLIED

TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS,

AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT

INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING &

DEPOSIT RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE

CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO

FIN 45 GUARANTEES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $297

MILLION AND $313 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE

NOT GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE

PRINCIPALLY USED AS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY TO SPES, PRIMARILY MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS,

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES 118120 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. SOME OF THESE ASSET PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS CAN BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME BY THE

SPES ADMINISTRATOR, WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE A

TRIGGERING EVENT TO OCCUR. TRIGGERING EVENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A NEED FOR

LIQUIDITY, A DECLINE

132

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

IN MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR A DOWNGRADE IN

AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET

FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS FAIR

VALUE, IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE

INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE

OF THE AGREEMENT. IN MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY

CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS

POTENTIAL LOSSES ON THESE AGREEMENTS.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A

CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN

ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES,

BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE AND

SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THESE

ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE FIRM

TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO RECOVER FROM THE

CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE GUARANTEES;

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD CASH OR OTHER

HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THESE

GUARANTEES.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

THROUGH THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM,

CUSTOMERS SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND

NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD

PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM ISSUES

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO

THE LENDER WHICH PROTECTS IT PRINCIPALLY AGAINST

THE FAILURE OF THE THIRD-PARTY BORROWER TO RETURN

THE LENT SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS CASH

OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET

VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES

ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO

HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS

CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS OR RELEASED TO THE

BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF

AN INDEMNIFIABLE DEFAULT BY A BORROWER OCCURS, THE

FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE

REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT

THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT

THEREOF.

ALSO AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE

FIRM INVESTS CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM THE

BORROWER IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED GUIDELINES.

ON AN EXCEPTIONAL BASIS THE FIRM MAY INDEMNIFY THE

LENDER AGAINST THIS INVESTMENT RISK WHEN CERTAIN

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE MADE.

BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THESE RISKS OF LOSS ARE REMOTE.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS,

THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN

TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A

TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO

SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE; THUS, SUCH A

CLAUSE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT

UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT

THE TERMINATION CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT

SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO

ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES WHEN IT SELLS A

BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY, PURSUANT TO

WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES THAT THIRD PARTY FOR LOSSES IT

MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO

THE SALE. SEE BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING

THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE

UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE

THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES

IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE

AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED.

HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES

114118 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM PROVIDES

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT CERTAIN

SECURITIZED LOANS MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE

FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR

INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES

DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR

WARRANTIES. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER

SUCH REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS

WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD

BY SUCH SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2006, PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED

AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN

EXPENSES. THE POTENTIAL LOSS DUE TO SUCH REPURCHASE

AND/OR INDEMNITY IS MITIGATED BY THE DUE DILIGENCE

THE FIRM PERFORMS BEFORE THE SALE TO ENSURE THAT

THE ASSETS COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH

IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED ON SUCH REPURCHASES

AND/OR INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT,

AND THEREFORE MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF

MATERIAL LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

THE FIRM IS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING

COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT

VENTURE OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC (THE JOINT VENTURE).

THE JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 2005, AS A

RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT BY THE FIRM AND FIRST DATA

CORPORATION, ITS JOINT VENTURE PARTNER, TO

INTEGRATE THE COMPANIES JOINTLY OWNED CHASE

MERCHANT SERVICES (CMS) AND PAYMENTECH MERCHANT

BUSINESSES. THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDES MERCHANT

PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA. UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC. AND

MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A., IS LIABLE PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH

PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE

SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A

MERCHANT. THE JOINT VENTURE IS CONTRACTUALLY LIABLE

TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. FOR THESE DISPUTED

TRANSACTIONS. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE

CARDMEMBERS FAVOR, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL (THROUGH

THE CARDMEMBERS ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE

AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE

TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF THE JOINT VENTURE

IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT,

THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT

CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. THE JOINT

VENTURE MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE

SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY

OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY

EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS

UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND;

(2) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER

REFUNDS; AND (3) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE

SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER

REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. WOULD BE LIABLE

FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION, ALTHOUGH IT

WOULD HAVE A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO RECOVER FROM ITS

JOINT VENTURE PARTNER AN AMOUNT PROPORTIONATE TO

SUCH PARTNERS EQUITY INTEREST IN THE JOINT

VENTURE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE

JOINT VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF

$9 MILLION ON $661 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME

PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE JOINT VENTURE

HELD $893 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CMS AND PAYMENTECH VENTURES INCURRED

AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $11 MILLION ON $563

BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $909 MILLION OF

COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED UPON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY

THE JOINT VENTURE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS

CHARGEBACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS WOULD NOT BE

DIFFERENT MATERIALLY FROM THE CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE

RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE; THEREFORE, THE FIRM

HAS NOT RECORDED ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IN EXCESS

OF THE ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

EXCHANGE AND CLEARINGHOUSE GUARANTEES

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND

FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARING-HOUSES, BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN

SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO

PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE

ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER

MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT

ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO

MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO

THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE

FIRMS CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTY FUND,

OR, IN A FEW CASES, IT MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE

UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD

REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE

MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED.

HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE

ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM

IS A COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR

VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS

THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE

OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED

DATE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES THAT

EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON A

COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. THE

TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE

FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS $72 BILLION AND $62

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE

CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS

OR BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET

RISK RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUE

RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLE OF $230 MILLION AND $198 MILLION, AND A

DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $987 MILLION AND $767 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND CREDIT

DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH SETTLEMENT AND DO NOT

REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR THE BUYER OF CREDIT

PROTECTION TO OWN THE REFERENCE ASSET. THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES

UNDER FIN 45.

NOTE 30  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A

NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC

REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES

THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS

OF THE CREDIT RISK PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN

DEEMED NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED

PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE

EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S.

GEOGRAPHIC REGION.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE LOAN

PRODUCT WITH VARYING TERMS (E.G., INTEREST-ONLY

PAYMENTS FOR AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD) OR EXPOSURE TO

LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS WOULD RESULT

IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.

TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING

CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 31  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE

AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED

IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES,

OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY MAY

DIFFER BASED UPON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT AND/OR

ITS USE IN A TRADING OR INVESTING STRATEGY.

GENERALLY, THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE

FOLLOWING.



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME;



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN THE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND AS PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME;



AT COST (LESS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS), WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE NOT

RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES THERETO; OR



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS

THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENT

INFORMATION AS INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE

THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUIDITY AND

CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND ARE BASED UPON DEFINED

METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER

TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS

NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE

LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. MARKET PRACTICE IS

TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO A AA CREDIT RATING; THUS, ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED

TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. AN ADJUSTMENT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY AND TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.



LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A

RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE)

MARKETS. THUS, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO A LACK OF LIQUIDITY ARE

APPLIED TO THOSE POSITIONS TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION BASED UPON

THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY OR ILLIQUIDITY, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF THE MARKET IN WHICH THE

INSTRUMENT TRADES AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM

MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME

SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT

EXTERNAL QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT.



CONCENTRATION VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF UNWINDING

LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS. THE COST IS DETER- MINED BASED UPON THE

SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO

OCCUR DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING

A POSITION DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL. AN

ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD NEEDED TO REDUCE, WITHOUT

MARKET DISRUPTION, A POSITION TO A NONCONCENTRATED

LEVEL IS GENERALLY BASED UPON THE RELATIONSHIP OF

THE POSITION TO THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME

OF THAT POSITION. WITHOUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS,

LARGER POSITIONS WOULD BE VALUED AT A PRICE

GREATER THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FIRM COULD

EXIT THE POSITIONS.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE CONTROLLED BY A PRICE

VERIFICATION GROUP, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE

RISK-TAKING FUNCTION. ECONOMIC SUBSTANTIATION OF

MODELS, PRICES, MARKET INPUTS AND REVENUE THROUGH

PRICE/INPUT TESTING, AS WELL AS BACK-TESTING, IS

DONE TO VALIDATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE

THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR

VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF

NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR

VALUES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A

DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING

DATE.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS

107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

REQUIRED BY SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL

ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM

RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS

DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT

CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT

VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS

NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING ITEMS DESCRIBE THE METHODOLOGIES

AND ASSUMPTIONS USED, BY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

THE FIRM CONSIDERS FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL

ASSETS CARRIED AT COST  INCLUDING CASH AND DUE

FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES

BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED

INTEREST RECEIVABLE  TO APPROXIMATE THEIR

RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM

NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT

MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET

ITEM ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED RESALE AGREEMENTS

AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES.

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS,

CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE

MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

TRADING DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRMS DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE

CARRIED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, WHEN AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING INSTRUMENTS. IF

QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FAIR

VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING MODELS,

QUOTED PRICES OF INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS, OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

SECURITIES

FAIR VALUES OF ACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE

DETERMINED BY QUOTED EXTERNAL DEALER PRICES, WHILE

THE FAIR VALUES FOR NONACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES

ARE BASED UPON INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

135

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE FOR DERIVATIVES IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING.



POSITION VALUATION, PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON LIQUID MARKET PRICING AS EVIDENCED BY

EXCHANGE-TRADED PRICES, BROKER-DEALER QUOTATIONS OR RELATED INPUT PARAMETERS, WHICH ASSUME

ALL COUNTERPARTIES HAVE THE SAME CREDIT RATING;



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESULTING PORTFOLIO VALUATION, TO REFLECT THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES; AND



OTHER FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LIQUIDITY, CONCENTRATION AND

OTHER FACTORS.

FOR THOSE DERIVATIVES VALUED BASED UPON MODELS WITH

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, THE

FIRM DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS

RECOGNIZED IN TRADING REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS

(TYPICALLY STRAIGHT-LINE AMORTIZATION OVER THE LIFE

OF THE INSTRUMENTS) AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

BECOMES AVAILABLE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DOES NOT

INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT

JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES

THE FAIR VALUE OF VARIABLE-RATE INTERESTS IN

PURCHASED RECEIVABLES APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING AMOUNTS DUE TO THEIR VARIABLE INTEREST

TERMS AND NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES FOR FIXED-RATE INTERESTS IN PURCHASED

RECEIVABLES ARE DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSIS USING APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

LOANS

FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS IS DETERMINED USING

METHODOLOGIES SUITABLE FOR EACH TYPE OF LOAN.



FAIR VALUE FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS ESTIMATED, PRIMARILY USING THE COST

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN RECOVERY RATES

BETWEEN BONDS, UPON WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS.



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS) AND

CONSUMER REAL ESTATE, FOR WHICH MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE,

ARE BASED UPON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR

CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE CURRENT RATES OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS. FOR CONSUMER

REAL ESTATE, SECONDARY MARKET YIELDS FOR COMPARABLE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ADJUSTED

FOR RISK, ARE USED.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED UPON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS.

THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF

INTEREST RATE CHANGES, SINCE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ALREADY REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR

CREDIT RISK.



THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS IS GENERALLY

BASED UPON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND UPON PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK;

THAT RISK IS DISCOUNTED, USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY.

OTHER

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE. FOR THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES

INVENTORY, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO

PRICES IN HIGHLY ACTIVE AND LIQUID MARKETS. THE

FAIR VALUE FOR OTHER COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS

DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICING AND DATA DERIVED

FROM THE MARKETS ON WHICH THE UNDERLYING

COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. MARKET PRICES USED MAY BE

ADJUSTED FOR LIQUIDITY. THIS CAPTION ALSO INCLUDES

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MSRS. FOR DISCUSSION

OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 9899 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY

FOR RETAINED INTERESTS RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS,

SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 114118 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR

MSRS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 121122 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT

LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND,

SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE

EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES NOT

ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING

VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, OTHER BORROWED

FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS

CONSIDERED TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING

VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS ARE

ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS USING THE

APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE

MATURITY.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE; AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF

THESE TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES CARRYING

VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM ALSO INCLUDES

STRUCTURED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR

PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH FLOWS

ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES

FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

TRADING LIABILITIES

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR

TRADING DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS AND

DERIVATIVES, SEE THE RELATED DISCUSSIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL ASSETS SECTION OF THIS NOTE.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

(BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM

IN NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT

MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS ALSO INCLUDE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET

RATES.

LONG-TERM DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES HELD BY

TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES, IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND

IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR

WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

(WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN

RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, UPON WHICH THE COST

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS) AND LOAN

EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED UPON THE FIRMS

AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS). THE

FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS CONSUMER

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED UPON THE PRIMARY

MARKET PRICES TO ORIGINATE NEW COMMITMENTS. IT IS

THE CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES THAT

PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

COMMITMENTS. ON THIS BASIS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS A LIABILITY OF $0.2

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $0.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005.

BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE CUSTOMERS

RESIDING OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., AND THE INFORMATION

PRESENTED BELOW IS BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE

DOMICILE OF THE CUSTOMER OR THE LOCATION FROM WHICH

THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP IS MANAGED. HOWEVER, MANY

OF THE FIRMS U.S. OPERATIONS SERVE INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESSES.

AS THE FIRMS OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED,

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 33  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO SIX MAJOR

REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS INVESTMENT BANK,

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES,

COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB), TREASURY & SECURITIES

SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A

CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE SEGMENTS ARE BASED UPON THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED OR THE TYPE OF

CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN

WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED

BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS

ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION

OF MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE

FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ON PAGES 3233 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION CONCERNING

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE BUSINESS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 3435 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE MODIFIED

CERTAIN OF ITS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES TO REFLECT

MORE CLOSELY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE MANAGED AND TO PROVIDE

IMPROVED COMPARABILITY WITH COMPETITORS. THESE

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REVISIONS ARE REFLECTED IN

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, AND THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE

DISCLOSURE CHANGES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN EFFECT

THROUGHOUT ALL PERIODS REPORTED. A SUMMARY OF THE

CHANGES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

REPORTED VERSUS OPERATING BASIS CHANGES

THE PRESENTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS THAT EXCLUDED

MERGER COSTS AND MATERIAL LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES

AND RECOVERIES FROM REPORTED RESULTS HAS BEEN

ELIMINATED. THESE ITEMS HAD BEEN EXCLUDED PREVIOUSLY

FROM OPERATING RESULTS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEEMED

NONRECURRING; THEY ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST

INCOME IS NO LONGER RECLASSIFIED FROM NET INTEREST

INCOME TO TRADING REVENUE. AS A RESULT OF THESE

CHANGES, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, MANAGEMENT HAS

DISCONTINUED REPORTING ON AN OPERATING BASIS.

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCLOSURES

VARIOUS WHOLESALE BANKING CLIENTS, TOGETHER WITH

THE RELATED BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT

ITEMS, WERE TRANSFERRED AMONG CB, IB AND TSS. THE

PRIMARY CLIENT TRANSFER WAS CORPORATE MORTGAGE

FINANCE FROM CB TO IB AND TSS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM REFINED ITS

METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL (I.E., EQUITY)

TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

REFINEMENT, RFS, CS, CB, TSS AND AM HAVE HIGHER

AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THEM, COMMENCING IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. THE REVISED METHODOLOGY

CONSIDERS FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH BUSINESS

SEGMENTS ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE MERGER. IN

MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE REVISED METHODOLOGY ASSIGNS

RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO GENERATE

RETURNS ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL SUPPORTING

ACQUISITION-RELATED GOODWILL. AS PART OF THIS

REFINEMENT IN THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY,

THE FIRM ASSIGNED TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AN

AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL EQUAL TO THE THEN-CURRENT

BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL FROM AND PRIOR TO THE

MERGER. AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO

REFLECT THE NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS, CAPITAL

ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR

2006 IS NOT COMPARABLE TO PRIOR PERIODS AND CERTAIN

BUSINESS METRICS, SUCH AS ROE, ARE NOT COMPARABLE

TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE FIRM MAY REVISE

ITS EQUITY CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AGAIN IN

THE FUTURE.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION WITH THE BANK OF

NEW YORK, SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES HAVE

BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM TSS TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT

AND REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL

PERIODS REPORTED.

TOTAL FIRM RESULTS ARE ON A REPORTED BASIS. THE

FIRST SIX

MONTHS OF 2004 REFLECT HERITAGE JPMORGAN

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT

REVIEWS THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S.

GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON NET

INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS OR BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE.

(B)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

(C)

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES THE IB MANAGES ON BEHALF OF

CLIENTS THE SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS

REVISED TO BE BASED UPON PRETAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE

EXPOSURES. PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED UPON PRETAX EARNINGS,

PLUS THE ALLOCATED CAPITAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHARED CLIENTS.

(D)

INCLUDES MERGER COSTS WHICH ARE REPORTED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT. MERGER COSTS

ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE

EFFECT OF RELATED DERIVATIVES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF

PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS

ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

SEE NOTE 10 ON PAGE 109. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS WAS $16,109 MILLION, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE

OBLIGATIONS WAS $46,143 MILLION AND OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $32,569 MILLION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY

OBLIGATIONS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS HELD-TO-MATURITY

SECURITIES WAS $110 MILLION. THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2004.

(D)

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES MORTGAGED-BACKED

SECURITIES (MBSS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS

OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED

FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR

YEARS FOR MBSS AND CMOS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES WERE THE ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES

EXCEEDED 10% OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER

31, 2006.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE

DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. BASED ON NEW RULES FROM THE

FFIEC, BEGINNING IN 2006 SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

ARE NOW ALLOCATED TO A COUNTRY BASED UPON THE DOMICILE OF THE

COUNTERPARTY; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE BASED UPON THE DOMICILE OF THE

UNDERLYING SECURITYS ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY, LOCAL FOREIGN OFFICE

COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN COMMITMENTS; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE

EXCLUDED FROM COMMITMENTS. PRIOR PERIOD DATA WERE NOT REVISED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES

SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN

EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC

METHODOLOGIES RELATE TO THE TREATMENTS OF LOCAL COUNTRY EXPOSURE

AND TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES.
