AMERICA (U.S.),  WITH $2.2 TRILLION IN ASSETS,  $166.9 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK,  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,  N.A.),  A

NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN 23 STATES,  AND

CHASE BANK USA,  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE BANK USA,

N.A.),  A

NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRMS CREDIT CARDISSUING

BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN

SECURITIES INC. (JPMORGAN SECURITIES),  THE FIRMS U.S. INVESTMENT

BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES,  REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE

MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE,  THROUGH ITS WEBSITE,  ANNUAL REPORTS

ON FORM 10-K,  QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON

FORM 8-K,  AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED

PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934,  AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY

FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH,  OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO,  THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED,  AND

POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE,  A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER,  CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,  CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND

OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED,  FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING

PURPOSES,  INTO SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS,  AS WELL AS CORPORATE/PRIVATE

EQUITY. THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE INVESTMENT

BANK,  COMMERCIAL BANKING,  TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT SEGMENTS. THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES COMPRISE THE

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES SEGMENTS.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(MD&A),  BEGINNING ON PAGE 40 AND IN NOTE 37 ON PAGE 214.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,  INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES,  MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES,  MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES,  MORTGAGE

BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE

FINANCING COMPANIES,  LEASING COMPANIES,

E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES,  AND A VARIETY OF

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND RANGE

OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,  TRANSACTION EXECUTION,  INNOVATION AND

PRICE. COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS,  JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY;

WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS,  THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO

DEPENDS UPON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL,  AND ON ITS

REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED

CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS,  AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED AND,  IN

SOME CASES,  FAILED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN

COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER

CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES,  SUCH AS A BROADER

RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC

DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL

BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES

CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME LARGER OR

BETTER CAPITALIZED,  OR THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER

LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S.,  AS WELL AS THE

APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS

JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH THE FIRM

DOES BUSINESS.

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE

ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF

MARCH 13,  2000,  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA). UNDER REGULATIONS

IMPLEMENTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE

FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD), IF ANY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR

MANAGEMENT STANDARDS,  THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY

IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL

REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND

PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE

BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION,  THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF

THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF

THE DEFICIENCIES

PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF

ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A

SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY

REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL

ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31,  2008,  THE

DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE MET THE CAPITAL,  MANAGEMENT AND CRA

REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO

CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER

GLBA. HOWEVER,  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS

WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE

MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN

UNAFFILIATED BANK. PURSUANT TO THE RIEGLE-NEAL

INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF

1994 (THE RIEGLE-NEAL ACT), THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD MAY APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR SUCH AN

ACQUISITION WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE

TRANSACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAW OF ANY

STATE,  PROVIDED THAT THE ACQUIRING BANK HOLDING

COMPANY,  BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION,  DOES NOT

CONTROL MORE THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT

OF DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN

THE U.S. OR MORE THAN 30% (OR SUCH

GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNTS AS PERMITTED UNDER STATE

LAW) OF THE TOTAL DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACQUIRED

BANK HAS ITS HOME OFFICE OR A BRANCH.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA

REGULATOR,  AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL

AUTHORITIES BASED UPON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES

OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,  N.A.,

AND CHASE BANK USA,  N.A.,  ARE REGULATED BY THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

(OCC). SEE OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

BELOW FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY

SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL

BANKS. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA,  N.A.,  AS NATIONAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE,  ARE LIMITED TO THE

LESSER OF THE

AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT EARNINGS TEST

AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT

EARNINGS TEST,  A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE

TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY

CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS

NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF

THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS,  UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK

OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE

UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST,  A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID

IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE NOTE

29 ON PAGE 199 FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE

FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY,  AT

JANUARY 1,  2009 AND 2008,  TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR

BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED

ABOVE,  THE OCC,  THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE

FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS

THEY SUPERVISE,  INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

BANK AND BANK HOLDING

ORGANIZATION.

RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM, SEE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM ON PAGE 72.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS

HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS

CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM

STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY

ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFFBALANCE SHEET

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED

CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING

REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS

REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES,

CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL

AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL

MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL

CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2

CAPITAL. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE

ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE

LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED

BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH REFLECTS

ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3%

FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED

STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR

WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED

TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS,

DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK

PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED

BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL

ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING

SUPERVISION. IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED

A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). U.S. BANKING

REGULATORS PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN

DECEMBER 2007 WHICH REQUIRES JPMORGAN CHASE TO

IMPLEMENT BASEL II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS

WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS KEY U.S. BANK

SUBSIDIARIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING

BASEL II, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGE 72.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, THE SEC AUTHORIZED

JPMORGAN SECURITIES TO USE THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD

OF COMPUTING NET CAPITAL FOR BROKER/DEALERS THAT

ARE PART OF CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITIES AS

DEFINED BY SEC RULES. ACCORDINGLY, JPMORGAN

SECURITIES MAY CALCULATE DEDUCTIONS FOR MARKET RISK

USING ITS INTERNAL MARKET RISK MODELS. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS

REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

7173 AND NOTE 30 ON PAGES 200201.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A

FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING

COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS.

AS PART OF THAT FRAMEWORK, THE FDICIA REQUIRES THE RELEVANT

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET

CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL

BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN

INSTITUTIONS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL

CATEGORIES. THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS AND

NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN

CHASE; HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE

IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE

HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE

UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING

INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION

PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES

FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT

GUARANTEE.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

UNDER CURRENT FDIC REGULATIONS,

EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO A RISK

CATEGORY BASED ON CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES.

A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSESSED INSURANCE

PREMIUMS BY THE FDIC BASED ON ITS RISK CATEGORY AND

THE AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS HELD. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER 2008, THE AMOUNT OF FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE

FOR INSURED DEPOSITS WAS INCREASED UNDER THE

EESA, GENERALLY FROM $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR TO

$250,000 PER DEPOSITOR, AND PURSUANT TO THE

FIRMS PARTICIPATION IN THE FDICS TLG PROGRAM INSURED DEPOSITS HELD IN

NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS ARE NOW

FULLY INSURED. THESE INCREASES IN INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE

SCHEDULED TO END ON DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FDIC HAS

STATED ITS INTENTION, AS PART OF ITS PROPOSED

DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND

RESTORATION PLAN, TO INCREASE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

ASSESSMENTS. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE FDIC INCREASED

ITS ASSESSMENT RATES, AND HAS PROPOSED FURTHER RATE

INCREASES AND CHANGES TO THE CURRENT RISK-BASED

ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS

PARTICIPATION IN THE TLG PROGRAM, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO PAY

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO THE FDIC IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AN

ANNUALIZED 10-BASIS POINTS ON BALANCES IN NONINTEREST-BEARING

TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS THAT EXCEED THE $250,000 DEPOSIT INSURANCE LIMIT,

DETERMINED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS

INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN

CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION

UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING

IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN FDIC

CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF

PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR

RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON

ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE

FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO

A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE

THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO

REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO

WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE

PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO

BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR

REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO

PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD

BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING,

WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR

SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY

THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS

PUBLIC NOTE HOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT

LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE

DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER

UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING

PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S.

OFFICES, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER

RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER

OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY

OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OR

DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF

THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION,

SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., OR CHASE BANK

USA, N.A., SUCH PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED

DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING,

SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S.

OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT (BSA)

REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT

MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.

THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORDKEEPING AND

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH AND SUSPICIOUS

ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE

DILIGENCE/KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION

REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMPLY

WITH BSA REQUIREMENTS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH

TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT THESE SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER,

BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS

REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY

OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE

FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH

PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING

RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON

EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER

TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR

SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES.

THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER

AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGE 199.

THE FIRMS BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE

AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED

FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN

CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA,

N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY

THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY

GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF

ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT

BANKS BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AND IMPOSITION OF

PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON

INVESTMENTS, AMONG OTHER POWERS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING

AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. THROUGH

JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY

REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK

EXCHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMILAR

SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. SUBJECT TO

LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE OPERATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE SEC.

THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF

FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD AND ARE

REGISTERED ACCORDINGLY. IN THE U.S., THREE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION

MERCHANTS, WITH OTHER SUBSIDIARIES REGISTERED WITH

THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE

CFTC) AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY

TRADING ADVISORS. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL

FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRMS U.S. ENERGY

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL

ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

OTHER EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES,

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

BOTH IN THE U.S. AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY.

THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY

ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF

THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND

CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL

LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT

OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT

COLLECTION PRACTICE AND ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER

ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE

STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON CONSUMER LOAN

ORIGINATION AND COLLECTION PRACTICES.

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED

PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS

THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO

THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH

JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS, AND THE

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION.

UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 115.

HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR

ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER REPORTS THAT WE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT US. YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL

POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT US.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE

LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CORPORATE OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;

INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,

ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR

EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES. THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACTIVITY

LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR

INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES;

THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM OUR PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES; THE

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE WE RECEIVE

FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS WE MANAGE ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS;

AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR

UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY US.

WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS AND WE MAY HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING POSITIONS IN

SECURITIES IN MARKETS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM

MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT

STANDING; OUR SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND

COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS; AND OTHER

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REVENUE RELATING TO OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENT BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT PRICING OR OUR

ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

EARNINGS.

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING

MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS WE MANAGE OR HOLD IN CUSTODY, WHICH,

IN TURN, COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT WE RECEIVE.

OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS

INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

THE DETERIORATION OF THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN

DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

DURING 2008, U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF LIQUIDITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL

SECTOR,

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, REDUCED BUSINESS ACTIVITY, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, DECLINING HOME

PRICES, AND EROSION OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WHEN SUCH

CONDITIONS WILL AMELIORATE.

IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. SOME

POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE

MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER

ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN

OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER

CONFIDENCE IN US OR OUR PROSPECTS.

THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE LIQUIDITY

CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR

TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS. IF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE, OUR LIQUIDITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ACCESS TO

LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO US,

THEREBY CURTAILING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS

OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT COULD ALSO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO US

BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING. CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING

HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG

CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY

MONITORING PROCEDURES.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES)

OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS AND

MARKET-DRIVEN, AND INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. AS SUCH, OUR CREDIT

SPREADS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE RELY ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR OUR CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE

FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE SOUNDNESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES AND LENDING COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO MANY DIFFERENT

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

PRODUCTS

AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

OUR EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS. WE ESTIMATE AND ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR

CREDIT RISKS AND POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THIS PROCESS, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION,

REQUIRES DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW THESE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR BORROWERS TO REPAY THEIR LOANS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY

SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT WE WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR

THAT WE WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY. ANY SUCH FAILURE

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK

IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET ILLIQUIDITY, SUCH AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008. DURING SUCH PERIODS, OUR CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE

FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES

THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO US. IN

ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES IN

TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH LOSSES WOULD NOT

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS.

AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS

THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (LBHI). ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2008, LBHI FILED A

VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE (THE

BANKRUPTCY CODE) IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND

THEREAFTER SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11

OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE COURT (LBHI AND SUCH SUBSIDIARIES COLLECTIVELY, LEHMAN). ON

SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, A LIQUIDATION CASE UNDER THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT WAS COMMENCED

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR LEHMAN BROTHERS INC.

(LBI), LBHIS U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, AND THE COURT NOW PRESIDES OVER THE LBI SIPA

LIQUIDATION CASE. WE WERE LBIS CLEARING BANK AND ARE THE LARGEST SECURED CREDITOR IN THE LEHMAN

AND LBI CASES, ACCORDING TO LEHMANS SCHEDULES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US

AND/OR OUR SECURITY INTERESTS, INCLUDING BY THE LBHI CREDITORS COMMITTEE, THE SIPA TRUSTEE

APPOINTED IN THE LBI LIQUIDATION CASE, THE PRINCIPAL ACQUIROR OF LBIS ASSETS, AND OTHERS IN

CONNECTION WITH LEHMAN AND LBI CASES. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELF AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS.

AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF OUR

CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO US

WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR

REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME

INDUSTRY, THEREBY EXACERBATING OUR CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES, INCLUDING

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES, WE COULD INCUR IN OUR TRADING, CLEARING, AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO

ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND ANY CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK COULD

INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN

THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO SELL,

SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS HELD BY US,

THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS

OF SUCH POSITIONS. THESE CONCENTRATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO

LOSSES IF THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS

DECLINE CAUSING US TO TAKE WRITE DOWNS. MOREOVER, THE INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS NOT ONLY

INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL

OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO US.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO US. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES

AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK,

OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG

OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT WE HAVE NOT

APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, WE

COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET

ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO

DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

OUR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT

COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT

EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME

CORRELATED MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE

DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS THAT WE DO NOW OWN; IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS

OTHERWISE DUE TO US AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND

ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MANY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT CLEARED AND

SETTLED THROUGH A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE OR EXCHANGE, AND THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE CONFIRMED OR

SETTLED BY COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THESE SITUATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, WE MAY FIND THE CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT

TO ENFORCE. FURTHER, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING

THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF THE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE US TO INCUR

UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LEGAL COSTS, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

EFFECTIVELY OUR RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET

BEHAVIOR, AND ALL

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY US ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR

ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIES, CAUSING US TO INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS OUR BUSINESSES GROW AND THE MARKETS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT

PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR

MANAGED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY, POLITICAL, LEGAL

AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN

THE UNITED STATES. ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING

AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO

MATERIALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, SUCH AS DEBT SECURITIES AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). ITS POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWERS, POTENTIALLY

INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF THESE

CHANGES ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

OUR BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VARIOUS

UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR INVEST, OR IN

WHICH WE MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS,

INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER

NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND A

LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE

COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING

IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT

OF THE ABOVE

CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE

SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES. ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EMERGENCE OF A WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY OR PANDEMIC ALSO COULD CREATE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL

DISRUPTION THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATIONS OR IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

OUR BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD.

OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE IT TO SIGNIFICANT COST

AND LIABILITY.

WE ENGAGE IN POWER GENERATION, AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANK, WE ENGAGE IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES,

INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER,

EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES,

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE EXPECT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES

ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, LIABILITY MAY BE

INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR REMEDIATION

OF CONTAMINATIONS. OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSES US TO THE

RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS,

RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT

COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND

SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF

PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND

DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. WE ATTEMPT TO

MITIGATE OUR RISKS, BUT OUR ACTIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN

ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY,

FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR

INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY SUCH EVENTS.

WE RELY ON OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA

PART I

PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE

ARE SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR

OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES OUR OPERATIONS OR

SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO US,

INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF

THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN

POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN OUR POSSESSION WERE

TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF SUCH

INFORMATION WERE ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION,

EITHER BY FAULT OF OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION IS

INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISEASE PANDEMICS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR

PHYSICAL ASSETS, OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS.

SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO US.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS US, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE

RISK THAT OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE

DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING US TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT

COVERED BY INSURANCE.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY. WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL

LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE TYPE AND MANNER IN WHICH WE

DO BUSINESS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR

RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS AND SERVICES PROVIDED.

RECENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO NEW LEGISLATION AND NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR

CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION AND REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. IN RESPONSE TO SUCH MARKET AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, THE FDIC, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS,

HAVE TAKEN A

VARIETY OF EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES DESIGNED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCREASE

LIQUIDITY AND TO STRENGTHEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON OCTOBER 3, 2008 AND ON FEBRUARY

17, 2009, THE EESA AND THE ARRA, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. THESE LAWS ARE

INTENDED TO PROVIDE FISCAL STIMULUS AND STABILITY TO THE U.S. ECONOMY, BY AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PERMITTING THE U.S. TREASURY TO MAKE DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PURSUANT TO THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, AS TO THE ACTUAL IMPACT THAT THESE

LAWS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM, WILL HAVE ON THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FAILURE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO STABILIZE AND A CONTINUATION OR

WORSENING OF CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ACCESS TO CREDIT OR THE

TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PARTICIPATION IN CURRENT OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO RECENT MARKET EVENTS

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO RESTRICTIONS AND ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT ON THE MANNER IN

WHICH WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, AND

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM, AS AMENDED BY THE ARRA, THE CONSENT OF THE U.S. TREASURY IS

REQUIRED FOR US TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASE OUR COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE LAST QUARTERLY STOCK DIVIDEND

DECLARED BY US PRIOR TO OCTOBER 14, 2008 OR, EXCEPT IN LIMITED

CIRCUMSTANCES, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER PREFERRED STOCK UNLESS THE SERIES K PREFERRED

STOCK THAT WAS ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN REDEEMED OR

THE U.S. TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED ALL OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK TO A THIRD PARTY. THE ARRA

ALSO IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PAY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO CERTAIN OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY REASON OF OUR PARTICIPATION

IN THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM OR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WILL NOT

HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEW

LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD CAUSE BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

REVENUE, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WE MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING

IN, IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 18, 2008, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM ADOPTED

ENHANCED REGULATIONS FOR CREDIT CARDS THROUGH AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION Z, WHICH IMPLEMENTS THE

TRUTH-IN-LENDING ACT, AND ALSO NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES

UNDER THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT. THESE REGULATORY CHANGES WILL REQUIRE US TO INVEST

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURE AND SYSTEM CHANGES,

AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS MAY BY ENACTED OR PROMULGATED IN THE FUTURE, AND WE ARE

UNABLE TO PREDICT THE FORM SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION MAY TAKE, OR THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE WOULD

NEED TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESSES OR OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION. FOR

EXAMPLE, PROPOSED LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD AMEND TO THE BANKRUPTCY

CODE TO PERMIT MODIFICATIONS OF CERTAIN MORTGAGES THAT ARE SECURED BY A CHAPTER 13 DEBTORS

PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. PROPOSED LEGISLATION HAS ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, PRESCRIBE WHEN INTEREST CAN BE CHARGED ON REVOLVING CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, PRESCRIBE

WHEN AND HOW INTEREST RATES CAN BE INCREASED, LIMIT EVENTS OF DEFAULT THAT CAN RESULT IN INTEREST

RATE INCREASES ON EXISTING BALANCES, RESTRICT THE IMPOSITION OF CERTAIN FEES, REQUIRE A SPECIFIED

CUTOFF HOUR WHEN PAYMENTS MUST BE CREDITED TO ACCOUNTS, PRESCRIBE HOW PAYMENTS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO

OUTSTANDING BALANCES ON ACCOUNTS AND RESTRICT THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT CARDS FOR PERSONS UNDER 21

YEARS OF AGE EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IF ANY SUCH

LEGISLATION WERE ENACTED THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE DO

NOT COMPLY WITH THE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR

OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR

MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT

YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS

AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. IF THIS REGULATORY TREND

CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN

ADDITION, ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION ARISING FROM THE FAILURE OR PERCEIVED

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL, REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS OR TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM

PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US.

WE ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS

ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR

PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS,

SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO US, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE US SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL

HARM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR

BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WE EXPECT COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER,

BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER

ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES. CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING 2008, AS SEVERAL MAJOR U.S.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MERGED, WERE FORCED TO SELL ASSETS AND, IN SOME CASES FAILED.

WE ALSO FACE AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND

COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES

PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER

INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS

OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT

DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE.

INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES

IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE US TO EXTEND

MORE OF OUR CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS

ANTICIPATED.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS,

INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE

INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED

ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE

COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS,

SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. INTEGRATION EFFORTS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.

GIVEN THE CONTINUED MARKET VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY, WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED

CREDIT COSTS OR NEED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS AND ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE ASSETS AND

LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER (THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER)

BY AND AMONG JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS (WASHINGTON MUTUAL) BANKING OPERATIONS (THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION) THAT COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT AS OUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS CONTINUE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, OTHER

UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO REMOVE THEIR ACCOUNTS FROM US AND MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN

THE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND

POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS,

DEPOSITORS AND EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS.

DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR ATTRACTING AND MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS,

INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO OUR

BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO OUR REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM

STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING US, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY

ALSO RESULT IN HARM TO OUR PROSPECTS.

WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG OUR CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE

TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH

US, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO US.

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE.

OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS

CURRENTLY, OR THAT MAY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, IMPOSED ON US AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM OR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND

ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, OUR PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD

CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

INCLUDING IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE

OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAKE JUDGMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS OF SPES. IF IT IS

LATER DETERMINED THAT NON-CONSOLIDATED SPES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED, THIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, RELATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL RATIOS AND, IF THE SPES

ASSETS INCLUDE UNREALIZED LOSSES, COULD REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE THOSE LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN

REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN

ORDER TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE MAY

MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY

RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE

NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, BEING BASED ON

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN

PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET

ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR

ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO DECLINES IN OUR EARNINGS.

UNITED KINGDOM, JPMORGAN CHASE LEASED

APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE

SPACE AND OWNED A 360,000 SQUARE-FOOT OPERATIONS

CENTER AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

IN 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED A 999-YEAR

LEASEHOLD INTEREST IN LAND AT CANARY WHARF,

LONDON. IT IS INTENDED TO BE THE FUTURE SITE FOR

CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS

BUILDING, WHICH CAN CONTAIN UP

TO APPROXIMATELY 1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE

AND HAVE UP TO FIVE TRADING FLOORS OF

APPROXIMATELY 80,000 SQUARE FEET EACH. JPMORGAN

CHASE, BY AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER, HAS THE

ABILITY TO DEFER COMMENCEMENT OF THE MAIN

CONSTRUCTION THROUGH AT LEAST OCTOBER 2010. THE

BUILDING DESIGN WILL STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST

POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY RATING.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION,

LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF

OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS, AGGREGATING

APPROXIMATELY 3.2 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF

SPACE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE

ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AND FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT

AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY DETERMINE

FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CERTAIN OF ITS PREMISES AND

FACILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR ITS

OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM

WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF ANY SUCH EXCESS PREMISES

OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION

WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS. SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED

MATTERS.

VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS HAVE

COMMENCED PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST BEAR

STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER OFFICERS AND/OR

DIRECTORS ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS WHO PURCHASED OR

OTHERWISE ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OF BEAR STEARNS

BETWEEN DECEMBER 14, 2006 AND MARCH 14, 2008 (THE

CLASS PERIOD). THE ACTIONS, ORIGINALLY COMMENCED

IN SEVERAL UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS, ALLEGE

THAT THE DEFENDANTS ISSUED MATERIALLY FALSE AND

MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING BEAR STEARNS

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THAT, AS A

RESULT OF THOSE FALSE STATEMENTS, BEAR STEARNS

COMMON STOCK TRADED AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES

DURING THE CLASS PERIOD. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

ALLEGATIONS, THE COMPLAINTS ASSERT CLAIMS FOR

VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. SEPARATELY,

SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS OF BEAR STEARNS

HAVE COMMENCED OR THREATENED TO COMMENCE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND LAWSUITS

ASSERTING CLAIMS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS FORMER

OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS

COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK PURPORTING TO

REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE BEAR

STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP)

DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF DECEMBER 2006 THROUGH THE

DATE OF

THE COMPLAINTS. THESE

ACTIONS ALLEGE DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY

DUTIES

TO PLAINTIFFS AND TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS AND

BENEFICIARIES OF THE ESOP BY (A) FAILING TO

PRUDENTLY MANAGE THE ESOPS INVESTMENT IN BEAR

STEARNS SECURITIES; (B) FAILING TO COMMUNICATE FULLY

AND ACCURATELY ABOUT THE RISKS OF THE ESOPS

INVESTMENT IN BEAR STEARNS STOCK; (C) FAILING TO

AVOID OR ADDRESS ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; AND

(D) FAILING TO MONITOR THOSE WHO MANAGED AND

ADMINISTERED THE ESOP. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

ALLEGATIONS, EACH PLAINTIFF ASSERTS CLAIMS FOR

VIOLATIONS UNDER VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AND SEEKS

REIMBURSEMENT TO THE ESOP FOR ALL LOSSES, AN

UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF MONETARY DAMAGES AND

IMPOSITION OF A CONSECUTIVE TRUST.

FURTHERMORE, FORMER MEMBERS OF BEAR STEARNS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF BEAR STEARNS FORMER

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN

TWO PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS, EACH OF

WHICH WAS COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. BEAR

STEARNS WAS NAMED AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT IN BOTH

ACTIONS. BY COURT ORDER DATED FEBRUARY 14, 2008,

THE ACTIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED. A CONSOLIDATED

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON MARCH 3, 2008,

ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY,

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WASTE OF

CORPORATE ASSETS AND GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST

ENRICHMENT, ABUSE OF CONTROL AND INDEMNIFICATION

AND CONTRIBUTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOSSES

SUSTAINED BY BEAR STEARNS AS A RESULT OF ITS

PURCHASES OF SUB-PRIME LOANS AND CERTAIN

REPURCHASES OF ITS OWN COMMON STOCK. CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALSO ALLEGED TO HAVE SOLD

THEIR HOLDINGS OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK

WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC

INFORMATION. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT AND

AN ORDER DIRECTING BEAR STEARNS TO IMPROVE ITS

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES.

ON AUGUST 18, 2008, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON

MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (MDL PANEL) ISSUED A

TRANSFER ORDER JOINING FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES

BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALL THEN-PENDING

SECURITIES AND ERISA ACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY

LATER-FILED ACTIONS, MAKING ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING

WHETHER BEAR STEARNS AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT

AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS KNOWINGLY MADE

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL HEALTH THAT MISLED INVESTORS

AND CAUSED INVESTOR LOSSES WHEN THE COMPANYS STOCK

SHAREHOLDERS DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT WAS ALSO THE

SUBJECT OF THE TRANSFER ORDER. ALL SUCH ACTIONS

WERE ASSIGNED TO DISTRICT JUDGE ROBERT SWEET. BY

ORDER DATED JANUARY 5, 2009, DISTRICT JUDGE SWEET

ORDERED THE VARIOUS PUTATIVE SECURITIES CLASS

ACTIONS TO BE CONSOLIDATED, AND ORDERED THAT THE

PUTATIVE ERISA CLASS ACTIONS BE SEPARATELY

CONSOLIDATED. THE COURT ALSO APPOINTED LEAD

PLAINTIFFS AND LEAD PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IN BOTH

CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS AND APPOINTED LEAD PLAINTIFFS

LITIGATION.

THE NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE OF THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICES ANTITRUST DIVISION AND THE

PHILADELPHIA OFFICE OF THE SEC HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING

PARALLEL INVESTIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND BEAR

STEARNS FOR POSSIBLE ANTITRUST AND SECURITIES

VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING OR SALE

OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND DERIVATIVES

TO MUNICIPAL ISSUERS. THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THE

INVESTIGATIONS TO DATE HAS BEEN THE PERIOD 2001 TO

PRACTICES. ON FEBRUARY 10, 2009, THE COURT IN THE

FEDERAL-FILED ACTION ORDERED THAT THE FDIC BE

SUBSTITUTED AS DEFENDANT FOR WASHINGTON MUTUAL

BANK. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2009, THE FDIC MOVED TO

DISMISS IT FROM THE FEDERAL-FILED ACTION WITHOUT

BEGINNING IN MARCH 2008, SEVERAL

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS OF

A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE

FIRM, CONCERNING POSSIBLE STATE AND FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

SALE OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THE MARKET FOR

MANY SUCH SECURITIES HAD FROZEN AND A SIGNIFICANT

NUMBER OF AUCTIONS FOR THOSE SECURITIES BEGAN TO

REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA), THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, THE STATE OF FLORIDA

OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION, ON BEHALF OF THE

NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES

ADMINISTRATORS

ASSOCIATION (NASAA), AND THE

MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HAVE EITHER

REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM JPMORGAN CHASE OR ISSUED

SUBPOENAS TO JPMORGAN CHASE REGARDING THE

ACTIVITIES OF ITS AFFILIATES WITH RESPECT TO

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES.

ON AUGUST 13, 2008, THE FIRM, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF

AND AFFILIATES, AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE

WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE WHICH

PROVIDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE FIRM WOULD

OFFER TO PURCHASE AT PAR CERTAIN AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES PURCHASED FROM JPMORGAN SECURITIES,

CHASE INVESTMENT SERVICES CORP. AND BEAR, STEARNS &

CO. INC. BY INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, CHARITIES, AND

SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WITH ACCOUNT

VALUES OF UP TO $10 MILLION NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER

12, 2008. ON AUGUST 14, 2008, THE FIRM AGREED TO A

SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH

THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF

FLORIDA AND NASAA TASK FORCE, WHICH AGREED

TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT TO ALL

REMAINING STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN

ISLANDS. THE AGREEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE PROVIDE FOR

THE PAYMENT OF PENALTIES TOTALING $25 MILLION TO

NEW YORK AND THE OTHER STATES.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

NEGOTIATING FINAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTATION WITH

THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND THE

OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF

CONTINUE TO COOPERATE, WITH THE ONGOING SECS

INVESTIGATION.

FINRA INTO AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES PRACTICES OF

WAMU INVESTMENTS INC., A FORMER WASHINGTON MUTUAL

BANK SUBSIDIARY ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. WAMU INVESTMENTS,

INC. RESOLVED THE MATTER BY SUBMITTING A LETTER OF

ACCEPTANCE, WAIVER AND CONSENT TO FINRA. WITHOUT

ADMITTING OR DENYING THE FINDINGS, WAMU

INVESTMENTS, INC. CONSENTED TO FINDINGS BY FINRA

THAT IT VIOLATED CERTAIN NASD RULES RELATING TO

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC AND SUPERVISORY

PROCEDURES AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AGREED TO OFFER

TO PURCHASE AT PAR AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES

PURCHASED BY CERTAIN WAMU INVESTMENTS, INC.

THE FIRM IS THE SUBJECT OF TWO PUTATIVE SECURITIES

CLASS ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND A NUMBER

OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO

THE FIRMS SALES OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. EACH

COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MARKETED

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES AS SAFE, LIQUID, SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ALTHOUGH IT KNEW THAT AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES WERE LONG-DATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE

COMPLAINTS ALSO ALLEGE THAT JPMORGAN CHASE AND

OTHER BROKER-DEALERS ARTIFICIALLY SUPPORTED THE

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES MARKET AND THAT JPMORGAN CHASE KNEW

THAT THE MARKET WOULD BECOME ILLIQUID IF THE FIRMS

STOPPED SUPPORTING THE AUCTIONS BUT DID NOT

DISCLOSE THIS FACT TO INVESTORS. EACH OF THE NAMED

PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS ACCEPTED JPMORGAN

CHASES BUY-BACK OFFER AS PART OF ITS SETTLEMENT

WITH THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND NO LONGER OWNS ANY

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. JUDGE BERMAN OF THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK CONSOLIDATED THE TWO PUTATIVE SECURITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED A

JOINT MOTION TO DISMISS BOTH ACTIONS. PLAINTIFFS

OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION IS DUE ON MARCH 19, 2009.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES,  PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE,  JPMORGAN CHASE AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR

OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL

ACTIONS,  INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW

OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY

OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR

INDETERMINATE DAMAGES,  OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT

NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES,  INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL

OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE,  WHAT THE

TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS

WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS,  FINES,  PENALTIES

OR IMPACT RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE.

JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES,  BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE,  AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND

AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION

RESERVES,  THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS,

PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING

AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION. HOWEVER,  IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES

INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS,  ACTIONS AND

INVESTIGATIONS,  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY ACCRUED

BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT,  THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN

CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD,

DEPENDING ON,  AMONG OTHER FACTORS,  THE SIZE OF THE

LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN

CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM

TIME TO TIME,  AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES  OR EVEN MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES  IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE

FUTURE. SEE PAGE 116 FOR MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THERE

WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F)

INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR

STEARNS) ON MAY 30,

2008, AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL

BANK (WASHINGTON MUTUAL) ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008.

THE DECLINE IN NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS THE

RESULT OF A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, REFLECTING THE ADDITION OF $13.7

BILLION TO THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN

2008; A DECLINE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE DRIVEN BY OVER

$10 BILLION OF MARKDOWNS ON MORTGAGE-RELATED

POSITIONS AND LEVERAGED LENDING EXPOSURES IN THE

INVESTMENT BANK; AND AN INCREASE IN TOTAL

NONINTEREST EXPENSE DUE

TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION AND THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES

FIRMS WAS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING IN 2008. THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY SLOWED, WITH MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE

U.S., SLIPPING INTO RECESSION. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

WORSENED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AMID A NUMBER OF

UNPRECEDENTED DEVELOPMENTS THAT UNDERMINED THE

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND ERODED CONFIDENCE IN GLOBAL

FINANCIAL MARKETS. JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED BEAR

STEARNS THROUGH A MERGER CONSUMMATED

IN MAY AND ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) IN SEPTEMBER. THE

U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLACED THE FEDERAL HOME

LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC) AND THE

FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FANNIE

MAE) UNDER ITS CONTROL. LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS

INC. DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. THE BANK OF AMERICA

CORPORATION ACQUIRED MERRILL LYNCH & CO., INC. AND

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY ACQUIRED WACHOVIA

CORPORATION. THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED A LOAN TO

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. (AIG) IN

EXCHANGE FOR AN EQUITY INTEREST IN AIG TO PREVENT

THE INSURERS FAILURE. MORGAN STANLEY, THE GOLDMAN

SACHS GROUP, INC., GMAC, AMERICAN EXPRESS, DISCOVER

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CIT GROUP RECEIVED APPROVAL

FROM THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) TO BECOME FEDERAL

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. IN OTHER INDUSTRIES,

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROVIDED TEMPORARY LOANS TO GENERAL

MOTORS CORPORATION AND CHRYSLER LLC.

THESE EVENTS ACCOMPANIED SEVERE STRAINS IN TERM

FUNDING MARKETS, REFLECTING HEIGHTENED CONCERNS

ABOUT COUNTERPARTY RISK. AS A RESULT, LIBOR RATES

ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FALL, DESPITE A ROUND OF

COORDINATED RATE CUTS BY A NUMBER OF CENTRAL BANKS.

BY YEAR-END, LIBOR RATES EASED IN RESPONSE TO

PROPOSALS TO INSURE DEPOSITS AND SELECTED DEBT OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE TURMOIL IN FINANCIAL

MARKETS DURING 2008 LED TO TIGHTER CREDIT

CONDITIONS AND DIMINISHED LIQUIDITY, CAUSING

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD TO BECOME

MORE CAUTIOUS AND CURTAIL SPENDING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTRACTED

SHARPLY, 2.8 MILLION JOBS WERE LOST IN 2008, AND

THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY, TO

7.2% BY YEAR-END.

THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTION LED

THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO REDUCE ITS TARGET OVERNIGHT

INTEREST RATES TO NEAR ZERO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, CAPPING OFF A YEAR OF NEAR-CONTINUOUS RATE

REDUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURY (THE U.S. TREASURY), THE FEDERAL RESERVE

AND THE FDIC, WORKING IN COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING THE

BANK OF ENGLAND, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AND THE

SWISS NATIONAL BANK, BEGAN, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, TO TAKE A VARIETY OF EXTRAORDINARY

MEASURES DESIGNED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND STRENGTHEN FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CAPITAL INJECTIONS,

GUARANTEES OF BANK LIABILITIES AND THE ACQUISITION

OF ILLIQUID ASSETS FROM BANKS. IN PARTICULAR, ON

OCTOBER 3, 2008, THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC

STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 (THE EESA) WAS SIGNED

INTO LAW. PURSUANT TO THE EESA, THE U.S. TREASURY

HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE A RANGE OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ACTIONS TO STABILIZE AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO

THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE

BY THE U.S. TREASURY OF CERTAIN TROUBLED ASSETS

FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (THE TROUBLED ASSET

RELIEF PROGRAM) AND THE DIRECT PURCHASE BY THE

U.S. TREASURY OF EQUITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

(THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM).

THE EFFORTS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUE IN

2009, WITH INITIATIVES INCLUDING A FISCAL STIMULUS

BILL, THE AMERICAN REINVESTMENT AND RECOVERY ACT OF

2009, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT BARACK

OBAMA ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009. ALSO IN FEBRUARY,

THE U.S. TREASURY OUTLINED A

PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND PRESIDENT OBAMA PROPOSED A

PLAN TO HELP DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WORKING

WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY AGENCIES, HAS

ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS TO

PROMOTE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE CREDIT

MARKETS AND REINTRODUCE LIQUIDITY TO THE FINANCIAL

SYSTEM. SUCH

ACTIONS TAKEN BY U.S. REGULATORY AGENCIES INCLUDE

THE INTRODUCTION OF PROGRAMS TO RESTORE LIQUIDITY

TO MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET, AND OTHER FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, THE FDIC ISSUED A TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE

PROGRAM (THE TLG PROGRAM) FOR THE SENIOR DEBT OF ALL FDIC-INSURED

INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS DEPOSITS IN

NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS.

DESPITE THE DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND

OVERALL DROP IN EARNINGS, JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED

A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND PRODUCED UNDERLYING

GROWTH IN MANY BUSINESS AREAS. THE TIER 1 CAPITAL

RATIO WAS 10.9% AT YEAR-END; TREASURY & SECURITIES

SERVICES AND

COMMERCIAL BANKING EACH REPORTED RECORD REVENUE AND

NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR; THE

CONSUMER BUSINESSES OPENED MILLIONS OF NEW CHECKING

AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS; ASSET MANAGEMENT

EXPERIENCED RECORD NET INFLOWS IN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT; AND THE INVESTMENT BANK GAINED MARKET

SHARE IN ALL MAJOR FEE CATEGORIES. THE DIVERSIFIED

NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND ITS STRONG

CAPITAL POSITION ENABLED IT TO WEATHER THE

RECESSIONARY ENVIRONMENT DURING 2008.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN

HELPING TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. IT

ASSUMED THE RISK AND EXPENDED THE NECESSARY

RESOURCES TO ACQUIRE BEAR STEARNS AND THE BANKING

OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL. IN OCTOBER 2008,

THE FIRM AGREED TO ACCEPT A $25 BILLION CAPITAL

INVESTMENT BY THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS CONTINUED TO LEND TO CLIENTS IN A SAFE AND SOUND

MANNER AND TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO MULTIPLE

FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED

PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PREVENTED MORE THAN 300,000

FORECLOSURES, WITH PLANS TO HELP MORE THAN 400,000

MORE FAMILIES KEEP THEIR HOMES THROUGH CHASE-OWNED

MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE

FIRM HAS EXPANDED THIS EFFORT TO INCLUDE OVER $1.1

TRILLION OF INVESTOR-OWNED MORTGAGES.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE

PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH

THE PRIOR YEAR, AND DISCUSSES RESULTS ON A MANAGED

BASIS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. FOR MORE INFORMATION

ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND

RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 3839 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

INVESTMENT BANK

REPORTED A NET LOSS FOR THE YEAR,

COMPARED WITH NET INCOME IN 2007. THE SIGNIFICANT

DECLINE IN RESULTS REFLECTED LOWER TOTAL NET

REVENUE, A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND

HIGHER TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. MARKDOWNS OF OVER

$10 BILLION ON MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS AND

LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS

DROVE FIXED INCOME TRADING REVENUE LOWER;

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND EQUITY TRADING REVENUE

DECLINED AS WELL. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY

RECORD PERFORMANCE IN RATES AND CURRENCIES, CREDIT

TRADING, COMMODITIES AND EMERGING MARKETS, AS WELL

AS STRONG EQUITY CLIENT REVENUE, AND GAINS FROM THE

WIDENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN

STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES. THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ROSE FROM THE 2007

LEVEL, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING A HIGHER ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DRIVEN BY A WEAKENING CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSFER

OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM

HELD-FOR-SALE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. THE

INCREASE IN TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS LARGELY

DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL EXPENSE RELATING TO THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. IN

ADDITION, IB BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES ON OVERSEAS EARNINGS.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

NET INCOME DECLINED,

REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY POSITIVE

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSR) RISK MANAGEMENT

RESULTS AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION. ADDITIONAL DRIVERS OF REVENUE

GROWTH INCLUDED WIDER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS AND

HIGHER LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED AS HOUSING PRICE DECLINES

HAVE CONTINUED TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

IN ESTIMATED LOSSES, PARTICULARLY FOR HIGH

LOAN-TO-VALUE HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE LOANS. THE

PROVISION WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN

ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THE AUTO, STUDENT AND BUSINESS

BANKING LOAN PORTFOLIOS. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE

ROSE FROM THE 2007 LEVEL, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER MORTGAGE

REINSURANCE LOSSES, INCREASED MORTGAGE SERVICING

EXPENSE AND INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK.

CARD SERVICES

NET INCOME DECLINED, DRIVEN BY A

HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY HIGHER MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE. THE GROWTH IN

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT

OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER

AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, WIDER LOAN SPREADS

AND INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, OFF-SET

PREDOMINANTLY BY INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE AND

HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, AS WELL

AS THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS

ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. THE MANAGED

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE ROSE FROM LAST YEAR,

LARGELY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

NET INCOME INCREASED, SURPASSING

THE RECORD LEVEL POSTED IN 2007. THE RESULTS WERE

DRIVEN BY RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY

DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND LOAN BALANCES,

THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LENDING-RELATED FEES, AND

INCREASES IN OTHER FEE

30

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME. THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPREAD

COMPRESSION IN THE LIABILITY AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

THE INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

REFLECTED A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND GROWTH

IN LOAN BALANCES. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE

DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO LOWER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND

VOLUME-BASED CHARGES FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS,

PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES

NET INCOME INCREASED

OVER THE RECORD LEVEL SET IN 2007, DRIVEN BY RECORD

TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

NONINTEREST EXPENSE. WORLDWIDE SECURITIES SERVICES

POSTED RECORD NET REVENUE, DRIVEN BY WIDER SPREADS

IN SECURITIES LENDING, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

LIABILITY PRODUCTS, INCREASED

PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS, AND

HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES. THESE BENEFITS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET DEPRECIATION. TREASURY

SERVICES POSTED RECORD NET REVENUE, REFLECTING

HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES AND VOLUME GROWTH IN

ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER PRODUCTS AND TRADE LOANS.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED, REFLECTING

HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO BUSINESS AND VOLUME

GROWTH, AS WELL AS CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN NEW

PRODUCT PLATFORMS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME DECREASED, DRIVEN BY

LOWER TOTAL NET REVENUE, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE

WAS DUE TO LOWER PERFORMANCE FEES AND THE EFFECT OF

LOWER MARKETS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LOWER MARKET

VALUATIONS OF SEED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE REVENUE DECLINES WERE HIGHER

DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES, THE BENEFIT OF THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER, INCREASED REVENUE FROM NET ASSET

INFLOWS AND WIDER DEPOSIT SPREADS. THE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOAN BALANCES, HIGHER NET

CHARGE-OFFS AND A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECLINED COMPARED WITH

2007, DRIVEN BY LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF THE

BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RESULTING FROM INCREASED AVERAGE HEADCOUNT.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

NET INCOME DECLINED FROM

THE 2007 LEVEL AND INCLUDED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN

RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND A

CONFORMING LOAN LOSS PROVISION. EXCLUDING THESE

ITEMS, THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY PRIVATE EQUITY LOSSES IN 2008,

COMPARED WITH GAINS IN 2007, LOSSES ON PREFERRED

SECURITIES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, AND A

CHARGE RELATED TO THE OFFER TO REPURCHASE

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES. THESE DECLINES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND A

GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE AND THE GAIN FROM THE SALE

OF MASTERCARD SHARES. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL

NONINTEREST EXPENSE REFLECTED A REDUCTION OF CREDIT

CARD-RELATED LITIGATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY HIGHER MERGER COSTS.

THE FIRMS MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$24.6 BILLION FOR 2008, COMPARED WITH $9.2 BILLION

FOR 2007. THE TOTAL CONSUMER-MANAGED PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS $21.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $8.3

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING INCREASES IN

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HOME

EQUITY, MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD LOANS, AS WELL AS

HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS. CONSUMER-MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFFS WERE $13.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $6.8

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

RESULTING IN MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATES OF 3.06%

AND 1.97%, RESPECTIVELY. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $3.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$934 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTING THE

EFFECT OF A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND LOAN

GROWTH. WHOLESALE NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $402

MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $72

MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING IN NET

CHARGE-OFF RATES

OF 0.18% AND 0.04%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM HAD

TOTAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS OF $12.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, UP FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR LEVEL OF

$3.9 BILLION.

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

WAS $166.9 BILLION, AND THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO

WAS 10.9%. DURING 2008, THE FIRM RAISED $11.5

BILLION OF COMMON EQUITY AND $32.8 BILLION OF

PREFERRED EQUITY, INCLUDING A WARRANT ISSUED TO THE

U.S. TREASURY.

2009 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

BASED UPON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET

FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN

CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2009 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP

OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S. ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY,

THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT

ACTIVITY LEVELS. EACH OF THESE LINKED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, AS A

RESULT OF RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND EVENTS, CONGRESS AND

REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON THE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. THE FIRMS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR THE GLOBAL

AND U.S. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS TO WEAKEN FURTHER AND POTENTIALLY

FASTER, CAPITAL MARKETS TO REMAIN UNDER STRESS, FOR THERE TO BE A

CONTINUED DECLINE IN U.S. HOUSING PRICES, AND FOR CONGRESS AND

REGULATORS TO CONTINUE TO ADOPT LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT

COULD LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, OR IMPOSE

ADDITIONAL COSTS UPON THE FIRM IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH SUCH NEW LAWS

OR RULES. THESE FACTORS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT

THE FIRMS REVENUE, CREDIT COSTS, OVERALL BUSINESS VOLUMES AND

EARNINGS.

GIVEN THE POTENTIAL

STRESS ON THE CONSUMER FROM RISING UNEMPLOYMENT,

THE CONTINUED DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOUSING PRICES

AND THE ELEVATED NATIONAL INVENTORY OF UNSOLD

HOMES, MANAGEMENT REMAINS EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WITH

RESPECT TO THE CREDIT OUTLOOK FOR HOME EQUITY,

MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CONTINUED DETERIORATION

IN CREDIT TRENDS FOR THE HOME EQUITY, MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS, WHICH

WILL LIKELY REQUIRE ADDITIONS TO THE CONSUMER LOAN

LOSS ALLOWANCE IN 2009 OR BEYOND. ECONOMIC DATA RELEASED IN EARLY 2009 INDICATED

THAT HOUSING PRICES AND THE LABOR MARKET HAVE WEAKENED FURTHER SINCE

YEAR-END, AND THAT DETERIORATION COULD CONTINUE INTO LATE 2009.

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK,

QUARTERLY NET CHARGE-OFFS COULD, OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

QUARTERS, REACH $1.0 BILLION TO $1.4 BILLION FOR THE HOME EQUITY

PORTFOLIO, $375 MILLION TO $475 MILLION FOR THE PRIME MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIO, AND $375 MILLION TO $475 MILLION FOR THE

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE

MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR CARD SERVICES

(EXCLUDING THE IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING

OPERATIONS) TO APPROACH 7% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009 AND LIKELY HIGHER BY THE END OF

THE YEAR DEPENDING ON UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS. THESE CHARGE-OFF RATES COULD INCREASE

EVEN FURTHER IF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES

TO DETERIORATE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FURTHER THAN MANAGEMENTS CURRENT

EXPECTATIONS. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS ARE LIKELY TO

INCREASE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF THE

DETERIORATION IN UNDERLYING CREDIT CONDITIONS.

WHOLESALE NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2008 INCREASED FROM

HISTORIC LOWS IN 2007 AND ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE

MATERIALLY IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF INCREASING

WEAKNESS IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

THE INVESTMENT BANK CONTINUES TO BE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY THE DISRUPTION IN THE CREDIT AND

MORTGAGE MARKETS, AS WELL AS BY OVERALL LOWER

LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY. THE CONTINUATION OF THESE

FACTORS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO REDUCED LEVELS OF

CLIENT ACTIVITY, LOWER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND

LOWER TRADING REVENUE. IN ADDITION, IF THE FIRMS

OWN CREDIT SPREADS TIGHTEN, AS THEY DID IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN TRADING LIABILITIES WOULD ALSO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS. THE FIRM HELD

$12.6 BILLION (GROSS NOTIONAL) OF LEGACY LEVERAGED

LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS AS HELD-FOR-SALE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. MARKDOWNS AVERAGING 45% OF

THE GROSS NOTIONAL VALUE HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON THESE

LEGACY POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESULTING

IN A NET CARRYING VALUE OF $6.9 BILLION. LEVERAGED

LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO

HEDGE EFFECTIVELY, AND IF MARKET CONDITIONS FURTHER

DETERIORATE, ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS MAY BE NECESSARY

ON THIS ASSET CLASS. THE INVESTMENT BANK ALSO HELD,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN AGGREGATE $6.1 BILLION OF

PRIME AND ALT-A MORTGAGE EXPOSURE, WHICH IS ALSO

DIFFICULT TO HEDGE EFFECTIVELY, AND $875 MILLION OF

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, THE

INVESTMENT BANK HAD $7.7 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE EXPOSURE. IN SPITE OF ACTIVE HEDGING,

MORTGAGE EXPOSURES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

WORSENING MARKET CONDITIONS AND FURTHER DETERIORATION

IN THE HOUSING MARKET. THE COMBINATION OF CREDIT

COSTS AND ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS ON THE VARIOUS EXPOSURES NOTED ABOVE

COULD REACH OR EXCEED $2.0 BILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

EARNINGS IN COMMERCIAL BANKING AND TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES COULD DECLINE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TIGHTER

SPREADS IN THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT OR A DECLINE IN THE LEVEL OF LIABILITY BALANCES. EARNINGS IN

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT

WILL LIKELY DETERIORATE IF MARKET LEVELS CONTINUE

TO DECLINE, DUE TO REDUCED LEVELS OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND CUSTODY. EARNINGS IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE

EQUITY SEGMENT COULD BE MORE VOLATILE DUE TO

INCREASES IN THE SIZE OF THE FIRMS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF

INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS

ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND AT

CURRENT MARKET LEVELS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF $400 MILLION OR MORE ARE LIKELY IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

ASSUMING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DO NOT WORSEN BEYOND MANAGEMENTS CURRENT

EXPECTATIONS, MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE NET INCOME

IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS

BANKING OPERATIONS COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $0.50 PER

SHARE IN 2009; THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER COULD CONTRIBUTE $1

BILLION (AFTER-TAX) ANNUALIZED AFTER 2009; AND MERGER-RELATED ITEMS, WHICH INCLUDE BOTH THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER, COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION

(AFTER-TAX) IN 2009.

RECENT

DEVELOPMENTS

ON

FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE

FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER

SHARE, EFFECTIVE FOR THE DIVIDEND PAYABLE APRIL 30, 2009 TO

SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009. THE ACTION WILL ENABLE

THE FIRM TO RETAIN AN ADDITIONAL $5.0 BILLION IN COMMON EQUITY PER

YEAR. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN THE DIVIDEND AT THIS LEVEL FOR THE

TIME BEING. THE ACTION WAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE

FIRMS BALANCE SHEET RETAINED THE CAPITAL STRENGTH NECESSARY TO

WEATHER A FURTHER DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE FIRM INTENDS TO

RETURN TO A MORE NORMALIZED DIVIDEND PAYOUT AS SOON AS FEASIBLE AFTER

THE ENVIRONMENT HAS STABILIZED.

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING

OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK. ON MAY 30, 2008, THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER WAS CONSUMMATED. EACH OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE AND THEIR RESPECTIVE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS FROM EACH

RESPECTIVE TRANSACTION DATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 123-128 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $67.3 BILLION WAS DOWN $4.1

BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE

RESULTED FROM THE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN 2008.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY AND INCLUDED NET MARKDOWNS ON

MORTGAGE-RELATED POSITIONS AND LEVERAGED LENDING

FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS, LOSSES ON

PREFERRED SECURITIES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC,

AND LOSSES ON PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE

WERE OTHER LOSSES AND MARKDOWNS RECORDED IN OTHER

INCOME, INCLUDING THE

FIRMS SHARE OF BEAR STEARNS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8

TO MAY 30, 2008. THESE DECLINES WERE LARGELY OFFSET

BY HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME, PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING,

AND THE GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE DOWN FROM THE RECORD

LEVEL OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO LOWER DEBT

UNDERWRITING FEES, AS WELL AS LOWER ADVISORY AND

EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE AT

RECORD LEVELS IN 2007. THESE DECLINES WERE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED MARKET ACTIVITY. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES,

WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE IB SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 4244 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN 2008, PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, WHICH

CONSISTS OF REVENUE FROM THE FIRMS TRADING AND

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, DECLINED BY

$19.7 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TRADING REVENUE

DECREASED $14.5 BILLION TO A NEGATIVE $9.8 BILLION

COMPARED WITH A POSITIVE $4.7 BILLION IN 2007. THE

DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY

HIGHER NET MARKDOWNS OF $5.9 BILLION ON MORTGAGE-

RELATED EXPOSURES COMPARED WITH $1.4 BILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR; HIGHER NET MARKDOWNS OF $4.7 BILLION ON

LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS

COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR;

LOSSES OF $1.1 BILLION ON PREFERRED SECURITIES OF

FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC; AND WEAKER EQUITY

TRADING RESULTS COMPARED WITH A RECORD LEVEL IN

2007. IN ADDITION, TRADING REVENUE WAS ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE WERE

RECORD RESULTS IN RATES AND CURRENCIES, CREDIT

TRADING, COMMODITIES AND EMERGING MARKETS, AS WELL

AS STRONG EQUITY CLIENT REVENUE ACROSS PRODUCTS AND

TOTAL GAINS OF $2.0 BILLION FROM THE WIDENING OF

THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED

LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES, COMPARED WITH $1.3

BILLION IN 2007. PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS ALSO

DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

SWINGING TO LOSSES OF $908 MILLION IN 2008 FROM

GAINS OF $4.3 BILLION IN 2007. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 INCLUDED A FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157. FOR

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE, SEE IB AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4244 AND 6163,

RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES 146148 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY RESULTING FROM HIGHER

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND THE IMPACT OF THE

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4550, THE TSS SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 5657, AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS

ON PAGES 5455 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DECLINE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND

COMMISSIONS REVENUE COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS DRIVEN

BY LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM DUE TO LOWER

PERFORMANCE FEES AND THE EFFECT OF LOWER MARKETS ON

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS REVENUE RELATED

PREDOMINANTLY TO HIGHER BROKERAGE TRANSACTION

VOLUME WITHIN IBS EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE, WHICH

INCLUDED ADDITIONS FROM BEAR STEARNS PRIME

SERVICES BUSINESS; AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATION FEES

IN TSS DRIVEN BY WIDER SPREADS IN SECURITIES

LENDING AND INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND

EXISTING CLIENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON PAGES 4244, RFS ON PAGES

4550, TSS ON PAGES 5657, AND AM ON PAGES 5860

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES GAINS COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO THE REPOSITIONING OF THE

CORPORATE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AS A

RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AS PART OF MANAGING

THE STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK OF THE FIRM, AND

HIGHER GAINS FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, WHICH

ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN THE FIRMS CORPORATE

BUSINESS, SEE THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 6163 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET MORTGAGE SERVICING

REVENUE, WHICH BENEFITED FROM AN IMPROVEMENT IN MSR

RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND INCREASED LOAN

SERVICING REVENUE. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE

INCREASED SLIGHTLY, AS THE IMPACT OF GROWTH IN

ORIGINATIONS WAS PREDOMINANTLY

FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS RECORDED

PRIMARILY IN RFS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS, SEE

THE CONSUMER LENDING DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4750 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME ROSE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME DUE TO

HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME IN CS AND HIGHER

DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION VOLUME IN RFS, THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, AND INCREASED

SERVICING FEES RESULTING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES. THESE RESULTS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN VOLUME-DRIVEN

PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS AND EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARDS

PROGRAMS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD

INCOME, SEE CS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5153 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR, DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALE OF VISA SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

OF $1.5 BILLION, THE GAIN ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT VENTURE OF $1.0

BILLION, AND GAINS ON SALES OF CERTAIN OTHER

ASSETS. THESE PROCEEDS AND GAINS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY MARKDOWNS ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING SEED CAPITAL IN AM; A $464 MILLION CHARGE

RELATED TO THE OFFER TO REPURCHASE AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES AT PAR; LOSSES OF $423 MILLION

REFLECTING THE FIRMS 49.4% OWNERSHIP IN BEAR

STEARNS LOSSES FROM

APRIL 8 TO MAY 30, 2008; AND LOWER SECURITIZATION

INCOME AT CS.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE

PREDOMINANTLY TO THE FOLLOWING: HIGHER

TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME IN IB, THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WIDER

NET INTEREST SPREAD IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY,

GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND DEPOSIT BALANCES IN THE

WHOLESALE AND RFS BUSINESSES, HIGHER CONSUMER AND

WHOLESALE LOAN BALANCES, AND WIDER SPREADS ON

CONSUMER LOANS IN RFS. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS FOR 2008 WERE $1.4

TRILLION, UP 23% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

HIGHER LOANS, AFS SECURITIES, SECURITIES BORROWED,

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER INTEREST-EARNING

ASSETS BALANCES. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE

INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES FOR 2008 WERE $1.3

TRILLION, UP 24% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY

HIGHER DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT, BROKERAGE PAYABLES

AND OTHER BORROWINGS BALANCES. THE NET INTEREST

YIELD ON THE FIRMS INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, ON A

FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.87%, AN

INCREASE OF 48 BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $71.4 BILLION WAS UP $9.4

BILLION, OR 15%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER NET

INTEREST INCOME, VERY STRONG PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS,

RECORD ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND

COMMISSIONS REVENUE, HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND

RELATED INCOME, AND RECORD INVESTMENT BANKING FEES

CONTRIBUTED TO THE REVENUE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES

WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER TRADING REVENUE.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES GREW IN 2007 TO A LEVEL

HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS RECORD SET IN 2006. RECORD

ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES DROVE THE

RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT

UNDERWRITING FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY

RECORDED IN IB, SEE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

4244 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE CONSISTS OF TRADING

REVENUE AND PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS. TRADING REVENUE

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE 2006 LEVEL,

PRIMARILY DUE TO NET MARKDOWNS IN IB OF $1.4

BILLION ON SUB-PRIME POSITIONS, INCLUDING SUBPRIME

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS), AND $1.3

BILLION ON LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED LOANS AND

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. ALSO IN IB, MARKDOWNS OF

SECURITIZED PRODUCTS RELATED TO NONSUBPRIME

MORTGAGES AND WEAK CREDIT TRADING PERFORMANCE MORE

THAN OFFSET RECORD REVENUE IN CURRENCIES AND STRONG

REVENUE IN BOTH RATES AND EQUITIES. EQUITIES

BENEFITED FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY AND RECORD

TRADING RESULTS ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS. IBS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO RESULTS INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUE FROM RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN PRIVATE

EQUITY GAINS FROM 2006 REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER LEVEL OF GAINS, THE CLASSIFICATION OF

CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY CARRIED INTEREST AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND A FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 ON NONPUBLIC PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 157 (FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE

IB AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 4244 AND 6163, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 6

ON PAGES 146148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE FROM THE 2006

LEVEL, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED

FEES AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED

FEES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB,

SEE THE RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4550, THE

TSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5657, AND THE CB

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5455 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS

REVENUE REACHED A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS

RECORD SET IN 2006. INCREASED ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT

FEES IN AM DROVE THE RECORD RESULTS. THE 18% GROWTH

IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT FROM YEAR-END 2006 CAME

FROM NET ASSET INFLOWS AND MARKET APPRECIATION

ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS: INSTITUTIONAL, RETAIL, PRIVATE

BANK AND PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT. TSS ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE, DRIVEN BY

INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS

AND MARKET APPRECIATION ON ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY.

FINALLY, COMMISSIONS REVENUE INCREASED, DUE MAINLY

TO HIGHER BROKERAGE TRANSACTION VOLUME (PRIMARILY

INCLUDED WITHIN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS

REVENUE OF IB), WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE SALE OF

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS BY RFS IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2006 AND A CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007

RESULTING FROM ACCELERATED SURRENDERS OF CUSTOMER

ANNUITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES

AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB

ON PAGES 4244, RFS ON PAGES 4550, TSS ON PAGES

5657, AND AM ON PAGES 5860 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE FAVORABLE VARIANCE RESULTING FROM SECURITIES

GAINS IN 2007 COMPARED WITH SECURITIES LOSSES IN

2006 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

RESULTS OF REPOSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE POSITIVE VARIANCE WAS A $234 MILLION GAIN

FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES), WHICH ARE

INCREASE IN MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND THE

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS

EXPENSE (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED

AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING RECORDED AS AN

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED

INCOME, WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFS

CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS, SEE THE CONSUMER LENDING

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4750 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED

FROM THE 2006 LEVEL, AS LOWER SERVICING FEES EARNED

IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH

WERE AFFECTED UNFAVORABLY BY HIGHER NET CREDIT

LOSSES AND NARROWER LOAN MARGINS, WERE OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN NET INTERCHANGE INCOME EARNED ON THE

FIRMS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE CS SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 5153 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN SALES AND

WORKOUTS, AND THE ABSENCE OF A $103 MILLION GAIN IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 RELATED TO THE SALE OF

MASTERCARD SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING. (THE 2007 GAIN ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD

SHARES WAS RECORDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) AS

THE SHARES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE AFS PORTFOLIO

SUBSEQUENT TO THE IPO.) INCREASED INCOME FROM

AUTOMOBILE OPERATING LEASES AND HIGHER GAINS ON THE

SALE OF LEVERAGED LEASES AND STUDENT LOANS

PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINE.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING: HIGHER

TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME, DUE TO A SHIFT

OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE (RELATED TO CERTAIN IB STRUCTURED NOTES TO

WHICH FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING WAS ELECTED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159); GROWTH IN

LIABILITY AND DEPOSIT BALANCES IN THE WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER BUSINESSES; A HIGHER LEVEL OF CREDIT CARD

LOANS; THE IMPACT OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION; AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN CORPORATES NET

INTEREST SPREAD. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS FOR 2007 WERE $1.1

TRILLION, UP 12% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ASSETS 

DEBT INSTRUMENTS, LOANS, AND AFS

SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF

THE RESTRUCTURING AND DECONSOLIDATION DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 OF CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS THAT THE FIRM ADMINISTERED. THE NET

INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE

EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.39%, AN INCREASE OF 23 BASIS

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2008 ROSE BY

$14.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO

INCREASES IN BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE

PROVISIONS. THE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION

REFLECTED HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR HOME EQUITY

AND MORTGAGES RESULTING FROM DECLINING HOUSING

PRICES; AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THE

AUTO, STUDENT AND BUSINESS BANKING LOAN

PORTFOLIOS; AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES AND HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS OF CREDIT CARD

LOANS. THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS

DRIVEN BY A HIGHER ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM A

WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND GROWTH IN RETAINED

LOANS. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2008 ALSO INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSFER OF

$4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM

HELD-FOR-SALE. IN ADDITION, IN 2008 BOTH THE CONSUMER

AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS WERE AFFECTED BY A $1.5

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO THE FIRMS LOAN LOSS

METHODOLOGIES. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE

LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2007 ROSE $3.6

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASES IN

BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS. THE

INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION FROM THE PRIOR

OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS FROM EACH

RESPECTIVE TRANSACTION DATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 123-128 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2008 WAS $43.5

BILLION, UP $1.8 BILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE ADDITIONAL

OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION AND BEAR STEARNS MERGER, AND INVESTMENTS

IN THE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN

THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, LARGELY OFFSET BY

LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT

OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE

DECREASED DUE TO A NET REDUCTION IN OTHER EXPENSE

RELATED TO LITIGATION; LOWER CREDIT CARD AND

CONSUMER LENDING MARKETING EXPENSE; AND A DECREASE

IN THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AS CERTAIN

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS WERE FULLY

AMORTIZED IN 2007 AND THE AMORTIZATION RATE FOR

CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES DECLINED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE. THESE DECREASES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY INCREASES IN PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES, DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN NEW

PRODUCT PLATFORMS IN TSS, BUSINESS AND VOLUME GROWTH

IN CS CREDIT CARD PROCESSING AND IB

BROKERAGE, CLEARING AND EXCHANGE TRANSACTION

PROCESSING. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASES WERE

AN INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE DUE TO HIGHER MORTGAGE

REINSURANCE LOSSES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING EXPENSE

DUE TO INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND

DEFAULTS IN RFS; AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE

REFLECTING HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED

AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES IN RFS, AND

OTHER TECHNOLOGY-RELATED INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE

BUSINESSES; AND, AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE

PARTLY FOR THE EXPANSION OF RFS RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, REFER TO NOTE 18 ON

FOR INFORMATION ON MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 11

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2007 WAS $41.7

BILLION, UP $2.9 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS

ACROSS THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM 2006 WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INVESTMENTS AND

ACQUISITIONS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION; THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRIVATE

EQUITY CARRIED INTEREST FROM PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE; THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN

LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS

PREVIOUSLY NETTED AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING

RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007 DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159); AND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE INCREASES WERE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES AND

CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM 2006 DUE TO

HIGHER PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES PRIMARILY

REFLECTING HIGHER BROKERAGE EXPENSE AND CREDIT CARD

PROCESSING COSTS RESULTING FROM GROWTH IN

TRANSACTION VOLUME, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN THE

BUSINESSES AND ACQUISITIONS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO

THE INCREASE WAS HIGHER OTHER EXPENSE DUE TO

INCREASED NET LEGAL-RELATED COSTS, REFLECTING A

LOWER LEVEL OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND INCREASED

COSTS OF CREDIT CARD-RELATED LITIGATION, AND OTHER INCREASES

DRIVEN BY BUSINESS GROWTH AND INVESTMENTS IN THE

BUSINESSES. OTHER NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASES

ALSO INCLUDED HIGHER OCCUPANCY EXPENSE DRIVEN BY

ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, IN

PARTICULAR, THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE

BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION; AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY,

COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE DUE PRIMARILY

TO HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES

SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES IN RFS, AND OTHER

TECHNOLOGY-RELATED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES TO

SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY LOWER CREDIT CARD MARKETING

EXPENSE; DECREASES DUE TO THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE

BUSINESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2006 AND LOWER CREDIT CARD FRAUD-RELATED

LOSSES, BOTH IN OTHER EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, EXPENSE IN

GENERAL WAS REDUCED BY THE EFFECT OF CONTINUING

BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THESE TRANSACTIONS, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 123128 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2008

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS THE RESULT OF

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME COMBINED

WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO

U.S. FEDERAL TAXES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE

IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS INCREASED BUSINESS

TAX CREDITS AND THE REALIZATION OF A $1.1 BILLION

BENEFIT FROM THE RELEASE OF DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITIES. THESE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WERE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF

CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE

REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE DECREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

CHANGES IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, AND EQUITY LOSSES

REPRESENTING THE FIRMS 49.4% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

BEAR STEARNS LOSSES FROM APRIL 8 TO MAY

30, 2008, FOR WHICH NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS

RECORDED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INCOME

TAXES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE

FIRM ON PAGES 107111 AND NOTE 28 ON PAGES

197199 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2007, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME COMBINED

WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS THE

RECOGNITION IN 2006 OF $367 MILLION OF BENEFITS

RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX AUDITS.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AS A

RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION WITH THE BANK OF

NEW YORK ON OCTOBER 1, 2006, THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OF THE SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST

BUSINESSES (I.E., TRUSTEE, PAYING AGENT, LOAN AGENCY

AND DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES) WERE REPORTED AS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2006 WAS DUE

PREDOMINANTLY TO A GAIN OF $622 MILLION FROM

EXITING SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006. NO INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WAS RECORDED IN 2008 OR 2007.

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN

THE FIRM RECORDED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN OF $1.9

BILLION IN 2008 ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF

THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL. THE

TRANSACTION IS BEING ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS 141. THE ADJUSTED FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS OF

THE BANKING OPERATIONS, AFTER PURCHASE ACCOUNTING

ADJUSTMENTS, WAS HIGHER THAN JPMORGAN CHASES PURCHASE PRICE. THERE WERE NO EXTRAORDINARY GAINS

RECORDED IN 2007 OR 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

(U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON

PAGES 118216 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT

PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED

BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN

UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE

TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES

A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER

COMPANIES U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A

REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS

RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS ON

A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS

STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND

INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUME

CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY CS REMAIN ON THE

BALANCE

SHEET AND PRESENTS REVENUE ON A FULLY

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON NET INCOME

AS REPORTED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS OR BY THE

FIRM AS A WHOLE.

THE PRESENTATION OF CS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS

ASSUMES THAT CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

SECURITIZED AND SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 140

REMAIN ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THAT

THE EARNINGS ON THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE

CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE EARNINGS ON

RETAINED LOANS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED

BASIS TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND

ARE USED FOR BOTH LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AND SECURITIZED LOANS. ALTHOUGH

SECURITIZATIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS THE

ONGOING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS THE CUSTOMERS MAY

CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS; ACCORDINGLY, THE

CUSTOMERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE

SECURITIZED LOANS AND THE LOANS RETAINED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES

MANAGED BASIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO

INVESTORS, ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE

CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOANS REPORTED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE FIRMS

RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS. FOR A

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS RESULTS

FOR CS, SEE CS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5153 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

SECURITIZATION PROCESS, AND LOANS AND RESIDUAL

INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

168176 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON A FTE

BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS

IS PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS

COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS

MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE

ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT

SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED

TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX

EXPENSE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT

BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE

UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF

THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND THEREFORE

FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS

COMPETITORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE-OF-BUSINESS

BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL

BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF

CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN

WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED

BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS

ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS.

BUSINESS SEGMENT CHANGES

COMMENCING OCTOBER 1, 2008,RFS WAS REORGANIZED INTO

THE FOLLOWING TWO REPORTING SEGMENTS: RETAIL

BANKING AND CONSUMER LENDING. PREVIOUSLY, RFS

CONSISTED OF THREE REPORTING SEGMENTS: REGIONAL

BANKING, MORTGAGE BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE. THE NEW

RETAIL BANKING REPORTING SEGMENT NOW COMPRISES

CONSUMER BANKING AND BUSINESS BANKING ACTIVITIES,

WHICH PREVIOUSLY WERE REPORTED IN REGIONAL BANKING.

THE NEW CONSUMER LENDING REPORTING SEGMENT NOW

COMPRISES: (A) THE PRIOR MORTGAGE BANKING AND AUTO

FINANCE REPORTING SEGMENTS,(B) THE HOME EQUITY,

STUDENT AND OTHER LENDING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHICH

WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE REGIONAL BANKING

REPORTING SEGMENT AND (C) LOAN ACTIVITY RELATED TO

PRIME MORTGAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED BY RFS, BUT

REPORTED IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS

SEGMENT. THIS REORGANIZATION IS REFLECTED IN THIS

ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR

PRIOR PERIODS HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE

CHANGES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IN EFFECT THROUGHOUT

ALL PERIODS REPORTED.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A

STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING

PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED

METHODOLOGIES.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGIES USED BY

THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO

ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING

CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND

FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE

REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT

RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST

INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND TRANSFER

THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO THE

TREASURY GROUP WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE

TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST

RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SEGMENTS STAND-ALONE PEERS.

THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY THE FIRMS

ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO). BUSINESS

SEGMENTS MAY RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURES, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, THAT

WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF A

SIMILAR PEER BUSINESS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER

COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY INCREASED DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2008 IN IB AND AM DUE TO THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER AND, FOR AM, THE PURCHASE OF THE

ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE. AT THE

END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, EQUITY WAS

INCREASED FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS WITH A VIEW

TOWARD THE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL

II CAPITAL RULES. FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE

RULES, SEE BASEL II ON PAGE 72 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. IN ADDITION, EQUITY ALLOCATED TO RFS,CS AND

CB WAS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

CAPITAL MANAGEMENTLINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGE

70 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY

SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE

SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON

THEIR ACTUAL COST OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR

MARKET, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES

PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE

RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO

CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE

RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED EXPENSE INCLUDES.

PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF

THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE

STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH

MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT

ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

REVENUE INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION

OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 ON JANUARY 1, 2007. SEE

PAGES 8099 OF THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

(D)

RESULTS FOR 2008 INCLUDE SEVEN MONTHS OF THE

COMBINED FIRMS (JPMORGAN CHASES AND BEAR

STEARNS) RESULTS AND FIVE MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. ALL PRIOR PERIODS REFLECT

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET LOSS WAS $1.2 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $4.3

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER TOTAL

NET REVENUE, A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

AND HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A REDUCTION IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ON OVERSEAS

EARNINGS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $12.2 BILLION, DOWN $6.0

BILLION, OR 33%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES WERE $5.9 BILLION, DOWN 11% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEBT UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY FEES REFLECTING REDUCED MARKET ACTIVITY.

DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $2.2 BILLION, DOWN 18%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER LOAN

SYNDICATION AND BOND UNDERWRITING FEES. ADVISORY

FEES OF $2.0 BILLION DECLINED 12% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $1.7 BILLION,

UP 2%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY IMPROVED MARKET

SHARE. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE WAS $2.0

BILLION, COMPARED WITH $6.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY $5.9

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BILLION OF NET MARKDOWNS ON MORTGAGE-RELATED

EXPOSURES AND $4.7 BILLION OF NET MARKDOWNS ON

LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS.

REVENUE WAS ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL

LOSSES AND COST TO RISK REDUCE RELATED TO BEAR

STEARNS POSITIONS. THESE RESULTS WERE OFFSET BY

RECORD PERFORMANCE IN RATES AND CURRENCIES, CREDIT

TRADING, COMMODITIES AND EMERGING MARKETS AS WELL

AS $814 MILLION OF GAINS FROM THE WIDENING OF THE

FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON CERTAIN STRUCTURED

LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE

WAS $3.6 BILLION, DOWN 7% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING WEAK TRADING RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY STRONG CLIENT REVENUE ACROSS PRODUCTS INCLUDING

PRIME SERVICES, AS WELL AS $510 MILLION OF GAINS

FROM THE WIDENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD ON

CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE WAS $739 MILLION, DOWN

44%, DRIVEN BY LOSSES FROM WIDENING COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES WAS $2.0 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING A HIGHER ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, DRIVEN BY A WEAKENING CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF THE TRANSFER

OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM

HELD-FOR-SALE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. NET

CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR WERE $105 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $36 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL

NONPERFORMING ASSETS WERE $2.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $2.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS

4.71% FOR 2008, COMPARED WITH A RATIO OF 2.14% IN

THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $13.8 BILLION, UP $770

MILLION, OR 6%,FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

HIGHER NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

ADDITIONAL EXPENSE RELATING TO THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER, OFF-SET PARTIALLY BY LOWER

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS A NEGATIVE 5% ON $26.1 BILLION

OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL, COMPARED WITH 15% ON

$21.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME WAS $3.1 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $535

MILLION, OR 15%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE

REFLECTED LOWER FIXED INCOME REVENUE, A HIGHER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND INCREASED

NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RECORD

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $18.2 BILLION, DOWN $663

MILLION, OR 4%,FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES WERE $6.6 BILLION, UP 19% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY RECORD

FEES ACROSS ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES.

ADVISORY FEES WERE $2.3 BILLION, UP 37%, AND EQUITY

UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $1.7 BILLION, UP 45%; BOTH

WERE DRIVEN BY RECORD PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL

REGIONS. DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.6 BILLION

DECLINED 3%, REFLECTING LOWER LOAN SYNDICATION AND

BOND UNDERWRITING FEES, WHICH WERE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF

THE YEAR. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE DECREASED

27% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO

NET MARKDOWNS OF $1.4 BILLION ON SUBPRIME

POSITIONS, INCLUDING SUBPRIME CDOS AND NET

MARKDOWNS OF $1.3 BILLION ON LEVERAGED LENDING

FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. FIXED INCOME

MARKETS REVENUE ALSO DECREASED DUE TO MARKDOWNS IN

SECURITIZED PRODUCTS ON NONSUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND

WEAK CREDIT TRADING PERFORMANCE. THESE LOWER

RESULTS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY RECORD REVENUE IN

CURRENCIES AND STRONG REVENUE IN RATES. EQUITY

MARKETS REVENUE WAS $3.9 BILLION, UP 13%, BENEFITING

FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY AND RECORD TRADING

RESULTS ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS. CREDIT PORTFOLIO

REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION, UP 19%, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER REVENUE FROM RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN SALES AND

WORKOUTS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $654 MILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $463 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CHANGE WAS DUE TO A NET INCREASE OF $532

MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

PRIMARILY DUE TO PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDED

THE EFFECT OF A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND

AN INCREASE IN ALLOWANCE FOR UNFUNDED LEVERAGED

LENDING COMMITMENTS, AS WELL AS PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THERE WERE $36 MILLION OF NET

CHARGE-OFFS IN 2007, COMPARED WITH $31 MILLION OF

NET RECOVERIES IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS 2.14% FOR

2007, COMPARED WITH A RATIO OF 1.79% IN THE PRIOR

YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $13.1 BILLION, UP $214

MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 15% ON $21.0 BILLION OF

ALLOCATED CAPITAL COMPARED WITH 18% ON $20.8

BILLION IN 2006.

NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND THE BANK ONE MERGER OF $394 MILLION, $460 MILLION AND

$458 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET INCOME WAS $880 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $2.0 BILLION, OR 70%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POSITIVE MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $23.5 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $6.2 BILLION, OR 36%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $14.2 BILLION, UP $3.6 BILLION, OR 35%, BENEFITING FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WIDER LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS, AND HIGHER LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $9.4 BILLION, UP $2.6 BILLION, OR 38%, AS POSITIVE MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS, THE

IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER MORTGAGE ORIGINATION VOLUME AND HIGHER

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN RESERVES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF

PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AND MARKDOWNS ON THE MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $9.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $7.3 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

DELINQUENCY RATES HAVE INCREASED DUE TO OVERALL WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHILE HOUSING PRICE

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $17.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$2.5 BILLION, OR 17%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET

INTEREST INCOME WAS $10.5 BILLION, UP $361 MILLION,

OR 4%, DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION,

WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES.

THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND A SHIFT TO

NARROWERSPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $6.8 BILLION, UP $2.1 BILLION,

BENEFITING FROM POSITIVE MSR RISK MANAGEMENT

RESULTS; AN INCREASE IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES; AND

THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR-YEAR $233 MILLION LOSS

RELATED TO $13.3 BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS

TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE. NONINTEREST REVENUE

ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN

MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS EXPENSE (LOAN

ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED AGAINST REVENUE

COMMENCED BEING RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007 DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159).

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.6 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $561 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

CURRENT YEAR PROVISION INCLUDES A NET INCREASE OF

$1.0 BILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

RELATED TO HOME EQUITY LOANS AS CONTINUED WEAK

HOUSING PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN

ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE LOANS. HOME

EQUITY NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $564 MILLION (0.62% NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE), COMPARED WITH $143 MILLION (0.18%

NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IN

ADDITION, THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDES A

$166 MILLION INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES RELATED TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES AND

GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE NET

CHARGE-OFFS WERE $157 MILLION (1.55% NET CHARGE-OFF

RATE),COMPARED WITH $47 MILLION (0.34% NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $9.9 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $978 MILLION, OR 11%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION; THE

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS

EXPENSE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159;

INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND

HIGHER MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING EXPENSE.

THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE

OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

CONSUMER LENDING NET LOSS WAS $2.1 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $680 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $10.9 BILLION, UP

$3.6 BILLION, OR 48%, DRIVEN BY HIGHER MORTGAGE

FEES AND RELATED INCOME (DUE PRIMARILY TO POSITIVE

MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS), THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES

AND WIDER LOAN SPREADS.

THE INCREASE IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE OF

$898 MILLION WAS UP $18 MILLION, AS HIGHER MORTGAGE

ORIGINATION VOLUME WAS PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE IN RESERVES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF

PREVIOUSLY SOLD LOANS AND MARKDOWNS OF THE MORTGAGE

WAREHOUSE. NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE (WHICH

INCLUDES LOAN SERVICING REVENUE, MSR RISK

MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE)

WAS $2.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.5 BILLION, OR

124%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. LOAN SERVICING REVENUE

WAS $3.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $924 MILLION.

THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED INCREASED 91%, PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. MSR RISK

MANAGEMENT RESULTS WERE $1.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$411 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OTHER CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET WERE NEGATIVE $2.1

BILLION, COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE $1.5 BILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $9.5 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $2.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

PROVISION REFLECTED WEAKNESS IN THE HOME EQUITY AND

MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS (SEE RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

DISCUSSION OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR

FURTHER DETAIL).

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $4.8 BILLION, UP $1.1

BILLION, OR 30%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING

HIGHER MORTGAGE REINSURANCE LOSSES, THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER

SERVICING EXPENSE DUE TO INCREASED DELINQUENCIES

AND DEFAULTS.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

CONSUMER LENDING NET INCOME WAS $680 MILLION, A

DECREASE OF $611 MILLION, OR 47%, FROM THE PRIOR

REVENUE, WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND THE ABSENCE OF A

PRIOR-YEAR $233 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO $13.3

BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO

HELD-FOR-SALE. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY

BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE WAS $880 MILLION, UP

$576 MILLION, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE

IN MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND THE

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS

EXPENSE (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED

AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING RECORDED AS AN

ADOPTION OF SFAS 159).THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY MARKDOWNS OF $241 MILLION ON THE

SERVICING REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES LOAN SERVICING

REVENUE, MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND OTHER

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WAS $1.2 BILLION, COMPARED

WITH $314 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOAN SERVICING

REVENUE OF $2.3 BILLION INCREASED $195 MILLION ON

17% GROWTH IN THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED. MSR RISK

MANAGEMENT RESULTS WERE POSITIVE $411 MILLION

COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE $385 MILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET

WERE NEGATIVE $1.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE

$1.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.5 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $447 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE IN THE PROVISION WAS DUE TO THE HOME

EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS (SEE RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES DISCUSSION OF THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES FOR FURTHER DETAIL).

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $3.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $479 MILLION, OR 15%. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS

DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159; HIGHER SERVICING

COSTS DUE TO INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS;

HIGHER PRODUCTION EXPENSE DUE TO GROWTH IN

ORIGINATIONS; AND INCREASED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON

CARD SERVICES

CHASE CARD SERVICES IS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST CARD

ISSUERS WITH MORE THAN 168 MILLION CREDIT CARDS IN CIRCULATION AND MORE THAN $190 BILLION IN

MANAGED LOANS.

CUSTOMERS USED CHASE CARDS TO MEET MORE THAN $368

BILLION WORTH OF THEIR SPENDING NEEDS IN 2008. CHASE HAS

A MARKET LEADERSHIP POSITION IN BUILDING LOYALTY AND

REWARDS PROGRAMS WITH MANY OF THE WORLDS MOST

RESPECTED BRANDS AND THROUGH ITS PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS,

WHICH INCLUDE THE CHASE FREEDOM PROGRAM.

THROUGH ITS MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS, CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, CHASE IS ONE OF THE LEADING

PROCESSORS OF MASTERCARD AND VISA PAYMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED BASIS TO EVALUATE

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF ITS CREDIT CARD LOANS, BOTH LOANS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND LOANS THAT

HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 3839 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGED RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON

TOTAL NET REVENUE, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND

LOAN RECEIVABLES. SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE REPORTED NET INCOME;

HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF CS FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTS THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS

CREDIT CARD OPERATIONS, INCLUDING $28.3

BILLION OF MANAGED CREDIT CARD LOANS, AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, AND

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET INCOME WAS $780 MILLION, A DECLINE OF $2.1

BILLION, OR 73%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE

WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TOTAL NET REVENUE.

AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS WERE $162.9 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $13.5 BILLION, OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AVERAGE MANAGED

LOANS WERE $155.9 BILLION. END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED

LOANS WERE $190.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $33.3

BILLION, OR 21%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING

WASHINGTON MUTUAL, END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE

$162.1 BILLION. THE INCREASES IN BOTH AVERAGE

MANAGED LOANS AND END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS WERE

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND ORGANIC PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $16.5 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $1.2 BILLION, OR 8%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.8 BILLION, UP

$1.6 BILLION, OR 13%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN

BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, HIGHER

AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES, AND WIDER LOAN

SPREADS. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED

WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS

$2.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $327 MILLION, OR 11%,

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED REWARDS

EXPENSE, LOWER SECURITIZATION INCOME DRIVEN BY

HIGHER CREDIT LOSSES, AND HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN

PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS; THESE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY

INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, BENEFITING FROM A 4%

INCREASE IN CHARGE VOLUME, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $10.1

BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $4.3 BILLION, OR 76%, FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $1.7 BILLION

IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND A HIGHER LEVEL

OF CHARGE-OFFS. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

INCREASED TO

5.01%, UP FROM 3.68% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY

MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 4.97%, UP FROM 3.48%

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, THE

MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 4.92% AND THE

30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 4.36%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $226 MILLION, OR 5%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR,

PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME OF $2.9 BILLION WAS DOWN $287 MILLION,

OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. PRIOR-YEAR RESULTS

BENEFITED FROM SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS

FOLLOWING THE

CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005. THE INCREASE IN NET CHARGE-OFFS

WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER REVENUE.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS OF $157.1 BILLION

INCREASED $4.2 BILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS OF $149.3 BILLION INCREASED

$8.2 BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASES IN BOTH END-OF-PERIOD AND AVERAGE MANAGED

LOANS RESULTED FROM ORGANIC GROWTH.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $15.2 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $490 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $12.2 BILLION, UP

$388 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY A

HIGHER LEVEL OF FEES AND HIGHER AVERAGE LOAN

BALANCES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

NARROWER LOAN SPREADS, THE DISCONTINUATION OF

CERTAIN BILLING PRACTICES (INCLUDING THE

ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN OVER-LIMIT FEES AND THE

TWO-CYCLE BILLING METHOD FOR CALCULATING FINANCE

CHARGES BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007)

AND THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS

ASSOCIATED

WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $3.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $102

MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE

REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF FEE-BASED REVENUE AND

INCREASED NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, WHICH BENEFITED

FROM HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME. CHARGE VOLUME GROWTH WAS

4%, REFLECTING A 9% INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME,

OFFSET PRIMARILY BY A LOWER LEVEL OF BALANCE

TRANSFERS, THE RESULT OF MORE TARGETED MARKETING

EFFORTS.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $5.7

BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.1 BILLION, OR 24%, FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

HIGHER LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS (THE PRIOR YEAR

BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005) AND AN INCREASE IN

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE

MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 3.68%, UP FROM

3.33% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED

DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 3.48%, UP FROM 3.13% IN THE

PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $4.9 BILLION, A DECREASE OF

$172 MILLION, OR 3%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE AND LOWER

FRAUD-RELATED EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSE.

2008 COMPARED WITH 2007

NET INCOME WAS $1.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $305

RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $4.8 BILLION INCREASED

$674 MILLION, OR 16%. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $3.3

BILLION INCREASED $456 MILLION, OR 16%, DRIVEN BY

DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND LOAN BALANCES

AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPREAD COMPRESSION

IN THE LIABILITY AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $1.5 BILLION, UP $218 MILLION, OR 17%,

DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LENDING-RELATED FEES.

ON A CLIENT SEGMENT BASIS, MIDDLE MARKET BANKING

REVENUE WAS $2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $250

MILLION, OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE

PREDOMINANTLY TO HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND

GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND LOAN BALANCES. REVENUE FROM

ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION ENCOMPASSING MULTI-FAMILY AND

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, WAS $243 MILLION.

LOSSES INCREASED $1.1 BILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMING ASSETS WERE $1.1

BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND HIGHER REAL

ESTATE-RELATED BALANCES.

$12 MILLION, OR 1%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO

LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND

VOLUME-BASED CHARGES FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS,

PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME WAS $1.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $124

HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $4.1 BILLION INCREASED $303 MILLION, OR

8%. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $2.8 BILLION INCREASED

$113 MILLION, OR 4%, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH

ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED SHIFT

TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND SPREAD

COMPRESSION IN THE LOAN AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION, UP $190

ENVIRONMENT.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.3 BILLION, DOWN $217 MILLION, OR 4%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO

LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007.

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS; FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS;

SECURITIES BORROWED; FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND

SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM UTILIZES DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, FEDERAL

FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED, AND FEDERAL FUNDS

PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE THE FIRMS CASH

POSITIONS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM USES

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND

SECURITIES BORROWED TO PROVIDE FUNDING OR LIQUIDITY

TO CLIENTS BY PURCHASING AND BORROWING CLIENTS

SECURITIES FOR THE SHORT-TERM. FEDERAL FUNDS

PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE USED AS SHORT-TERM

FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE FIRM AND TO MAKE SECURITIES

AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM PURPOSES.

THE INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, IN DEPOSITS

WITH BANKS REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF INTERBANK

LENDING; A RECLASSIFICATION OF DEPOSITS WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK FROM CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

TO DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING A POLICY CHANGE

OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK TO PAY INTEREST TO

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ON RESERVE BALANCES, AND

ASSETS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED AND

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS WAS

RELATED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER AND GROWTH IN DEMAND FROM CLIENTS

FOR LIQUIDITY. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS REFLECTED HIGHER

SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS TO FULFILL CLIENTS

DEMAND FOR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCE THE FIRMS AFS

SECURITIES INVENTORY, AND THE EFFECT OF THE

LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES 7680

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRM USES DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS

FOR BOTH MARKET-MAKING AND PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING

ACTIVITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY

OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT

AND CORPORATE DEBT; EQUITY, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE

SECURITIES; LOANS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PRIME MORTGAGE

AND OTHER LOANS WAREHOUSED BY RFS AND IB FOR SALE

OR SECURITIZATION PURPOSES AND ACCOUNTED FOR AT

FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159; AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

INVENTORIES. THE DECREASES IN TRADING ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF THE

CHALLENGING CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT,

PARTICULARLY FOR DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY POSITIONS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER

TO NOTE 4 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES 129143 AND

146148, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO

INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR

MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS INTEREST RATE,

CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY OR COMMODITY

PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN

DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS, IS AN END-USER OF

DERIVATIVES FOR ITS PRINCIPAL RISK-TAKING

ACTIVITIES, AND IS ALSO AN END-USER OF DERIVATIVES

TO HEDGE OR MANAGE RISKS OF MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES,

MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED

BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING

PURPOSES. THE INCREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

AND PAYABLES FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES, WIDENING

CREDIT SPREADS AND VOLATILE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

REFLECTED IN INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE

ALSO INCLUDED POSITIONS ACQUIRED IN THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER

TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, NOTE 4, NOTE 6 AND NOTE 32

ON PAGES 129143, 146148, AND 202205,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITIES

ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS

CLASSIFIED AS AFS AND IS USED PREDOMINANTLY TO

MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS TO MAKE STRATEGIC LONGER-TERM

INVESTMENTS. THE AFS PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, PREDOMINANTLY AS A RESULT OF

PURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES AND

MATURITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO

SECURITIES, REFER TO THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT DISCUSSION, NOTE 4 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES

6163, 129143 AND 158162, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS,

FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. LOANS INCREASED FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, LARGELY DUE TO LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ORGANIC GROWTH IN

LENDING IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY

CB, AND GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER PRIME MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIO DRIVEN BY THE DECISION TO RETAIN, RATHER

THAN SELL, NEW ORIGINATIONS OF NONCONFORMING

MORTGAGE LOANS.

BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE COMPONENTS OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR REFLECTING THE ADDITION OF NONCREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, INCLUDING AN INCREASE TO CONFORM THE ALLOWANCE APPLICABLE TO ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO THE

FIRMS LOAN LOSS METHODOLOGIES. EXCLUDING THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION THE CONSUMER

ALLOWANCE ROSE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED

LOSSES FOR HOME EQUITY, SUBPRIME MORTGAGE, PRIME

MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD LOANS DUE TO THE EFFECTS

OF CONTINUED HOUSING PRICE DECLINES, RISING

UNEMPLOYMENT AND A WEAKENING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, THE

INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE WAS DUE TO THE

IMPACT OF THE TRANSFER OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED

AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGED LENDING LOANS IN IB TO THE

RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO FROM THE HELD-FOR-SALE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, THE EFFECT OF A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND LOAN GROWTH. FOR A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 8099, AND NOTES 4, 5, 14 AND 15 ON PAGES

129143, 144146, 163166 AND 166168,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

THE FIRMS ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

CONSIST OF ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE FROM

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS; RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS

(PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IBS PRIME

SERVICES BUSINESS);

RECEIVABLES FROM BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING

ORGANIZATIONS; AND RECEIVABLES FROM FAILED

SECURITIES SALES. THE FIRMS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND

OTHER LIABILITIES CONSIST OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO

CUSTOMERS (PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS), PAYABLES TO BROKERS,

DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS; PAYABLES FROM

FAILED SECURITIES PURCHASES; ACCRUED EXPENSE,

INCLUDING FOR INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES; AND ALL

OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING OBLIGATIONS TO RETURN

SECURITIES RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL. THE INCREASE IN

ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS DUE LARGELY TO THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER, REFLECTING HIGHER CUSTOMER

RECEIVABLES IN IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THE INCREASE IN

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER,

REFLECTING HIGHER CUSTOMER PAYABLES (PRIMARILY

RELATED TO IBS PRIME SERVICES BUSINESS), AS WELL

AS HIGHER OBLIGATIONS TO RETURN SECURITIES RECEIVED

AS COLLATERAL. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE

22 ON PAGE 190 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ARISES FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND

REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF AN ACQUIRED

ENTITY OVER THE NET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE

INCREASE IN GOODWILL WAS DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO THE

DISSOLUTION OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT

VENTURE, THE MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS, THE PURCHASE

OF AN ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE AND

TAX-RELATED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANK ONE MERGER, WHICH

INCREASED GOODWILL ATTRIBUTED TO IB. THESE

ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A DECREASE IN

GOODWILL ATTRIBUTED TO TSS PREDOMINANTLY RESULTING

FROM THE SALE OF A PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 18

ON PAGES 186189 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE FIRMS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF MSRS,

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, OTHER CREDIT

CARD-RELATED INTANGIBLES, CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES,

AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. MSRS INCREASED DUE TO THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER; SALES IN RFS OF ORIGINATED LOANS; AND

PURCHASES OF MSRS. THESE INCREASES IN MSRS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKDOWNS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE MSR ASSET DUE TO CHANGES TO INPUTS AND

ASSUMPTIONS IN THE MSR VALUATION MODEL, INCLUDING

UPDATES TO PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS TO REFLECT

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, AND TO SERVICING PORTFOLIO

RUN-OFFS. THE DECREASE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REFLECTS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH

CREDIT CARD-RELATED AND CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES DUE TO THE

DISSOLUTION OF THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS JOINT

VENTURE, THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL EQUITY

INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE, AND THE ACQUISITION OF AN

INSTITUTIONAL GLOBAL CUSTODY PORTFOLIO. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, SEE NOTE 18 ON PAGES 186189 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER ASSETS

THE FIRMS OTHER ASSETS CONSIST OF PRIVATE EQUITY

AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS, COLLATERAL RECEIVED, CORPORATE

AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, PREMISES

AND EQUIPMENT, ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTION

(INCLUDING REAL ESTATE OWNED), AND ALL OTHER

ASSETS. THE INCREASE IN OTHER ASSETS FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, WAS DUE TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, WHICH

PARTLY RESULTED IN A HIGHER VOLUME OF COLLATERAL

RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, AND THE PURCHASE OF ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVES ASSET-BACKED

COMMERCIAL PAPER MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY

FACILITY (AML FACILITY), WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, AS A

TEMPORARY LENDING FACILITY TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO

ELIGIBLE MMMFS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DEPOSITS

THE FIRMS DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO

CUSTOMERS, BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE, RELATED TO

NON-BROKERAGE FUNDS HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS

ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION (U.S. AND

NON-U.S.), WHETHER THEY ARE INTEREST OR

NONINTEREST-BEARING, AND BY TYPE (I.E., DEMAND,

MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT, SAVINGS, TIME OR NEGOTIABLE

ORDER OF WITHDRAWAL ACCOUNTS). DEPOSITS HELP

PROVIDE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING

FOR THE FIRM. DEPOSITS WERE AT A HIGHER LEVEL

COMPARED WITH THE LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

PREDOMINANTLY FROM THE DEPOSITS ASSUMED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, NET INCREASES IN

WHOLESALE INTEREST- AND NONINTEREST-BEARING

DEPOSITS IN TSS, AM AND CB. THE INCREASE IN TSS WAS

DRIVEN BY BOTH NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS, AND DUE TO

THE DEPOSIT INFLOWS RELATED TO THE HEIGHTENED

VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS AFFECTING THE

MARKETS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DEPOSITS, REFER TO

THE TSS AND RFS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 5657

AND 4550, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 7680 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON WHOLESALE

LIABILITY BALANCES, INCLUDING DEPOSITS, REFER TO

THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 5455

AND 5657 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM UTILIZES COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER

BORROWED FUNDS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, AND IN

CONNECTION WITH A TSS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT

WHEREBY EXCESS CLIENT FUNDS, ARE TRANSFERRED INTO

COMMERCIAL PAPER OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS. THE

INCREASE IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS WAS PREDOMINANTLY

DUE TO ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS OF

$70.2 BILLION (NET OF MATURITIES OF $10.4 BILLION)

THAT WERE ASSUMED AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION AND NONRECOURSE ADVANCES FROM THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON (FRBB) TO FUND

PURCHASES OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET MUTUAL

FUNDS, AND OTHER BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVE UNDER THE TERM AUCTION FACILITY PROGRAM.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, SEE PAGES

7680 AND NOTE 21 ON PAGE 190 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

THE FIRM UTILIZES LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES TO PROVIDE

COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDS AND

AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY AND

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO DEBT

ASSUMED IN BOTH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, AND DEBT ISSUANCES

OF $20.8 BILLION, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC

UNDER ITS TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM

(THE TLG PROGRAM). THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY NET MATURITIES AND REDEMPTIONS, INCLUDING

IB STRUCTURED NOTES, THE ISSUANCES OF WHICH ARE

GENERALLY CLIENT-DRIVEN. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON THE FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

7680 AND NOTE 23 ON PAGES 191192 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

THE INCREASE IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE

ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES

DURING 2008. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

JPMORGAN CHASE PARTICIPATED IN THE CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM AND ISSUED PREFERRED STOCK AND A WARRANT TO

PURCHASE COMMON STOCK TO THE U.S. TREASURY,

RESULTING IN A $25.0 BILLION INCREASE TO

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. ADDITIONAL PREFERRED STOCK

ISSUANCES AND A COMMON STOCK ISSUANCE DURING 2008

INCREASED EQUITY BY $19.3 BILLION. EQUITY FROM

ISSUANCES OF STOCK AWARDS UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS, THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER, AND NET INCOME FOR 2008 WAS MORE THAN

OFFSET BY THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND NET

LOSSES RECORDED WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO AFS SECURITIES AND

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

SECTION THAT FOLLOWS, AND NOTE 24 AND NOTE 27 ON

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES

OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) AND

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G.,

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY

SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO

INVESTORS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER,

SHORT-TERM ASSET-BACKED NOTES, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

AND OTHER FORMS OF INTEREST. SPES ARE GENERALLY

STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE

SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES,

INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE

ASSETS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS

AND RISKS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE

MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY

FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING

FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH

SPES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND INVESTOR

INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND AS A RESULT OF ITS

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, THROUGH QUALIFYING SPECIAL

PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES). THIS DISCUSSION FOCUSES

MOSTLY ON MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND INVESTOR

INTERMEDIATION. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ALL

SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, AND THE

RELATED ACCOUNTING, SEE NOTE 1, NOTE 16 AND NOTE 17

ON PAGES 122123, 168176 AND 177186,

RESPECTIVELY OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED

EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK

TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED

AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE

EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD

VIOLATE THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES

PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON

BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY

OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

INTEREST.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM

COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

N.A., WAS DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS,

PRIMARILY P-1,

A-1 AND F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND

FITCH,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF THESE LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS WAS $61.0 BILLION AND $94.0 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WERE

DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF PROVIDING FUNDING

UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT, OR IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR

REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE IN ORDER TO

PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED

IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AS SHOWN IN THE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES TABLE ON PAGE 69 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH THREE

TYPES OF SPES. A SUMMARY OF EACH TYPE OF SPE

FOLLOWS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM HELPS CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS

BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS

THROUGH VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) KNOWN

AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE ENTITIES

THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED

BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM.

THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF

REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW

FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES

FEES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURING OF MULTI-SELLER

CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND RECEIVES COMPENSATION FROM

THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND

PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES

CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH

THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS

INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT,

MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES THE FIRM USES

IN THESE STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES AND

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION VEHICLES.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF

LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT

CARDS, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS

(PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE). JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS

PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES ARE

STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT REFLECTED ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR

RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW). THE

PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE VEHICLES IS TO MEET

INVESTOR NEEDS AND GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM

THROUGH THE

SALE OF LOANS TO THE QSPES. THESE QSPES ARE

FINANCED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF FIXED OR

FLOATING-RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE SOLD

TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OR HELD BY THE FIRM.

AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM SUBPRIME

ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS MODIFICATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM

(ASF) ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND

LOSS AVOIDANCE FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME

ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS (THE FRAMEWORK).

THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR SERVICERS TO

STREAMLINE EVALUATION PROCEDURES OF BORROWERS WITH

CERTAIN SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE (ARM)

LOANS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE MODIFICATION OF

SUCH LOANS WITH TERMS THAT ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR

THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SUCH BORROWERS. THE

FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL FIRST-LIEN SUBPRIME ARM

LOANS THAT HAVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST FOR AN

INITIAL PERIOD OF 36 MONTHS OR LESS; ARE INCLUDED

IN

SECURITIZED POOLS; WERE ORIGINATED BETWEEN JANUARY

1, 2005, AND JULY 31, 2007; AND HAVE AN INITIAL

INTEREST RATE RESET DATE BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2008,

AND JULY 31, 2010. THE FRAMEWORK CATEGORIZES THE

POPULATION OF ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS INTO THREE

SEGMENTS. SEGMENT 1 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE

BORROWER IS CURRENT AND LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

REFINANCE INTO ANY AVAILABLE MORTGAGE PRODUCT.

SEGMENT 2 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS

CURRENT, UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO ANY

READILY AVAILABLE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY PRODUCT AND

MEETS CERTAIN DEFINED CRITERIA. SEGMENT 3 INCLUDES

LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS NOT CURRENT, AS

DEFINED, AND DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR

SEGMENTS 1 OR 2.

JPMORGAN CHASE ADOPTED THE FRAMEWORK DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. FOR THOSE AFS FRAMEWORK

LOANS SERVICED BY THE FIRM AND OWNED BY

FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES, THE FIRM MODIFIED PRINCIPAL

AMOUNTS OF $1.7 BILLION OF SEGMENT 2 SUBPRIME

MORTGAGES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS SELECTED INFORMATION

RELATING TO THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SEGMENT 3

LOANS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, INCLUDING THOSE THAT

HAVE BEEN MODIFIED, SUBJECTED TO OTHER LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES OR

HAVE BEEN PREPAID BY THE BORROWER.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS

CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW

UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO

FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND

THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM

ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. THESE

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES HISTORICALLY EXPIRE

WITHOUT BEING DRAWN AND EVEN HIGHER PROPORTIONS

EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN

THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE,

AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND

THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGE 90 AND NOTE 33 ON PAGES

206210 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM

ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT

MAY REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. COMMITMENTS FOR

FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE

FUTURE SERVICES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO

REAL ESTATERELATED OBLIGATIONS AND EQUIPMENT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE SUMMARIZES, BY REMAINING

MATURITY, JPMORGAN CHASES OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES AND

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE TABLE BELOW REFLECT

THE MINIMUM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION UNDER LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE BOTH

FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. EXCLUDED FROM THE

FOLLOWING TABLE ARE A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS TO BE

SETTLED IN CASH, PRIMARILY IN UNDER ONE YEAR.

THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INCLUDE FEDERAL

FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; COMMERCIAL PAPER;

OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; PURCHASES OF DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVE PAYABLES; AND CERTAIN

PURCHASES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT RESULTED IN

SETTLEMENT FAILURES. ALSO EXCLUDED ARE CONTINGENT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS

INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CAPITAL SUFFICIENT

TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO MAINTAIN

WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL

ABOVE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN AMOUNTS DEEMED

APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE THE FIRMS REGULATORY AND

DEBT RATING OBJECTIVES. THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING

EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IS INTEGRATED INTO

THE FIRMS CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND IS OVERSEEN BY THE

ALCO.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS

BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS



MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT

WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING

SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK

MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. CAPITAL

IS ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE

OF BUSINESS. RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY IS MEASURED

AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE

ESTABLISHED AS A KEY MEASURE OF A BUSINESS

SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE.

RELATIVE TO 2007, LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY INCREASED

DURING 2008, REFLECTING GROWTH ACROSS THE

BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, AT THE END OF THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2008, EQUITY WAS INCREASED FOR EACH LINE

OF BUSINESS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II CAPITAL RULES.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE RULES, SEE BASEL II ON

PAGE 72 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FINALLY, DURING

2008, CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO RFS, CS, AND CB WAS

INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION; CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO AM WAS INCREASED

DUE TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND THE PURCHASE OF

THE ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE; AND

CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO IB WAS INCREASED DUE TO THE

BEAR STEARNS MERGER.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142, THE LINES OF

BUSINESS PERFORM THE REQUIRED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

TESTING. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL AND

IMPAIRMENT TESTING, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY

RELATIVE TO THE RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL

RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM ASSIGNS

ECONOMIC CAPITAL PRIMARILY BASED UPON FOUR RISK

FACTORS: CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK

AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK. IN 2008, THE GROWTH IN

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER CREDIT

RISK CAPITAL, WHICH WAS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO

A COMBINATION OF HIGHER DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE, A

WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND ASSET GROWTH

RELATED TO THE BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) AND

CONSUMER BUSINESSES (RFS AND CS).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE

CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND DECLINES IN

THE PORTFOLIO VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION,

MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE

LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT RATING

STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF

THOSE FOR WHICH PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE

MAINTAINED. THE CAPITAL METHODOLOGY IS BASED UPON

SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE

AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), DEFAULT

LIKELIHOOD, CREDIT SPREADS, LOSS SEVERITY AND

PORTFOLIO CORRELATION.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS

BASED UPON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK

SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND

SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL

CONSISTENT WITH AN AA CREDIT RATING STANDARD.

STATISTICAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OR

PORTFOLIOS ARE ADJUSTED TO ENSURE THAT CAPITAL IS

CONSISTENT WITH EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS, SUCH AS

SUBORDINATION LEVELS ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR

CAPITAL HELD AT REPRESENTATIVE MONOLINE

COMPETITORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY

THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE RISK

OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN MARKET

VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, SECURITIES PRICES AND

COMMODITIES PRICES. DAILY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR),

BIWEEKLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE

USED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. THE

FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT

SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES. SEE MARKET

RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 99104 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK

MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR

OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL

RISK ON A BOTTOM-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED UPON ACTUAL LOSSES AND

POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

OR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM

BELIEVES ITS MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL

II FRAMEWORK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY HELD

SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS AND

COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO

COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE

IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS,

POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY LIQUIDITY RISK. THE

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO

IS BASED UPON MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS EXPERIENCE

SUFFERED BY THE FIRM AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS

OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET

CONDITIONS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) ESTABLISHES CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS

FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)

ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE GRANTED THE FIRM, FOR A PERIOD

OF 18

MONTHS FOLLOWING THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, RELIEF UP

TO A CERTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNT AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

CONDITIONS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVES RISK-BASED

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO

BEAR STEARNS RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OTHER

EXPOSURES ACQUIRED. THE AMOUNT OF SUCH RELIEF IS

SUBJECT TO REDUCTION BY ONE-SIXTH EACH QUARTER

SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER AND EXPIRES ON OCTOBER 1,

2009. THE OCC GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

SIMILAR RELIEF FROM ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED A WELL-CAPITALIZED

POSITION, BASED UPON TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL

RATIOS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, AS INDICATED

IN THE TABLES BELOW. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE

THE FASB HAS BEEN DELIBERATING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO BOTH

SFAS 140 AND FIN 46R THAT MAY IMPACT THE ACCOUNTING FOR

TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE QSPES AND VIES. BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF

THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AND THE FIRM'S INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSAL,

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT THE IMPACT OF CONSOLIDATION COULD BE UP TO

$70 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, $40 BILLION OF

ASSETS RELATED TO FIRM-SPONSORED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AND

$50 BILLION OF OTHER LOANS (INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES);

THE DECREASE IN THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO COULD BE APPROXIMATELY

80 BASIS POINTS. THE ULTIMATE IMPACT COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY

DUE TO THE FASB'S CONTINUING DELIBERATIONS ON THE FINAL REQUIREMENTS

OF THE RULE AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

TIER 1 CAPITAL WAS $136.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2008, COMPARED WITH $88.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2007, AN INCREASE OF $47.4 BILLION.

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM

PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, ON

OCTOBER 28, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S.

TREASURY, FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION,

(I)

2.5 MILLION SHARES OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK, AND

(II) A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES

OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$42.42 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTIDILUTION

AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK

QUALIFIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL.

THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK BEARS CUMULATIVE

DIVIDENDS AT A RATE OF 5% PER YEAR FOR THE FIRST

FIVE YEARS AND 9% PER YEAR THEREAFTER. THE SERIES K PREFERRED

STOCK RANKS EQUALLY WITH THE FIRMS EXISTING 6.15%

CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E;

5.72% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES F;

5.49% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES G;

FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES I; AND 8.63%

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES

J, IN TERMS OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND UPON

LIQUIDATION OF THE FIRM.

ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK MUST BE FULLY PAID BEFORE DIVIDENDS

MAY BE DECLARED OR PAID ON STOCK RANKING JUNIOR OR

EQUALLY WITH THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK. PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, UNTIL OCTOBER 28, 2011, THE U.S. TREASURYS CONSENT

IS REQUIRED FOR ANY INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS ON THE FIRMS COMMON

STOCK FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE LAST QUARTERLY STOCK DIVIDEND DECLARED

BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO OCTOBER 14, 2008, UNLESS THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK IS REDEEMED IN WHOLE BEFORE THEN, OR THE U.S.

TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED ALL OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK IT

OWNS TO THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY NOT REPURCHASE OR REDEEM ANY COMMON

STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE FIRM, OR

ANY TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FIRM

OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, WITHOUT THE PRIOR

CONSENT OF THE U.S. TREASURY (OTHER THAN (I)

REPURCHASES OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK AND

(II) REPURCHASES OF JUNIOR PREFERRED SHARES OR

COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH ANY EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLAN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS

CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE).

BASEL II

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED

BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING

SUPERVISION. IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED

A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). THE GOAL OF

THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO PROVIDE MORE

RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND

PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG

LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS PUBLISHED A

FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH WILL

REQUIRE JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT BASEL II AT THE

HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS

KEY U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II

FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

COMPLETE A QUALIFICATION PERIOD OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS DURING WHICH IT WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE

THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW RULE TO

THE SATISFACTION OF ITS PRIMARY U.S. BANKING

REGULATORS. THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE

CONSISTS OF THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD, STARTING ANY

TIME BETWEEN APRIL 1, 2008, AND APRIL 1, 2010,

FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM TRANSITION PERIOD OF THREE

YEARS. DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, BASEL II

RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT FALL BELOW

CERTAIN FLOORS BASED ON CURRENT (BASEL L)

REGULATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN

THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

HAS ADOPTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT, BASED UPON

VARIOUS ESTABLISHED TIMELINES, BASEL II IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER

SUBSIDIARIES ARE J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.

(JPMORGAN SECURITIES) AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING

CORP. (FORMERLY KNOWN AS BEAR STEARNS SECURITIES

CORP.). JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN

CLEARING CORP. ARE EACH SUBJECT TO RULE 15C3-1

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (NET

CAPITAL RULE). JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN

CLEARING CORP. ARE ALSO REGISTERED AS FUTURES

COMMISSION MERCHANTS AND SUBJECT TO RULE 1.17

UNDER THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION

(CFTC).

JPMORGAN

SECURITIES AND J.P. MORGAN CLEARING CORP. HAVE ELECTED TO COMPUTE

THEIR MINIMUM NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT OF THE NET

CAPITAL RULE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, JPMORGAN

SECURITIES NET CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY THE NET

CAPITAL RULE, OF $7.2 BILLION EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM

REQUIREMENT BY $6.6 BILLION. IN ADDITION TO ITS NET

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, JPMORGAN SECURITIES IS

REQUIRED TO

RISK STANDARDS OF APPENDIX E OF THE

NET CAPITAL RULE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, JPMORGAN

SECURITIES HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF

THE MINIMUM AND THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. ON

OCTOBER 1, 2008, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. MERGED

WITH AND INTO BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC., AND THE

SURVIVING ENTITY CHANGED ITS NAME TO J.P. MORGAN

DIVIDENDS

ON

FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE

FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER

SHARE, EFFECTIVE FOR THE DIVIDEND PAYABLE APRIL 30, 2009 TO

SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009. JPMORGAN CHASE DECLARED

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMONS STOCK IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.38

FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2008 AND THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF

2007, AND $0.34 PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 AND FOR EACH

STOCK REPURCHASES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON

STOCK. DURING 2007, UNDER THE RESPECTIVE STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAMS THEN IN EFFECT, THE FIRM

REPURCHASED 168 MILLION SHARES FOR $8.2 BILLION AT

AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $48.60.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED IN APRIL 2007, A

STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE REPURCHASE

OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON SHARES,

WHICH SUPERSEDED AN $8.0 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE

PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2006. THE $10.0 BILLION

AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO

OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT

MAY BE REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS,

INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE

ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL

GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT

INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY

BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING

RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY

TIME. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM

TO REPURCHASE SHARES DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD

NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR

EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT

PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN

MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS

ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL

NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, $6.2 BILLION OF

AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED UNDER

THE CURRENT STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO

PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING

MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN ITS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROPERLY

IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS

CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION: THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS

DEALINGS, INCLUDING LENDING, TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, IS IDENTIFIED AND

AGGREGATED THROUGH THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS WHO

MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE POSITIONS THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

IDENTIFYING AND ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC OR UNUSUAL

EVENTS, THAT MAY NOT BE CAPTURED IN OTHER MODELS, AND THOSE RISKS ARE COMMUNICATED TO

SENIOR MANAGEMENT.



RISK MEASUREMENT: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING

CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS

TESTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUTINELY REVIEWED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK

ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECT UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL: THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

INCORPORATE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING: RISK REPORTING IS EXECUTED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED

BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE

FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK,

OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, AND REPUTATION RISK.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STARTS WITH

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR

MANAGING ITS OWN RISKS. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS WORKS

CLOSELY WITH RISK MANAGEMENT THROUGH ITS OWN RISK

COMMITTEE AND, IN MOST CASES, ITS OWN CHIEF RISK

OFFICER TO MANAGE RISK. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING

THE BUSINESS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND CONTROLS.

OVERLAYING THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT ARE

FOUR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK

MANAGEMENTRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES: TREASURY, THE

CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE AND

RISK MANAGEMENT.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING

COMMITTEE AND WHO REPORTS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY COMMITTEE. RISK

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A FIRMWIDE

FUNCTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS. WITHIN

RISK MANAGEMENT ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT

RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK, AS WELL AS RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES

AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS. RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK POLICY AND

METHODOLOGY, RISK REPORTING AND RISK EDUCATION; AND

RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

BUILDING

THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO

MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

TREASURY AND THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING

AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE

AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE HAS OVERSIGHT FOR LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF

BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CORPORATE

FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT

COMMITTEE, ALCO AND TWO OTHER RISK-RELATED

COMMITTEES, NAMELY, THE RISK WORKING GROUP AND THE

MARKETS COMMITTEE. THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES

ARE COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM,

INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF LINE OF BUSINESS, RISK

MANAGEMENT, FINANCE AND OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES.

MEMBERS OF THESE RISK COMMITTEES MEET FREQUENTLY TO

DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING, FOR

EXAMPLE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER

EXTERNAL EVENTS, CURRENT RISK EXPOSURES AND

CONCENTRATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPACT OF CURRENT

RISK FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED BROADLY ACROSS THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES.

THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OVERSEES GLOBAL

MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY

JPMORGAN CHASE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT THAT FALL

OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND

OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

APPROVING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY, INCLUDING

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANNING AND EXPOSURE TO SPES

(AND ANY REQUIRED LIQUIDITY SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF

SUCH SPES). THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE ALSO

OVERSEES THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND FUNDS

TRANSFER PRICING POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF

BUSINESS TRANSFER INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK TO TREASURY IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

SEGMENT).

THE RISK WORKING GROUP MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW

ISSUES SUCH AS RISK POLICY, RISK METHODOLOGY, BASEL

II AND REGULATORY ISSUES AND TOPICS REFERRED TO IT

BY ANY LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE. THE MARKETS

COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER,

MEETS AT LEAST WEEKLY TO REVIEW AND DETERMINE APPROPRIATE

COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISK

MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIMITS;

CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK; LARGE, HIGH

RISK TRANSACTIONS; AND HEDGING STRATEGIES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF

RISK MANAGEMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARDS

RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE RISK

POLICY COMMITTEE OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT

RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING

MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE

POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF

GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE PROCESS BY

WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN.

IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS

WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL

OF LIQUIDITY IS CRUCIAL TO FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE

LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY DURING PERIODS OF ADVERSE

CONDITIONS. THE FIRMS FUNDING STRATEGY IS TO

ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND DIVERSITY OF FUNDING SOURCES

TO MEET ACTUAL AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THROUGH

BOTH STABLE AND ADVERSE CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES A CENTRALIZED APPROACH FOR

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT. GLOBAL FUNDING IS

MANAGED BY CORPORATE TREASURY, USING REGIONAL

EXPERTISE AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

A CENTRALIZED FRAMEWORK MAXIMIZES LIQUIDITY ACCESS,

MINIMIZES FUNDING COSTS AND PERMITS IDENTIFICATION

AND COORDINATION OF GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RISK.

RECENT EVENTS

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008, GLOBAL MARKETS

EXHIBITED EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AND

INCREASING SIGNS OF STRESS. THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD,

ACCESS BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO THE DEBT, EQUITY,

AND CONSUMER LOAN SECURITIZATION MARKETS WAS

CONSTRAINED AND FUNDING SPREADS WIDENED SHARPLY. IN

RESPONSE TO STRAINS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY AGENCIES INTRODUCED

VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO INJECT LIQUIDITY INTO THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM. JPMORGAN CHASE PARTICIPATED IN A

NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS, TWO OF WHICH WERE THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM AND THE FDICS TLG

PROGRAM. ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED

$25.0 BILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK AS WELL AS A

WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO 88,401,697 SHARES OF THE

FIRMS COMMON STOCK TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH ENHANCED THE FIRMS

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, ON

DECEMBER 4, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO

CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FDICS TLG PROGRAM,

WHICH FACILITATED LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES AT RATES

(INCLUDING THE GUARANTEE FEE CHARGED BY THE FDIC)

MORE FAVORABLE THAN THOSE FOR NON-FDIC GUARANTEED

DEBT ISSUANCES. UNDER THE TLG PROGRAM, THE FDIC

GUARANTEES CERTAIN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OF

JPMORGAN CHASE, AND IN RETURN FOR THE GUARANTEES,

THE FDIC IS PAID A FEE BASED ON THE AMOUNT AND

MATURITY OF THE DEBT. UNDER THE TLG PROGRAM, THE

FDIC WILL PAY THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

AN FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT INSTRUMENT UPON THE UNCURED

FAILURE OF THE PARTICIPATING ENTITY TO MAKE A

TIMELY PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INSTRUMENT. DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, PURSUANT TO THE TLG

PROGRAM, THE FIRM ISSUED $20.8 BILLION OF BONDS

GUARANTEED BY THE FDIC, FURTHER ENHANCING THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

ALL OF THE FDIC-GUARANTEED DEBT

WAS OUTSTANDING AND HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $21.0

BILLION, NET OF HEDGES. IN THE INTEREST OF

PROMOTING DEPOSIT STABILITY, DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER, THE FDIC ALSO (I) TEMPORARILY INCREASED,

THROUGH 2009, INSURANCE COVERAGE ON BANK DEPOSITS

TO $250,000 PER CUSTOMER FROM $100,000 PER

CUSTOMER, AND (II) FOR QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS WHO

PARTICIPATED IN THE TLG PROGRAM (SUCH AS THE FIRM),

PROVIDED FULL DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008, THE FIRMS

DEPOSITS (EXCLUDING THOSE ASSUMED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION) INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY, AS THE FIRM BENEFITED FROM THE

HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND CREDIT CONCERNS

AFFECTING THE MARKETS.

ON MAY 30, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED THE

MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF

THE TRANSACTION AND THE DE-RISKING OF POSITIONS

OVER TIME, THE MERGER WITH BEAR STEARNS HAD NO

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. ON

SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE

BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE

FDIC. AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSUMED WASHINGTON MUTUALS DEPOSITS

AS WELL AS ITS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION-RELATED MASTER TRUSTS, COVERED

BONDS, AND LIABILITIES TO CERTAIN FEDERAL HOME LOAN

BANKS. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION HAD AN

INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS OVERALL

LIQUIDITY POSITION.

BOTH S&P AND MOODYS LOWERED THE FIRMS RATINGS ONE

NOTCH ON DECEMBER 19, 2008 AND JANUARY 15, 2009,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE RATING ACTIONS DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF

FUNDING TO THE FIRM. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

CREDIT RATINGS, SEE THE CREDIT RATINGS CAPTION OF

THIS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION ON PAGES 79-80 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE MARKET EVENTS DURING THE LATTER

HALF OF 2008, THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION

REMAINED STRONG BASED ON ITS LIQUIDITY METRICS AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS

SUFFICIENT TO MEET ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

OBLIGATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED FUNDING,

INCLUDING CORE LIABILITIES, EXCEEDED ILLIQUID

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, DURING THE COURSE OF 2008, THE

FIRM RAISED FUNDS AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IN

EXCESS OF ITS MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO COVER ITS

OBLIGATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES

THAT MATURE OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

GOVERNANCE

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE APPROVES AND OVERSEES

THE EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. CORPORATE TREASURY

FORMULATES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY AND CONTINGENCY

PLANNING STRATEGIES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE.

LIQUIDITY MONITORING

THE FIRM MONITORS LIQUIDITY TRENDS, TRACKS

HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE ON- AND OFF-BALANCE

SHEET LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS, IDENTIFIES AND

MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY WARNING

SIGNALS TO PERMIT EARLY DETECTION OF LIQUIDITY

ISSUES, AND MANAGES CONTINGENCY PLANNING

(INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION AND TESTING OF VARIOUS

COMPANY-SPECIFIC AND MARKET-DRIVEN STRESS

SCENARIOS). VARIOUS TOOLS, WHICH TOGETHER

CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERALL FIRMWIDE LIQUIDITY

PERSPECTIVE, ARE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE

LIQUIDITY. AMONG OTHERS, THESE INCLUDE: (I)

ANALYSIS OF THE TIMING OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES VERSUS

LIQUIDITY USES (I.E., FUNDING GAPS) OVER PERIODS

RANGING FROM OVERNIGHT TO ONE YEAR; (II) MANAGEMENT

OF DEBT AND CAPITAL ISSUANCES TO ENSURE THAT THE

ILLIQUID PORTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET CAN BE FUNDED

BY EQUITY, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL

DEBT SECURITIES AND DEPOSITS THE FIRM BELIEVES TO

BE STABLE; AND (III) ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS

CAPACITY TO RAISE INCREMENTAL UNSECURED AND SECURED

FUNDING.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES. AT THE PARENT

HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, LONG-TERM FUNDING IS MANAGED

TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY HAS, AT A

MINIMUM, SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER ITS

OBLIGATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES

WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES,

THE FOCUS OF LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS ON

MAINTENANCE OF UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING

CAPACITY SUFFICIENT TO MEET ON- AND OFF-BALANCE

SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

A COMPONENT OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THE FIRMS

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE GOAL OF THE PLAN IS

TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY DURING NORMAL AND

STRESS PERIODS. THE PLAN CONSIDERS VARIOUS

TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS WHERE

ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS SEVERELY LIMITED OR

NONEXISTENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ON-AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, AND SEPARATELY

EVALUATES ACCESS TO FUNDS BY THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANY AND THE FIRMS BANKS.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

THE DEPOSITS HELD BY THE RFS, CB, TSS AND AM LINES

OF BUSINESS ARE A GENERALLY CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

FUNDING FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE

$1.0 TRILLION, COMPARED WITH $740.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

FIRMS DEPOSITS ARE RETAIL DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE LESS

SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES OR MARKET

VOLATILITY AND THEREFORE ARE CONSIDERED MORE STABLE

THAN MARKET-BASED (I.E., WHOLESALE) LIABILITY

BALANCES. THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ADDED

APPROXIMATELY $159.9 BILLION OF DEPOSITS TO THE

FIRM, A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE RETAIL

DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM SUBSTANTIAL

LIABILITY BALANCES ORIGINATED BY RFS, CB, TSS AND AM.

THESE FRANCHISE-GENERATED LIABILITY BALANCES

INCLUDE DEPOSITS AND FUNDS THAT ARE SWEPT TO

ON-BALANCE SHEET LIABILITIES (E.G., COMMERCIAL

PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES

LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCES OF FUNDING DUE TO THE

NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FROM WHICH

THEY ARE GENERATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF

DEPOSIT AND LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE THE

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE FIRMS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS AND THE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES

4260 AND 6466, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDE A VARIETY OF

UNSECURED SHORT-AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, CERTIFICATES OF

DEPOSITS, TIME DEPOSITS, BANK NOTES, COMMERCIAL

PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK AND COMMON STOCK.

SECURED SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDE SECURITIES

LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, ASSET

SECURITIZATIONS, BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVE (INCLUDING DISCOUNT WINDOW BORROWINGS, THE

PRIMARY DEALER CREDIT FACILITY AND THE TERM AUCTION

FACILITY) AND BORROWINGS FROM THE CHICAGO,

PITTSBURGH AND, AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION, THE SAN FRANCISCO FEDERAL HOME

LOAN BANKS. HOWEVER, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW

BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS A PRIMARY

MEANS OF FUNDING THE FIRM.

ISSUANCE

FUNDING MARKETS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS

TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE GLOBAL BALANCE OF

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING AT FAVORABLE RATES.

GENERATING FUNDING FROM A BROAD RANGE OF SOURCES IN

A VARIETY OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ENHANCES

FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON ANY

ONE SOURCE.

DURING 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY

$42.6 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT FOR FUNDING OR

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, INCLUDING $20.8

BILLION OF FDIC-GUARANTEED NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE

TLG PROGRAM. THE FIRM ALSO ISSUED $28.0 BILLION OF

IB STRUCTURED NOTES, THE ISSUANCES OF WHICH ARE

GENERALLY CLIENT-DRIVEN AND NOT FOR FUNDING OR

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AS THE PROCEEDS FROM

SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY USED TO PURCHASE

SECURITIES TO MITIGATE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

STRUCTURED NOTE EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, DURING THE

YEAR, THE FIRM ISSUED $1.8 BILLION OF TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. DURING THE SAME

PERIOD, THE FIRM REDEEMED OR HAD MATURITIES OF

$62.7 BILLION OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING $35.8

BILLION OF IB STRUCTURED NOTES.

PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCES INCLUDED $6.0 BILLION AND

$1.8 BILLION OF NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK ISSUED ON APRIL 23 AND AUGUST 21, 2008,

RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED TO

THE U.S. TREASURY ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, UNDER THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH

PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCE UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM, THE FIRM ALSO ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY

ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, A WARRANT TO PURCHASE UP TO

88,401,697 SHARES OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, AT AN

EXERCISE PRICE OF $42.42 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN ANTIDILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. THE

FIRM HAS IN THE PAST, AND MAY CONTINUE IN THE

FUTURE, TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME ITS DEBT OR

TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES IN OPEN

MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND CONTRACTUAL

RESTRICTIONS.

FINALLY, DURING 2008, THE FIRM SECURITIZED $21.4

BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE ABILITY TO

SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED GAINS ON THOSE

SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY

DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ASSETS SECURITIZED AS WELL

AS UPON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE

VOLATILITY AND STRESS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2008, THE FIRM DID NOT

SECURITIZE ANY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AUTO

LOANS OR STUDENT LOANS DURING 2008.

REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN OF ITS

TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND

NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, THE FIRM

ENTERED INTO REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS (RCCS)

GRANTING CERTAIN RIGHTS TO THE HOLDERS OF COVERED

DEBT, AS DEFINED IN THE RCCS, THAT PROHIBIT THE

REPAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR PURCHASE OF THE TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND NONCUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK EXCEPT, WITH LIMITED

EXCEPTIONS, TO THE EXTENT THAT JPMORGAN CHASE HAS

RECEIVED, IN EACH SUCH CASE, SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN QUALIFYING

SECURITIES. CURRENTLY THE FIRMS COVERED DEBT IS

ITS 5.875% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST

DEBENTURES, SERIES O, DUE IN 2035. FOR MORE

INFORMATION REGARDING THESE COVENANTS, REFERENCE IS

MADE TO THE RESPECTIVE RCCS ENTERED INTO BY THE

FIRM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCES OF SUCH TRUST

CASH FLOWS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND

2006, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS DECREASED $13.2

BILLION, $268 MILLION, AND INCREASED

$3.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND

TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASES CASH

FLOWS DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

SUPPORT THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE

OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE.

THE OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE

TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE

AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, MARKET

CONDITIONS AND TRADING STRATEGIES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE

CASH BALANCES AND THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE

CASH THROUGH SHORT-AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE

SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE FIRMS OPERATING LIQUIDITY

NEEDS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, NET CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $23.1 BILLION,

WHILE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$110.6 BILLION AND $49.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN

2008, NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME,

LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR OPERATING

ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION, AND CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE. DURING

2006, 2007 AND 2008,

CASH WAS USED TO FUND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE,

PRIMARILY IN IB AND RFS. DURING 2008, PROCEEDS

FROM SALES OF LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN

INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN

CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS; BUT THE CASH FLOWS

FROM THESE ACTIVITIES WERE AT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

LEVEL THAN FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2007 AND 2006 AS

A RESULT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN 2007 AND

2006, CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS WAS SLIGHTLY

HIGHER THAN PROCEEDS FROM SALES.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE

NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED

GROWTH IN THE FIRMS LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITIES. IN 2007, WHEN COMPARED WITH 2006, THERE

WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CASH FLOWS FROM IB

LOAN ORIGINATIONS/PURCHASES AND SALE/SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFICULT WHOLESALE

SECURITIZATION MARKET AND CAPITAL MARKETS FOR

LEVERAGED FINANCINGS, WHICH WERE AFFECTED BY A

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN LIQUIDITY IN THE

SECOND HALF OF 2007. CASH FLOWS IN 2007 ASSOCIATED

WITH RFS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES GREW,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ORIGINATIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY

INCLUDE ORIGINATING LOANS TO BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT,

OTHER RECEIVABLES, THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENT VEHICLES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2008, NET CASH OF $286.3 BILLION WAS USED IN

INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FOR: PURCHASES OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN CORPORATES AFS PORTFOLIO

TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS TO MAKE STRATEGIC

LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS; INCREASED DEPOSITS WITH

BANKS AS THE RESULT OF THE AVAILABILITY OF EXCESS

CASH FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES

THROUGH INTER-BANK LENDING, AND FROM DEPOSITS WITH

THE FEDERAL RESERVE (WHICH IS NOW AN INVESTING

ACTIVITY, REFLECTING A POLICY CHANGE OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE TO PAY INTEREST TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

ON RESERVE BALANCES); NET ADDITIONS TO THE

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, FROM ORGANIC GROWTH IN

CB; ADDITIONS TO THE CONSUMER PRIME MORTGAGE

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO RETAIN,

RATHER THAN SELL, NEW ORIGINATIONS OF NONCONFORMING

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS; AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES

PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS REFLECTING GROWTH

IN DEMAND FROM CLIENTS FOR LIQUIDITY; AND NET

PURCHASES OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM

MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH A

TEMPORARY FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON LENDING

FACILITY. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE USES OF CASH

WERE PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF AFS

SECURITIES; LOAN SALES AND CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WERE AT A LOWER

LEVEL THAN FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2007 AS A RESULT

OF THE ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS THAT HAVE

CONTINUED SINCE THE LAST HALF OF 2007; AND NET CASH

RECEIVED FROM ACQUISITIONS AND THE SALE OF AN

INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY, IN JUNE 2008, IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER

WITH BEAR STEARNS, THE FIRM SOLD ASSETS ACQUIRED

FROM BEAR STEARNS TO THE FRBNY AND RECEIVED CASH

PROCEEDS OF $28.85 BILLION (FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGE 123128 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT).

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, NET CASH OF

$73.1 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,

PRIMARILY TO FUND PURCHASES IN THE AFS SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE MOVEMENTS; NET ADDITIONS TO THE WHOLESALE

RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIOS IN IB, CB AND AM, MAINLY

AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS GROWTH; A NET INCREASE IN

THE CONSUMER RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING GROWTH IN RFS IN HOME EQUITY LOANS AND

NET ADDITIONS TO RFS SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS

PORTFOLIO (WHICH WAS AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS

DECISION IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO RETAIN (RATHER

THAN SELL) NEW SUBPRIME MORTGAGES), AND GROWTH IN

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS AND AM THAT

CANNOT BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR U.S.

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES; AND INCREASES IN

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AS A

RESULT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF CASH THAT WAS AVAILABLE

FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO BUILD

LIQUIDITY. THESE NET USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND

MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES; AND CREDIT CARD,

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, STUDENT AND WHOLESALE LOAN

SALES AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH GREW IN

2007 DESPITE THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, NET CASH OF

$99.6 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. NET

CASH WAS INVESTED TO FUND NET ADDITIONS TO THE

RETAINED WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MAINLY RESULTING

FROM CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY IN IB LEVERAGED

FINANCINGS; INCREASES IN CS LOANS REFLECTING STRONG

ORGANIC GROWTH; NET ADDITIONS IN RETAIL HOME EQUITY

LOANS; THE ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIOS FROM KOHLS, BP AND PIER 1 IMPORTS,

INC.; THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING

SERVICES; AND PURCHASES OF AFS SECURITIES IN

CONNECTION WITH REPOSITIONING THE PORTFOLIO IN

RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THESE USES

OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS

PROVIDED FROM CREDIT CARD, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE,

AUTO AND

WAS CAUSED PARTIALLY BY MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO

DE-EMPHASIZE VEHICLE LEASING; AND THE SALE OF THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND

QUARTER.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECT

CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, ISSUANCES

OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES, AND ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED AND COMMON

STOCK. IN 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING

ACTIVITIES WAS $250.5 BILLION DUE TO: GROWTH IN

WHOLESALE DEPOSITS, IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST-AND

NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS IN TSS (DRIVEN BY BOTH

NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS, AND DUE TO THE DEPOSIT

INFLOWS RELATED TO THE HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND

CREDIT

CONCERNS AFFECTING THE GLOBAL MARKETS), AS WELL AS

INCREASES IN AM AND CB (DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH);

PROCEEDS OF

$25.0 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK

AND A WARRANT TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM; ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF

COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK USED FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE PURPOSES; AN INCREASE IN OTHER BORROWINGS

DUE TO NONRECOURSE SECURED ADVANCES FROM THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON TO FUND THE PURCHASE

OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM MONEY MARKET

MUTUAL FUNDS; INCREASES IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED

AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH HIGHER SHORT-TERM

REQUIREMENTS TO FULFILL CLIENT DEMAND FOR LIQUIDITY

AND FINANCE THE FIRMS AFS SECURITIES INVENTORY;

AND A NET INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO A

COMBINATION OF NON-FDIC GUARANTEED DEBT AND TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED PRIOR TO

DECEMBER

4, 2008, AND THE ISSUANCE OF $20.8 BILLION OF

FDIC-GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE FOURTH-QUARTER

FDIC-GUARANTEED ISSUANCE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

MATURITIES OF NON-FDIC GUARANTEED LONG-TERM DEBT

DURING THE SAME PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM

DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

WAS USED PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS

HELD BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND BUILD

LIQUIDITY. CASH WAS ALSO USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. THE FIRM DID NOT

REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE

OPEN MARKET DURING 2008 IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS

CAPITAL OBJECTIVES.

IN 2007, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES

WAS $183.0 BILLION DUE TO A NET INCREASE IN

WHOLESALE DEPOSITS FROM GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES,

IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AT TSS, AM

AND CB;

NET ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN

ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY

AND BUILD LIQUIDITY, AND BY IB FROM CLIENT-DRIVEN

STRUCTURED NOTES TRANSACTIONS; AND GROWTH IN

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

DUE TO GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES

IN SWEEP ACCOUNTS IN TSS AND CB, AND TO FUND

TRADING POSITIONS AND TO FURTHER BUILD LIQUIDITY.

CASH WAS USED TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND PAY

DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN

THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2007.

IN 2006, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES

WAS $152.7 BILLION DUE TO NET CASH RECEIVED FROM

GROWTH IN DEPOSITS, REFLECTING NEW RETAIL ACCOUNT

ACQUISITIONS AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF THE

RETAIL BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; HIGHER

WHOLESALE BUSINESS VOLUMES; INCREASES IN SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO FUND TRADING

POSITIONS AND HIGHER AFS SECURITIES POSITIONS; AND

NET ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED WAS

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS

ON STOCK AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE

INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE

RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF

FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS

AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR

VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES

AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES ON PAGES 6768 AND RATINGS PROFILE OF

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MARKED TO MARKET (MTM) ON

PAGE 88 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS

INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM,

STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES,

AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF THE FIRMS SIGNIFICANT BANKING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ON DECEMBER 19, 2008, S&P LOWERED THE SENIOR

LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND

ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ONE NOTCH FROM

AA- AND AA, RESPECTIVELY; LOWERED THE

SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FROM

A-1+; AND AFFIRMED THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF

ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THESE ACTIONS WERE

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF S&PS BELIEF THAT THE

FIRMS EARNINGS ARE LIKELY TO DECLINE OVER THE NEXT

COUPLE OF YEARS IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING LOAN

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO

CONSUMER LENDING, AS WELL AS DECLINING BUSINESS

VOLUMES. S&PS CURRENT OUTLOOK IS NEGATIVE. ON

JANUARY 15, 2009, MOODYS LOWERED THE SENIOR

LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND

ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES FROM AA2 AND

AAA, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ACTIONS WERE PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF MOODYS VIEW THAT, IN THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE

DIFFICULTIES GENERATING CAPITAL AND COULD FACE

SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS PRESSURE. MOODYS AFFIRMED THE

SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE &

CO. AND ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES AT P-1.

MOODYS ALSO REVISED THE OUTLOOK TO STABLE FROM

NEGATIVE DUE TO THE FIRMS STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS,

SIGNIFICANT LOAN LOSS RESERVES, AND STRONG

FRANCHISE. RATINGS FROM FITCH ON JPMORGAN CHASE &

CO. AND ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES REMAINED

UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND FITCHS

OUTLOOK REMAINED STABLE. THE RECENT RATING ACTIONS

BY S&P AND MOODYS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING. IF THE

FIRMS SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE

DOWNGRADED BY ONE ADDITIONAL NOTCH, THE FIRM

BELIEVES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF FUNDS OR LOSS OF FUNDING WOULD BE

MANAGEABLE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY RESOURCES. JPMORGAN CHASES UNSECURED

DEBT, OTHER THAN IN CERTAIN CASES THE IB STRUCTURED NOTES, DOES NOT CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL

FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR

CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, NOR

CONTAIN COLLATERAL PROVISIONS OR THE CREATION OF AN

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATION, BASED ON

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS,

FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR STOCK

PRICE. TO THE EXTENT ANY IB STRUCTURED NOTES DO CONTAIN SUCH

PROVISIONS, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCELERATION

OF PAYMENTS OR MATURITIES OR PROVISION OF COLLATERAL, THE SECURITIES

USED BY THE FIRM TO RISK MANAGE SUCH STRUCTURED NOTES, TOGETHER WITH

OTHER LIQUIDITY RESOURCES, ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE FUNDS SUFFICIENT

TO SATISFY THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT (FOR

EXAMPLE, THROUGH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

AND DERIVATIVES) TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, FROM

LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO THE

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER. FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS,

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION OF

SYNDICATED LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE FIRM INTO THE

MARKETPLACE (PRIMARILY TO IB CLIENTS), WITH

EXPOSURE HELD IN THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO AVERAGING

LESS THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL ORIGINATED LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS GENERATED BY CB AND AM ARE

GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. WITH

REGARD TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET, THE FIRM

FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED

FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE.

LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE BEING EMPLOYED FOR ALL

HOME LENDING PORTFOLIOS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE

RATE REDUCTIONS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, FORBEARANCE

AND OTHER ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE THE ECONOMIC

LOSS AND AVOID FORECLOSURE. IN THE MORTGAGE

BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE EITHER RETAINED IN

THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO OR SECURITIZED AND SOLD TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF

RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF

BUSINESS. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, INCLUDING

TRANSACTION AND LINE APPROVAL



ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL

CREDIT EXPOSURE



MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES



CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT

RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING

AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. THE CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING

EXPOSURES ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL

METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR

MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER

INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK

MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS

AND CREDIT BUREAU SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK

RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION

PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS

CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK

MEASUREMENT IS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN

A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED UPON THESE FACTORS AND

RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES

BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE

WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE LOSSES,

REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ARE

BASED PRIMARILY UPON STATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF

CREDIT LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE

NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE

ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD

BE FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL

AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED

LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF

ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF

LOSSES. RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A RISK-RATED

BASIS; FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS ASSESSED

PRIMARILY ON A CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED (GENERALLY HELD

IN IB, CB, TSS AND AM), PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED

LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED UPON ESTIMATES OF

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT.

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE EXPECTED DEFAULT

CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT

IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT AND

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL

SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL

REVIEW. RISK RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE

RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ARE REVIEWED ON AN

ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND

REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO REFLECT THE BORROWERS

CURRENT RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL

AND STRUCTURAL POSITIONS.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS

AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED UPON A STATISTICAL

ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS

OF TIME. PROBABLE LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING

SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING

AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS

AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION,

COMMON MEASURES OF CREDIT QUALITY DERIVED FROM

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO PREDICT

CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS

EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE

PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION SOURCES,

PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING

CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHARGE-OFF POLICIES.

THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT

PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE DELINQUENCIES AND

SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

PROBABLE LOSSES. THESE FACTORS AND ANALYSES ARE

UPDATED AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE

FREQUENTLY AS MARKET CONDITIONS DICTATE.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT

ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION MAKING OF

EXTENDING CREDIT AND ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE CREDIT

RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY,

MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH

THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY

FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES,

CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES,

PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR

MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURE. WHOLESALE CREDIT

RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER

BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE

IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING

LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER

RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE FURTHER

DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING RISK SECTIONS. FOR

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS ITEMS ARE

TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL,

WHEREBY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH

CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO

GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND

INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND

DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT

QUALITY FORECASTS, CONCENTRATIONS LEVELS AND RISK

PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO

REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE

APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT

EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED

WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION,

SEE PAGE 74 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2008 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

DURING 2008, CREDIT MARKETS EXPERIENCED

DETERIORATION AND INCREASED DEFAULTS AND DOWNGRADES

REFLECTING,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED LIQUIDITY. THE

LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT CRISIS HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED

MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, RESULTING IN THE

FAILURE OF SOME IN BOTH THE U.S. AND EUROPE, AND

HAS IMPACTED THE FUNCTIONING OF CREDIT MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY, THE LOAN SYNDICATION AND ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIZATION MARKETS. THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO

WAS AFFECTED BY THESE MARKET CONDITIONS AND

EXPERIENCED DETERIORATING CREDIT QUALITY,

ESPECIALLY IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR,

GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE MARKET. IN 2008, FOR

THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, CRITICIZED ASSETS AND NPAS

INCREASED, FROM HISTORICAL LOWS, 301% AND 525%,

RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. CHARGE-OFFS,

WHICH TYPICALLY LAG OTHER PORTFOLIO DETERIORATION,

HAVE INCREASED FROM HISTORICAL LOWS BY 458% OVER

2007. THE FIRM HAS REMAINED FOCUSED ON AGGRESSIVELY

MANAGING THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH

REVIEWS OF CREDIT QUALITY, AS WELL AS OF REVISIONS

OF INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS.

RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE

FIRMS RISK TOLERANCE.

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING

HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED, CONSISTENT WITH EVOLVING

MARKET CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO

LEND IN A SAFE AND PRUDENT MANNER. IN LIGHT OF THE

CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED

TO 2.64%, FROM 1.67% AT THE END OF 2007.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CREDIT PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO

BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT,

PARTICULARLY THE WEAK LABOR MARKET AND THE DECLINE

IN HOUSING PRICES WHICH OCCURRED NATIONALLY. AS A

RESULT, THE FIRM TOOK ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

TO REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE BY TIGHTENING UNDERWRITING

AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS IN THOSE MARKETS

MOST AFFECTED BY THE HOUSING DOWNTURN. IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED PLANS TO

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS

RELATED TO ITS MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIOS.

DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD OF THESE EXPANDED

LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS, WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IN

PLACE IN EARLY 2009, THE FIRM DID NOT PLACE LOANS

INTO FORECLOSURE. THESE LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE

EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN THE

BALANCE OF MODIFIED LOANS CARRIED ON THE FIRMS

BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AS

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, WHILE MINIMIZING THE

ECONOMIC LOSS TO THE FIRM AND ASSISTING HOMEOWNERS

TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS JPMORGAN CHASES

CREDIT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

INCREASED $198.8 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE OF $115.0 BILLION IN THE

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND $83.8 BILLION IN THE

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL

CREDIT EXPOSURE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTS $319.2

BILLION AND $54.3 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL CREDIT EXPOSURE ACQUIRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STEARNS TRANSACTIONS,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPOSURE FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION CONSISTED OF $271.7 BILLION IN THE

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO AND $47.5 BILLION IN THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL

LENDING. THE EXPOSURE FROM THE BEAR STEARNS ACQUISITION WAS INCLUDED

IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. EXCLUDING THESE TWO

TRANSACTIONS, THERE WAS A DECREASE OF $174.7 BILLION

IN OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE, WHICH WAS LARGELY

DRIVEN BY DECREASES IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AND MANAGED LOANS.

WHILE OVERALL PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE DECLINED WHEN

EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STEARNS

TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM PROVIDED OVER $150 BILLION

IN NEW LOANS AND LINES OF CREDIT TO RETAIL AND

WHOLESALE CLIENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES,

LARGE CORPORATIONS, NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS,

STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

IN THE TABLE BELOW, REPORTED LOANS INCLUDE LOANS

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND LOANS

HELD-FOR-SALE, WHICH ARE CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN

NONINTEREST REVENUE. HOWEVER, THESE HELD-FOR-SALE

LOANS AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ARE

EXCLUDED FROM THE AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES USED FOR

THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE CALCULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE

(IB, CB, TSS AND AM) INCREASED $83.8 BILLION FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER, WHICH ADDED $54.3 BILLION OF WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 ($26.0 BILLION OF

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS, $18.9 BILLION OF

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, $5.0 BILLION OF

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND $4.4 BILLION OF

LOANS) AND THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION (WHICH

ADDED $47.5 BILLION OF WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2008, MAINLY CONSISTING OF LOANS).

EXCLUDING THESE TWO TRANSACTIONS,

THE PORTFOLIO DECREASED $18.0 BILLION, LARGELY

DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF $73.7 BILLION IN

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND $9.9 BILLION IN

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS. PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE

DECREASES WAS AN INCREASE OF $65.5 BILLION IN

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THE DECREASE IN

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS LARGELY RELATED TO

A REDUCTION IN MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THE INCREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN INTEREST

RATES, WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS AND VOLATILE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES REFLECTED IN INTEREST RATE, CREDIT

AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES, RESPECTIVELY. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CONDUIT-RELATED

COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 177186 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STEARNS

TRANSACTIONS, RETAINED LOANS INCREASED $11.0

BILLION REFLECTING INCREASES IN TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITY WHILE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR

VALUE DECREASED REFLECTING SALES, REDUCED CARRYING VALUES

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL

INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT

EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIES THE FIRM CONTINUES

TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT

CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE

TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE PRECEDING PAGE.



REAL ESTATE: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY GREW IN 2008 DUE TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THIS INCREASE CONSISTING OF

EXPOSURE TO MULTI-FAMILY LENDING. APPROXIMATELY 45% OF THE REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE IS TO LARGE REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AND

INSTITUTIONS (E.G. REITS), PROFESSIONAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS, OWNERS, OR SERVICE

PROVIDERS, AND GENERALLY INVOLVES REAL ESTATE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY TENANTS. COMMERCIAL

CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 13% OF THE REAL ESTATE

PORTFOLIO AT 2008 YEAR-END. EXPOSURE TO NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOMEBUILDERS

DECREASED BY 31% FROM 2007 AND REPRESENTED 5% OF THE PORTFOLIO AT 2008 YEAR-END. THE INCREASE

IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES TO SELECT NAMES WITHIN THE

PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY IN IB, REFLECTING THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. THE REMAINING

INCREASE IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE REFLECTED EXPOSURES ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF HIGHER DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL BANKS DUE TO HIGHER VOLATILITY AND

GREATER TRADE VOLUME AND TO THE ADDITION OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS FROM THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PORTFOLIO THAT IS INVESTMENT GRADE HAS DECLINED SLIGHTLY

FROM 2007 AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT ON FINANCIAL

COUNTERPARTIES. THE GROWTH IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES

TO SPECIALTY FINANCE COMPANIES, REFLECTED IN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.



AUTOMOTIVE: INDUSTRY CONDITIONS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2008, PARTICULARLY IN

NORTH AMERICA, AND ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE IN 2009. THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE

OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE IN THIS SEGMENT IS RELATED TO ORIGINAL

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. HOWEVER, A MAJORITY OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CRITICIZED

EXPOSURE RELATED TO AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS WHICH WERE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION. MOST OF THE FIRMS CRITICIZED EXPOSURE IN

THIS SEGMENT REMAINS PERFORMING AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY SECURED.



ASSET MANAGERS: EXPOSURE IN THIS INDUSTRY GREW FROM 2007 AS A RESULT OF INCREASED

DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE TO PRIMARILY INVESTMENT GRADE FUNDS AND THE

ACQUISITION OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS TO THIS INDUSTRY

DUE TO THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER.



ALL OTHER: ALL OTHER IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION TABLE ON PAGE 85

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED $278.1 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO 17 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

EXPOSURES RELATED TO SPES AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WERE 37% AND 19%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THIS

CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING (GENERALLY BACKED BY RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR

SPES, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 177186 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE

IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND NONE

COMPRISE MORE THAN 2% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS; GENERATE REVENUE THROUGH TRADING

ACTIVITIES; MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS; AND

MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE. THE NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

OUTSTANDING SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED, IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, THE POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE

FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS. FOR MOST DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE

HANDS; IT IS USED SIMPLY AS A REFERENCE TO

CALCULATE PAYMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE

CONTRACTS, SEE NOTE 32 AND NOTE 34 ON PAGES

202205 AND 210211 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE (MTM) OR FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM. THESE AMOUNTS

REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE

CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENTS

VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT

RISK SHOULD ALSO REFLECT ADDITIONAL LIQUID

SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL BY THE FIRM OF $19.8

BILLION AND $9.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN TOTAL EXPOSURE,

NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $142.8 BILLION AND $67.3

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, NET OF

COLLATERAL, INCREASED $75.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN

INTEREST RATES, WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS AND

VOLATILE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES REFLECTED IN

INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

DERIVATIVES, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2008

ALSO INCLUDED POSITIONS ACQUIRED IN THE BEAR

STEARNS MERGER.

THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DELIVERED

BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, AND

ALTHOUGH THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE

BALANCES NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE

AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD

ARISE SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS TRANSACTIONS

MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, THE FIRM HELD $22.2 BILLION AND $17.4

BILLION OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM ALSO

DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS IN THE

FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE,

THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY

OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM

CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT

LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE), AND

AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL

INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS A

MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT

EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF

DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE

EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE

MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED

LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING

OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A

LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY

THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A

LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN

PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM

FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE

OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME

PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG

EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING

PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL

AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AVERAGE EXPOSURE WAS $83.7

BILLION AND

$47.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $142.8

BILLION AND $67.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS

BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND

THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF

CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL

ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING

MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE

RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO

CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE

DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR CORRELATION

BETWEEN THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE

COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT QUALITY WITHIN THE CREDIT

APPROVAL PROCESS. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE

TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS.

THE GRAPH BELOW SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO

DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS CALCULATED

BY THE DRE AND AVG METRICS. THE TWO MEASURES

GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST

YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN NONINVESTMENT GRADE DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES REFLECTS A WEAKENING CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF

COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO

COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS WAS 83% AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM 82% AT DECEMBER

31, 2007.

THE FIRM POSTED $99.1 BILLION AND $33.5

BILLION OF COLLATERAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS

INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY

AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST COLLATERAL FOR

THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. THE IMPACT OF A

SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A., FROM ITS RATING OF AA- TO A+ AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $2.2 BILLION

OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM.

THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE (FROM AA- TO

BBB-) WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $6.4 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR

TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A

DOWNGRADE OF EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY,

AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL CONTRACTS THAT

ISOLATE CREDIT RISK FROM AN UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT

(SUCH AS A LOAN OR SECURITY) AND TRANSFER THAT RISK

FROM ONE PARTY (THE BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION) TO

ANOTHER (THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION). THE FIRM

IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF CREDIT

PROTECTION. AS A PURCHASER OF CREDIT PROTECTION,

THE FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTY PROVIDING

THE CREDIT PROTECTION WILL DEFAULT. AS A SELLER OF

CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM HAS RISK THAT THE

UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT

WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT EVENT. OF THE FIRMS $162.6 BILLION OF TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, $44.7 BILLION, OR 27%, WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE

BENEFIT OF LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL.

ONE TYPE OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES THE FIRM ENTERS INTO WITH COUNTERPARTIES ARE CREDIT

DEFAULTS SWAPS (CDS). FOR

FURTHER DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER

TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 32 ON PAGES

202205 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE LARGE MAJORITY OF CDS ARE SUBJECT TO

COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS TO PROTECT THE FIRM FROM

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. IN 2008, THE FREQUENCY

AND SIZE OF DEFAULTS FOR BOTH TRADING

COUNTERPARTIES AND THE UNDERLYING DEBT REFERENCED

IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES WERE WELL ABOVE

HISTORICAL NORMS. THE USE OF COLLATERAL TO

SETTLE AGAINST DEFAULTING COUNTERPARTIES GENERALLY

PERFORMED AS DESIGNED IN SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATING

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

DURING 2008, THE FIRM WORKED WITH OTHER SIGNIFICANT

MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO DEVELOP MECHANISMS TO REDUCE

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, INCLUDING THE

CANCELLATION OF OFFSETTING TRADES. IN 2009, IT IS

ANTICIPATED THAT ONE OR MORE CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES

FOR CDS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND JPMORGAN CHASE WILL

FACE THESE CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES, OR CLEARING

HOUSES, FOR AN INCREASING

PORTION OF ITS CDS BUSINESS.

THE FIRM USES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST,

IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER IN THE

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS; AND SECOND, IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE

FIRMS OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OVERALL

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL

CREDIT LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED

COMMITMENTS), AS WELL AS ITS EXPOSURE TO

RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRMS NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED

AND SOLD AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS

WITHIN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS, THE FIRM

ACTIVELY UTILIZES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY BUYING AND

SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON

CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, IN RESPONSE TO CLIENT

DEMAND FOR CREDIT RISK PROTECTION ON THE UNDERLYING

REFERENCE INSTRUMENTS. PROTECTION MAY BE BOUGHT OR

SOLD BY THE FIRM ON SINGLE REFERENCE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS (SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DERIVATIVES),

PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCED INSTRUMENTS (PORTFOLIO

CREDIT DERIVATIVES) OR QUOTED INDICES (INDEXED

CREDIT DERIVATIVES). THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY

MATCHED AS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN REFERENCE

ENTITY UNDER A CONTRACT TO SELL PROTECTION TO A

COUNTERPARTY MAY BE OFFSET PARTIALLY, OR ENTIRELY,

WITH A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE PROTECTION FROM ANOTHER

COUNTERPARTY ON THE SAME UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT. ANY

RESIDUAL DEFAULT EXPOSURE AND SPREAD RISK IS

ACTIVELY MANAGED BY THE FIRMS VARIOUS TRADING

DESKS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD INCREASED $421

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2007. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WITH BEAR

STEARNS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF

INDUSTRY EFFORTS TO REDUCE OFFSETTING TRADE

ACTIVITY.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES

IN MANAGING ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE THE FIRM

PURCHASES PROTECTION THROUGH SINGLE-NAME AND

PORTFOLIO CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE CREDIT

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. GAINS OR

LOSSES ON THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE

FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT

QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 133, AND

THEREFORE, EFFECTIVENESS TESTING UNDER SFAS 133 IS

NOT PERFORMED. LOAN INTEREST AND FEES ARE GENERALLY

RECOGNIZED IN NET INTEREST INCOME, AND IMPAIRMENT

IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

THIS ASYMMETRY IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BETWEEN

THAT ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE AMOUNT FOR 2008 AND 2007 INCORPORATES

AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 ON JANUARY 1, 2007.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTIVELY MANAGES WHOLESALE CREDIT

EXPOSURE THROUGH IB AND CB LOAN AND COMMITMENT

SALES. DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, THESE SALES OF

$3.9 BILLION, $4.9 BILLION AND $4.0 BILLION OF

LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTED IN

LOSSES OF $41 MILLION AND $7 MILLION IN 2008 AND

2007 AND GAINS OF $83 MILLION IN 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS INCLUDE GAINS ON SALES

OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 83 OF

WHICH ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR LIQUIDITY AND BALANCE

AND NOTE 16 ON PAGES 7680 AND 168176,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE

$379.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH

$446.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE DECREASE

WAS LARGELY RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN MULTI-SELLER

CONDUIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS. IN THE FIRMS VIEW,

THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS

IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT

RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN

DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE

FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS,

WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT

RISK CAPITAL TO THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE FIRM HAS

ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH

COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF

THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE

THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED UPON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE

EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE

LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $204.3 BILLION AND

$238.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNAL PROCESS

FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING EXPOSURES TO EMERGING

MARKETS COUNTRIES. THERE IS NO COMMON DEFINITION OF

EMERGING MARKETS BUT THE FIRM GENERALLY, THOUGH NOT

EXCLUSIVELY, INCLUDES IN ITS DEFINITION THOSE

COUNTRIES WHOSE SOVEREIGN DEBT RATINGS ARE

EQUIVALENT TO A+ OR LOWER. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY

INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING AND

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR

LOCALLY FUNDED. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING COUNTRY

EXPOSURES, THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE

AND

MANAGE THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH

SOVEREIGN CRISES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO

THE TOP FIVE EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES. THE

SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON THE

FIRMS LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY AND NOT

THE FIRMS VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY

ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS. EXPOSURE IS REPORTED

BASED UPON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS OF THE

OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED.

EXPOSURE AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR COLLATERAL AND

FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G., GUARANTEES AND

LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES;

OUTSTANDINGS SUPPORTED BY A GUARANTOR OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY OR BACKED BY COLLATERAL HELD OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE

ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF

CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES AND OTHER SHORT CREDIT OR

EQUITY TRADING POSITIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE

TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES IN A

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS

PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY

LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, AUTO LOANS, STUDENT LOANS AND

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON

SERVING THE PRIME

CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. THE CONSUMER CREDIT

PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES CERTAIN LOANS ACQUIRED IN

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, PRIMARILY

MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE

RFS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT

AND MORTGAGE LOANS WITH INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT

OPTIONS TO PREDOMINANTLY PRIME BORROWERS, AS WELL

AS CERTAIN PAYMENT OPTION LOANS ACQUIRED FROM

WASHINGTON MUTUAL THAT MAY RESULT IN NEGATIVE

AMORTIZATION.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CONSUMER LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE

IDENTIFIED AS CREDIT-IMPAIRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2008 BASED ON A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE

ACQUIRED PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE, A $1.4 BILLION ACCOUNTING

CONFORMITY PROVISION WAS RECORDED TO REFLECT THE

FIRMS PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES

RELATED TO THE PORTION OF THE ACQUIRED CONSUMER

LOANS THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

CREDIT-IMPAIRED. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

THE ANALYSIS OF ACQUIRED LOANS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY

COMPLETED, RESULTING IN A $12.4

BILLION INCREASE IN THE CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOAN BALANCES AND A

CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN THE NON-CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOAN BALANCES. IN ADDITION, THE ESTIMATE OF

INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO THE NON-CREDIT-IMPAIRED

PORTFOLIO WAS FINALIZED, RESULTING IN A $476

MILLION DECREASE IN THE ACCOUNTING CONFORMITY

PROVISION FOR THESE LOANS. THE PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED AS

IMPAIRED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF RISK

CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE,

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, FICO SCORES AND DELINQUENCY

STATUS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SOP 03-3 AND WERE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SOP 03-3 AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE LOANS

INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO

BE INCURRED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF

THE LOANS, AND THEREFORE NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE

TRANSACTION DATE.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO

ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONSUMER CREDIT PRODUCT SPECTRUM

CONTINUES TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT. HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAKER OVERALL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED

DELINQUENCIES, AND CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES

HAVE DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOSS

SEVERITY. NONPERFORMING LOANS AND ASSETS CONTINUED

TO INCREASE THROUGH YEAR-END 2008, A KEY INDICATOR

THAT CHARGE-OFFS WILL CONTINUE TO RISE IN 2009.

ADDITIONAL DETERIORATION IN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN

THE LABOR MARKET, COULD CAUSE DELINQUENCIES TO

INCREASE BEYOND THE FIRMS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS,

RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN LOSSES IN

2009.

OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE FIRM HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO

REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE BY TIGHTENING BOTH

UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS FOR

REAL ESTATE LENDING, AS WELL AS FOR CONSUMER

LENDING FOR NON-REAL ESTATE PRODUCTS. TIGHTER

INCOME VERIFICATION, MORE CONSERVATIVE COLLATERAL

VALUATION, REDUCED LOAN-TO-VALUE MAXIMUMS AND

HIGHER FICO AND CUSTOM RISK SCORE REQUIREMENTS ARE

JUST SOME OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO DATE TO MITIGATE

RISK. THESE ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTIONS IN NEW ORIGINATIONS OF RISK LAYERED

LOANS (E.G., LOANS WITH HIGH

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS TO BORROWERS WITH LOW FICO

SCORES) AND IMPROVED ALIGNMENT OF LOAN PRICING. NEW

ORIGINATIONS OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, OPTION

ARMS AND BROKER ORIGINATED-MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY

LOANS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED ENTIRELY.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED

PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND LOSS MITIGATION

EFFORTS RELATED TO ITS MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY

PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TO IDENTIFY HOMEOWNERS MOST

IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO OPEN REGIONAL COUNSELING

CENTERS, HIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN COUNSELORS, INTRODUCE

NEW FINANCING ALTERNATIVES, PROACTIVELY REACH OUT

TO BORROWERS TO OFFER PRE-QUALIFIED MODIFICATIONS,

AND COMMENCE A NEW PROCESS TO INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW

$3.3 BILLION FOR DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND $1.5 BILLION FOR DECEMBER 31, 2007; AND (2) STUDENT

LOANS THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM OF $437 MILLION AND $417 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS FOR GNMA AND STUDENT LOANS

ARE EXCLUDED, AS REIMBURSEMENT IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

(I)

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRMS POLICY FOR CLASSIFYING SUBPRIME

MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS AS NONPERFORMING WAS CHANGED TO CONFORM TO ALL THE OTHER

HOME LENDING PRODUCTS. AMOUNTS FOR 2007 HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT

THIS CHANGE.

(J)

NET CHARGE-OFF RATES EXCLUDE AVERAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE OF $2.8 BILLION AND $10.6

BILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM REGULARLY EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS

AND OVERALL ECONOMIC RETURNS AND MAKES AN INITIAL

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER NEW ORIGINATIONS WILL BE

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT OR SOLD WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE. THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE

EXPECTED ECONOMIC RETURNS OF PREVIOUSLY ORIGINATED

LOANS UNDER PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS TO

DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR DESIGNATION AS

HELD-FOR-SALE OR HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO

BE APPROPRIATE. WHEN THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT A

CHANGE IN THIS DESIGNATION IS APPROPRIATE, THE

LOANS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE APPROPRIATE

CLASSIFICATION. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH

QUARTERS OF 2007, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE FIRM DESIGNATED AS

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ALL NEW ORIGINATIONS OF

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, AS WELL AS SUBPRIME

MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED

HELD-FOR-SALE. IN ADDITION, ALL NEW PRIME MORTGAGE

ORIGINATIONS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES

HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT. PRIME

MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159 AND

ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC

LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES WITHIN THE

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO. INFORMATION REGARDING COMBINED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS

(CLTVS) AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS (LTVS) WERE

ESTIMATED BASED ON THE INITIAL APPRAISAL OBTAINED AT THE TIME OF

ORIGINATION, ADJUSTED USING RELEVANT MARKET INDICES FOR HOUSING PRICE

CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE ORIGINATION. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF

THE HOMES COULD VARY FROM ACTUAL MARKET VALUES DUE TO CHANGES IN

CONDITION OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY, VARIATIONS IN HOUSING PRICE

CHANGES WITHIN METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSAS) AND

OTHER FACTORS.

HOME EQUITY.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, WERE $114.3 BILLION, EXCLUDING PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, AN INCREASE OF $19.5 BILLION

FROM YEAR-END 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

ADDITION OF LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION. THE 2008 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

FOR THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NET

INCREASES OF $2.2 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES FOR 2008 FOR THE HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

NOTED ABOVE. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT LOANS WITH EFFECTIVE CLTVS IN EXCESS OF 100%

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 22% OF THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO. IN

RESPONSE TO CONTINUED ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, LOAN

UNDERWRITING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CRITERIA HAVE

BEEN TIGHTENED, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

METROPOLITAN

STATISTICAL AREAS (MSAS) WITH THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT HOUSING PRICE DECLINES. NEW

ORIGINATIONS OF HOME EQUITY LOANS HAVE DECREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY, AS ADDITIONAL LOSS MITIGATION

STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED; THESE STRATEGIES

INCLUDE THE ELIMINATION OF STATED INCOME AND BROKER

ORIGINATED LOANS, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF

MAXIMUM CLTVS FOR

NEW ORIGINATIONS, WHICH NOW RANGE FROM 50% TO 70%,

AND ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON NEW ORIGINATIONS IN

GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST HOUSING

PRICE DEPRECIATION AND HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT. OTHER

LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE REDUCTION OR

CLOSURE OF OUTSTANDING CREDIT LINES FOR BORROWERS

WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CLTVS

OR DECREASES IN CREDITWORTHINESS (E.G. DECLINES IN

FICO SCORES.)

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

WHICH INCLUDE PRIME MORTGAGES, SUBPRIME MORTGAGES,

OPTION ARMS AND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE $96.8

BILLION, EXCLUDING PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS,

REFLECTING A $40.8 BILLION INCREASE FROM YEAR-END

2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE ADDITION OF LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

PRIME MORTGAGES OF $72.5 BILLION INCREASED $31.9

BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2007 AS A RESULT OF LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, ADDITIONAL ORIGINATIONS INTO

THE PORTFOLIO. THE 2008 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

INCLUDES A NET INCREASE OF $1.1 BILLION TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HERITAGE JPMORGAN

CHASE PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT NOTED ABOVE. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT LOANS WITH EFFECTIVE

LTVS IN EXCESS OF 100%

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 18% OF THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM HAS TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS FOR

NONCONFORMING PRIME MORTGAGES IN RECENT QUARTERS,

INCLUDING ELIMINATING STATED INCOME PRODUCTS,

REDUCING LTV MAXIMUMS, AND ELIMINATING THE BROKER

ORIGINATION CHANNEL.

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OF $15.3 BILLION, EXCLUDING

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, DECREASED SLIGHTLY

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, AS THE DISCONTINUATION OF

NEW ORIGINATIONS WAS PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THE

YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDES A

NET INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES FOR THE HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

NOTED ABOVE. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT LOANS WITH EFFECTIVE

LTVS IN EXCESS OF 100% REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 27%

OF THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO.

OPTION ARMS OF $9.0 BILLION, EXCLUDING PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, WERE ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. NEW ORIGINATIONS

OF OPTION ARMS WERE DISCONTINUED BY WASHINGTON

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MUTUAL PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE WASHINGTON

MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THIS PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF LOANS

WITH LOW LTVS AND HIGH BORROWER FICOS AND FOR WHICH

THE FIRM CURRENTLY EXPECTS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER

LOSSES IN COMPARISON WITH THE PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM HAS NOT, AND

DOES NOT, ORIGINATE OPTION ARMS.

OPTION ARMS ARE ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE PRODUCTS

THAT PROVIDE THE BORROWER WITH THE OPTION TO MAKE A

FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY, OR MINIMUM

PAYMENT. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS BASED UPON THE

INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE INTRODUCTORY

PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE IS TYPICALLY WELL

BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED RATE. THE FULLY INDEXED

RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN INDEX RATE PLUS A

MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD ENDS, THE

CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON THE LOAN

INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE. IF THE

BORROWER CONTINUES TO MAKE THE MINIMUM MONTHLY

PAYMENT AFTER THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD ENDS, THE

PAYMENT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER INTEREST

ACCRUED IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH. IN THIS CASE, THE

LOAN WILL NEGATIVELY AMORTIZE AS UNPAID INTEREST

IS DEFERRED AND ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF

THE LOAN. OPTION ARMS TYPICALLY BECOME FULLY

AMORTIZING LOANS UPON REACHING A NEGATIVE

AMORTIZATION CAP OR ON DATES SPECIFIED IN THE

BORROWING AGREEMENT, AT WHICH TIME THE REQUIRED

MONTHLY PAYMENT GENERALLY INCREASES SUBSTANTIALLY.

AUTO LOANS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, AUTO LOANS OF

$42.6 BILLION INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM YEAR-END

2007. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE AUTO

LOAN PORTFOLIO WAS INCREASED DURING 2008,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES DUE TO

AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY AND FURTHER

DETERIORATION OF OLDER VINTAGE LOANS AS A RESULT OF

THE WORSENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND DECLINES IN

AUTO RESALE VALUES. THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO

REFLECTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF PRIME QUALITY

CREDITS. IN RESPONSE TO RECENT INCREASES IN LOAN

DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES, PARTICULARLY IN

MSAS EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST HOUSING PRICE

DEPRECIATION AND HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT, CREDIT

UNDERWRITING CRITERIA HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, WHICH

HAS RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF BOTH EXTENDED-TERM

AND HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE FINANCING.

CREDIT CARD.

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES ITS CREDIT

CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS

THROUGH SECURITIZATION. MANAGED CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES WERE $190.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, AN INCREASE OF $33.3 BILLION FROM YEAR-END

2007, REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF CREDIT CARD

LOANS AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

AS WELL AS ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO.

THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

INCREASED TO 5.01% FOR 2008 FROM 3.68% IN 2007.

THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

CHARGE-OFFS AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS EXPERIENCING THE

GREATEST HOUSING PRICE DEPRECIATION AND HIGHEST

UNEMPLOYMENT. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE

INCREASED TO 4.97% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, FROM 3.48%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE

ADDITION OF CREDIT

CARD LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION. EXCLUDING THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

PORTFOLIO, THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS

4.36%. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS INCREASED

DUE TO HIGHER ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE

PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN

HOUSING MARKETS, ACCOUNT ACQUISITION CREDIT

CRITERIA AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CREDIT PRACTICES

HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PARTICULARLY IN MSAS

EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT HOME PRICE DECLINES. THE

MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT

A WELL-SEASONED, LARGELY REWARDS-BASED PORTFOLIO

THAT HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

ALL OTHER LOANS.

ALL OTHER LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS (WHICH ARE HIGHLY

COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN

GUARANTEES), STUDENT LOANS, AND OTHER SECURED AND

UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

OTHER LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, OF

$35.5 BILLION WERE UP $6.8 BILLION FROM YEAR-END

2007, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ORGANIC GROWTH IN

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND STUDENT LOANS, AS WELL

AS AN INCREASE IN BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AS A

RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS OF $88.8 BILLION IN THE HOME

LENDING PORTFOLIO REPRESENT LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION UNDER SOP

03-3. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE LOANS INCLUDES AN

ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED

OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS,

AND THEREFORE NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS

RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF THE TRANSACTION

DATE. THROUGH YEAR-END 2008, THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE

OF THESE LOANS HAS GENERALLY BEEN CONSISTENT WITH

THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE INITIAL

FAIR VALUE OF THESE LOANS, AND THE FIRMS ORIGINAL

EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

FUTURE CASH FLOWS HAS NOT CHANGED. A PROBABLE

DECREASE IN MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE CASH

COLLECTIONS RELATED TO THESE LOANS COULD RESULT IN

THE NEED TO RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

RELATED TO THESE LOANS IN THE FUTURE. A SIGNIFICANT

AND PROBABLE INCREASE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WOULD

GENERALLY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME

RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

UNDERLYING POOL OF LOANS.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED.

AS PART OF THE RESIDENTIAL

REAL ESTATE FORECLOSURE PROCESS, LOANS ARE WRITTEN

DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE LESS A COST TO SELL

THE ASSET. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM GAINS

TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF INDIVIDUAL

PROPERTIES AT THE COMPLETION OF THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS, THESE OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO)

ASSETS ARE MANAGED FOR PROMPT SALE AND DISPOSITION

AT THE BEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC VALUE. ANY FURTHER

GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE OF THE DISPOSITION OF OREO

ASSETS ARE RECORDED AS PART OF OTHER INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(A)

EXCLUDING THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING

LOSSES WHERE THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN

FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE

FIRM, AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM.

THE ALLOWANCE IS REVIEWED RELATIVE TO THE RISK

PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND IS ADJUSTED IF, IN

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. THE

ALLOWANCE INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC AND A

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

ON PAGES 107111 AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 166168 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB

LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO,

INCLUDING LOSSES THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED OR FOR WHICH THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS

NOT YET BEEN FULLY DETERMINED).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED $13.7

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR TO $23.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE

INCLUDED $4.1 BILLION OF ALLOWANCE RELATED TO NONCREDIT IMPAIRED

LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND THE RELATED

ACCOUNTING CONFORMITY PROVISION. EXCLUDING HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS, LOANS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, AND PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTED

3.62% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED

WITH 1.88% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED

$10.5 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION AND INCREASED

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

AND CREDIT CARD. THE INCREASE INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $4.7 BILLION

DRIVEN BY HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS AS THE WEAK LABOR

MARKET AND WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE

RESULTED IN INCREASED DELINQUENCIES, WHILE

CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES HAVE DRIVEN A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD

INCREASED $4.3 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUIRED ALLOWANCE AND

SUBSEQUENT CONFORMING PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSS

RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK ACQUISITION

AND AN INCREASE IN PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OF

$2.3 BILLION IN 2008 OVER

2007, AS HIGHER ESTIMATED NET-CHARGE OFFS ARE

EXPECTED IN THE PORTFOLIO RESULTING FROM THE

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASE OF

$3.4 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, REFLECTED THE

EFFECT OF A WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND THE

TRANSFER OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED

LEVERAGED LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS

FROM HELD-FOR-SALE.

TO PROVIDE FOR

THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF

EXTENDING CREDIT, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS IS HELD FOR BOTH WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

THE WHOLESALE COMPONENT IS COMPUTED USING A

METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE

LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES

AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN AND HAS AN

ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED

COMPONENT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENT SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 166168 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS FOR

BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER WAS $659 MILLION AND $850

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE REFLECTS THE REDUCTION

IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE PAGE 90 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES WAS DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES LARGELY RELATED TO THE HOME EQUITY, SUBPRIME MORTGAGE, PRIME MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIOS IN THE CONSUMER

BUSINESSES AS WELL AS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO

THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR LOAN

LOSSES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, LOAN GROWTH AND THE

TRANSFER OF $4.9 BILLION OF FUNDED AND UNFUNDED LEVERAGE LENDING COMMITMENTS TO RETAINED LOANS FROM

HELD-FOR-SALE. THE DECREASE IN PROVISION FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

BENEFITED FROM REDUCED BALANCES OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD

LOANS FROM THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY

WASHINGTON MUTUAL (THE TRUST). AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT QUALITY

CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER

OVERALL LOSS RATE REFLECTIVE OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY $400

MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS

INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED

TO THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 169170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE

CHANGE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN MARKET

PRICES OR RATES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND

CONTROLLED BY MARKET RISK, A CORPORATE RISK

GOVERNANCE FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF THE LINES OF

BUSINESS. MARKET RISK SEEKS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT

RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN

OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND MAKE THE FIRMS MARKET

RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS

OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND PERFORMS THE

FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF BUSINESS SEGMENT MARKET RISK



DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS



PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

MARKET RISK WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY MARKET RISKS

THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND DEFINE AND MONITOR

MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALL

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION

AND VERIFICATION OF MARKET RISKS WITHIN THEIR

UNITS. RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT

ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM TRADING PERSONNEL AND ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK EXPOSURES THAT THE

BUSINESS TAKES. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT FOR MARKET RISK ARISING FROM

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MARKET RISK IS ALSO

RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING EXPOSURES WHICH MAY NOT

BE LARGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS BUT

WHICH MAY BE LARGE FOR THE FIRM IN THE AGGREGATE.

REGULAR MEETINGS ARE HELD BETWEEN MARKET RISK AND

THE HEADS OF RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES TO DISCUSS AND

DECIDE ON RISK EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT FLOWS.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK CAN

BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRADING AND

NONTRADING RISK. TRADING RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS

THAT ARE HELD BY THE FIRM AS PART OF A BUSINESS

SEGMENT OR UNIT, THE MAIN BUSINESS STRATEGY OF

WHICH IS TO TRADE OR MAKE MARKETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE

GENERALLY REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK INCLUDES SECURITIES AND

OTHER ASSETS HELD FOR LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT,

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, AND SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS

ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES. UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT

REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TRADING RISK

THE FIRM MAKES MARKETS AND TRADES ITS PRODUCTS

ACROSS SEVERAL DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES. THESE ASSET

CLASSES INCLUDE PRIMARILY FIXED INCOME (WHICH

INCLUDES INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD

RISK), FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES.

TRADING RISK ARISES FROM POSITIONS IN THESE ASSET

CLASSES AND MAY LEAD TO THE POTENTIAL DECLINE IN

NET INCOME (I.E., ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY)

DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES, WHETHER

ARISING FROM CLIENT ACTIVITIES OR PROPRIETARY

POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM.

NONTRADING RISK

NONTRADING RISK ARISES FROM EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS

CORE BUSINESS STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE POSITIONS

THE FIRM UNDERTAKES TO RISK-MANAGE ITS EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG

THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES

AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL AND SHAPE OF MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES ALSO

MAY CREATE INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE REPRICING

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT

NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THE

FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK, WHICH IS THE

DIFFERENCE IN THE REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO

FLOATING-RATE INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND

3-MONTH LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE FIRMS

PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT IMPACT

PRICING AND BALANCES.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO

COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS WELL AS OPTION AND

BASIS RISK. OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM

PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND

CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY ORIGINATED

MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK

RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN

MORTGAGE RATES AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS

OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS, BOTH

STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)



LOSS ADVISORIES



DRAWDOWNS



ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING



EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS

TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT

VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, MARKET VALUES,

POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER.

THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE

FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY

LINE OF BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR

MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND TACTICAL

CONTROL.

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE,

VAR, ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE

MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND

PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF

RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS

USED FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES,

MONITORING LIMITS, AND AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC

CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. VAR PROVIDES RISK

TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT. EACH

BUSINESS DAY THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE

VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES BOTH ITS TRADING AND

ITS NONTRADING RISKS. VAR FOR NONTRADING RISK

MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FAIR

VALUES OF THE EXPOSURES RELATED TO THESE RISKS;

HOWEVER, FOR SUCH RISKS, VAR IS NOT A MEASURE OF

REPORTED REVENUE SINCE NONTRADING ACTIVITIES ARE

GENERALLY NOT MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH NET INCOME.

HEDGES OF NONTRADING ACTIVITIES MAY BE INCLUDED IN

TRADING VAR SINCE THEY ARE MARKED TO MARKET.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL

SIMULATION, BASED ON A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND AN

EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY, WHICH MEASURES RISK

ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT

AND COMPARABLE WAY. THE SIMULATION IS BASED UPON

DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THIS APPROACH

ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES

ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES; THIS IS AN

ASSUMPTION THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ACCURATE,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE VOLATILITY IN THE CURRENT

MARKET ENVIRONMENT. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, AN ACTUAL

PRICE TIME SERIES IS NOT AVAILABLE. IN SUCH CASES,

THE HISTORICAL SIMULATION IS DONE USING A PROXY

TIME SERIES TO ESTIMATE THE RISK. IT IS LIKELY THAT

USING AN ACTUAL PRICE TIME SERIES FOR THESE

PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD IMPACT THE VAR

RESULTS PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN RISK

PARAMETERS, SUCH AS CORRELATION RISK AMONG CERTAIN

IB TRADING INSTRUMENTS, ARE NOT FULLY CAPTURED IN

VAR.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM REVISED ITS

VAR MEASUREMENT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL RISK

POSITIONS PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED FROM VAR, THUS

CREATING, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

VIEW OF ITS MARKET RISKS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

MOVED TO CALCULATING VAR USING A 95% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL TO PROVIDE A MORE STABLE MEASURE OF THE VAR

FOR DAY-TO-DAY RISK MANAGEMENT. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE JPMORGAN CHASES

VAR MEASURES UNDER BOTH THE LEGACY 99% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL AS WELL AS THE NEW 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE

FIRM INTENDS TO SOLELY PRESENT THE VAR AT THE 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL ONCE INFORMATION FOR TWO COMPLETE

YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS IS AVAILABLE.

(B)

AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END VARS WERE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF ITS MARKET RISK

COMPONENTS, WHICH IS DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE

TRADING VAR INCLUDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL TRADING

ACTIVITIES IN IB. BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, THE CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES OF CERTAIN

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS WERE INCLUDED IN TRADING VAR.

THIS CHANGE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT NET IMPACT ON THE

AVERAGE FOURTH QUARTER 2008 VAR. HOWEVER, TRADING

VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE: HELD-FOR-SALE FUNDED LOAN AND

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS POSITIONS (HOWEVER, IT DOES

INCLUDE HEDGES OF THOSE POSITIONS); THE DEBIT

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE

AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE FIRM; THE MSR PORTFOLIO; AND

SECURITIES AND INSTRUMENTS HELD BY CORPORATE

FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. SEE

2008

VAR RESULTS

IBS AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR

WAS $202 MILLION FOR 2008, COMPARED WITH $106

MILLION FOR 2007, AND INCLUDES THE POSITIONS FROM

THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER SINCE MAY 31, 2008. THE

INCREASE IN AVERAGE

AND MAXIMUM VAR DURING 2008 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLATILITY

ACROSS VIRTUALLY ALL ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION,

INCREASED HEDGES OF POSITIONS NOT SPECIFICALLY

CAPTURED IN VAR  FOR EXAMPLE, MACRO HEDGE

STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO MITIGATE THE

CONSEQUENCES OF A SYSTEMIC RISK EVENT AND HEDGES OF

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE  SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE

VAR COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR PERIOD.

FOR 2008, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, AVERAGE

TRADING VAR DIVERSIFICATION INCREASED TO $108

MILLION FROM $77 MILLION, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER. IN GENERAL, OVER THE

COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET

VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS

CHANGE.

VAR

BACKTESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE

FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST

DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS

DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS REVENUE (LESS PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS/LOSSES) PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST

INCOME, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR

OTHER REVENUE. THE DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED

REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES ON HELD-FOR-SALE

FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS AND FROM DVA.

THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY

MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR IB TRADING

BUSINESSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2008. THE CHART SHOWS

THAT IB POSTED MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS ON 165 OF

THE 262 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH 54 DAYS EXCEEDING

$120 MILLION. THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS

ON WHICH IB EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL VAR EXCEEDED

THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. DURING THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED

OF 2008, THE CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES OF

CERTAIN MORTGAGE PRODUCTS). THE FIRM UTILIZES

PROXIES

TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE MORTGAGE AND CREDIT

PRODUCTS SINCE DAILY TIME SERIES ARE LARGELY NOT

MEASURE. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, INCLUDING THESE

ITEMS IN VAR PRODUCES A MORE COMPLETE PERSPECTIVE

OF THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE FOR ITEMS WITH MARKET

RISK THAT CAN IMPACT THE INCOME STATEMENT. THE

CONSUMER LENDING VAR INCLUDES THE FIRMS MORTGAGE

PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED

HEDGES.

THE REVISED VAR MEASURE CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE THE

DVA TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES

TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM. IT ALSO

EXCLUDES CERTAIN NONTRADING ACTIVITY SUCH AS

PRIVATE EQUITY, PRINCIPAL INVESTING (E.G.,

MEZZANINE FINANCING, TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS,

ETC.) AND CORPORATE BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT POSITIONS, AS WELL AS LONGER-TERM

CORPORATE INVESTMENTS. CORPORATE POSITIONS ARE

MANAGED THROUGH THE FIRMS EARNINGS-AT-RISK AND

OTHER CASH FLOW MONITORING PROCESSES RATHER THAN BY

USING A VAR MEASURE. NONTRADING PRINCIPAL INVESTING

ACTIVITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS ARE MANAGED

USING STRESS AND SCENARIO ANALYSES.

CHANGING TO THE 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CAUSED THE

AVERAGE VAR TO DROP BY $85 MILLION IN THE THIRD

QUARTER WHEN THE NEW MEASURE WAS IMPLEMENTED. UNDER

THE 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT

TO INCUR DAILY LOSSES GREATER THAN THOSE PREDICTED

BY VAR ESTIMATES ABOUT TWELVE TIMES A YEAR.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE

CHANGES IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING CAPTURES

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE

EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTS FOR BOTH ITS TRADING

AND NONTRADING ACTIVITIES AT LEAST EVERY TWO WEEKS

USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME CREDIT SPREADS

WIDEN SIGNIFICANTLY, EQUITY PRICES DECLINE AND

INTEREST RATES RISE IN THE MAJOR CURRENCIES.

ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS PREDOMINANT

IN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND INCLUDE

SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE

MOVES IN COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS. PERIODICALLY,

SCENARIOS ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND ECONOMIC

EVENTS. ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS

IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS

TESTING ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS

RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AND STRESS LOSSES

ARE MONITORED AGAINST LIMITS. STRESS TESTING IS

ALSO UTILIZED IN ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND

CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MEASUREMENT, AS WELL AS AN

INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION. STRESS-TEST

RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED AT

LEAST EVERY TWO WEEKS TO THE FIRMS SENIOR

MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO HELP

THEM BETTER MEASURE AND MANAGE RISKS AND

UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE

ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE

FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN MARKET

VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON

REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT. INTEREST

RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE NON-TRADING

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON- AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS AND CAN OCCUR DUE TO A

VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.



DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF LIABILITIES REPRICE QUICKER THAN ASSETS AND FUNDING INTEREST

RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS

THAT ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE DEPOSIT LIABILITIES ARE

REPRICING THAN ASSETS WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS WILL INCREASE

INITIALLY.



DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES

CHANGE (FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS THE

ABILITY TO LEND AT LONG-TERM FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES.

BASED UPON THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN

AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON ITS LIABILITIES (E.G., DEPOSITS)

WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ITS ASSETS (E.G., LOANS).

CONVERSELY, HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ASSETS GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO

EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES

PAID ON LIABILITIES.



THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFF-BALANCE

SHEET INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE BORROWERS THAN FORECASTED

PAY DOWN HIGHER RATE LOAN BALANCES WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, EARNINGS MAY

DECREASE INITIALLY.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO

ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED,

CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR

INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A

TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE

RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS

INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND

CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL

PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT

EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND

MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR RE-PRICING, AND

ANY INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE

RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE

DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NET

INTEREST INCOME FROM ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES

UNDER A

VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

SUCH A LOW PROBABILITY SCENARIO ARE NOT MEANINGFUL (NM).

THE CHANGE IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK FROM DECEMBER

31, 2007, RESULTS FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF AFS

SECURITIES AND LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE BENEFIT TO THE FIRM OF AN INCREASE IN RATES RESULTS FROM A WIDENING OF DEPOSIT MARGINS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY COMPRESSED DUE TO VERY LOW SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF REDUCED MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS. THE IMPACT TO THE

FIRMS PRETAX EARNINGS OF REDUCED MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS WOULD BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED UNDER A +200 BP PARALLEL SHOCK.

ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER SENSITIVITY INVOLVING A

STEEPER YIELD CURVE, WITH LONG-TERM RATES RISING

CURRENT LEVELS, RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH PRETAX

EARNINGS BENEFIT OF $740 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN

EARNINGS IS DUE TO REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSETS

AT THE HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES WITH FUNDING COSTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT

COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS

A POTENTIAL TAX CHANGE, AND ESTIMATING THE

PROBABILITIES OF LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH EVENTS.

THIS INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO THE FIRMS RIFLE

DATABASE. MANAGEMENT OF TRADING BUSINESSES CONTROL

RIFLE ENTRIES, THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO

MONITOR FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT

ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A

SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK

APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT

AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET

VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRENDS AND

MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND

UPDATES RISK LIMITS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING

THE FIRMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING

RISK LIMITS AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS.

CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS

LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE-OF-BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE

VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND

INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST WHICH

EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED. LIMIT

BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS SEGMENT IS

REQUIRED TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS OR CONSULT

WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATE ACTION.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ALSO PERFORMS

PERIODIC REVIEWS AS NECESSARY OF BOTH BUSINESSES

AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK TO ASSESS

THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL THEIR

MARKET RISK. STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT

DETAILS AND RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED, AND

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE

TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE

VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE

INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS

ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION.

THE MODEL RISK GROUP, INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES

AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE

FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND

CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF

FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION

AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT,

INCLUDING WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND ITS

SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SUITABILITY AND CONVERGENCE

PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF

DATA SOURCES, CONSISTENCY OF THE TREATMENT WITH

MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO

INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE

PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED OF NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS

WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS

WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT

OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY AND

WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE

DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED

UPON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED

BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 107111 OF THIS ANNUAL

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAKES DIRECT PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM

HOLDING PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS

DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK OF

POSITIONS HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE

FIRMS APPROACH TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE

STRUCTURE. CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING

EXPECTED LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN

ORDER TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN

PLACE AND INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE

PORTFOLIO. ALL INVEST-

MENTS ARE APPROVED BY AN

INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES EXECUTIVES WHO

ARE NOT PART OF THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. AN

INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING

VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESSES WAS $6.9 BILLION AND

$7.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $483 MILLION

AND $390 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTED

PUBLICLY TRADED POSITIONS. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, SEE

PAGE 63 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING

FROM INADEQUATE OR

FAILED PROCESSES

OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK

CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING

ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS,

INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS

THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN

FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM

MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND A

CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND

WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL

IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS,

IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN

WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES

TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS AND

DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY

APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY

ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED

BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK

SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL

COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX

ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF

OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK

IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING

AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER,

THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS

MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING,

REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

MAY GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES. ALL BUSINESSES

UTILIZE THE FIRMS STANDARD SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS

AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE AS A DYNAMIC RISK

MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY

OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND

ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE

CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL

ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD

ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES

ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL

RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS AND

LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED

BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK-EVENT

TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN

BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE

ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED

ENABLES THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST AGAINST

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE FIRM IS A FOUNDING

MEMBER OF

THE OPERATIONAL RISKDATA EXCHANGE ASSOCIATION, A

NOT-FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FORMED FOR THE

PURPOSE OF COLLECTING OPERATIONAL LOSS DATA,

SHARING DATA IN AN ANONYMOUS FORM AND BENCHMARKING

RESULTS BACK TO MEMBERS. SUCH INFORMATION

SUPPLEMENTS THE FIRMS ONGOING OPERATIONAL RISK

MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY

AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION

ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS

AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS

IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL

RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE

CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF

AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS

OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

AND REPORTING. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING THE

OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS AND

ACCURACY OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS

AND THE LOSS DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING

ACTIVITIES.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS

PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET

AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS

RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE AMONG MANY

CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS

WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A REPUTATION FOR

BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

ATTENTION TO REPUTATION ALWAYS HAS BEEN A KEY

ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF

THE FIRMS REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

EVERYONE AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING

THROUGH THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING,

MAINTAINING ADHERENCE TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES,

AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS.

THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE A CONFLICTS

OFFICE, WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH

THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR

THE FIRM, AND REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK REVIEW

COMMITTEES, WHICH REVIEW CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH

CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND

STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS, THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO AFFECT ADVERSELY THE FIRMS

REPUTATION. THESE REGIONAL COMMITTEES, WHOSE

MEMBERS ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESSES

AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS IN THE REGION, FOCUS ON THE

PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS FROM THE

CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR

OTHERS.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS INCLUDE IN THEIR MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT OF

THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE,

FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES THAT MAY

PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS WITH

THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES WITH

THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING

INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS

PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO

THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF

PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES

THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A

CLIENT, INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION;

DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. IN

THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE

FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE

RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF THE

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO

SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING

FROM ANY OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES

TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FIRMS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF

ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS

REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT

TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED

POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE

THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS

MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED,

INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY

FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN

APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES

FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION

JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS

THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL

AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN

ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE

SHEET DATE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

166168 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE

EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE

DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN

ESTABLISHING THE INPUTS USED TO ESTIMATE THE

ALLOWANCES. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT

TO EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC FACTORS,

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND TO REFINE

LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK-RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS. WHOLESALE

LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE

OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN

ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN,

AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGORS DEBT

CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF

THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR

REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES,

MANAGEMENT STRENGTH AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY

IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE

BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT

INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND

INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER

OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD IMPACT THE

RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS

FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES.

WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT,

VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE

ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF

LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT,

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO WHETHER THE LOSS

ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER

THE ENTIRE CREDIT

CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE,

AS WELL AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA SHOULD BE USED

AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT

ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC LOAN

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS

ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS

WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE

LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC

EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED

IN THE LOSS FACTORS BY ESTABLISHING RANGES USING

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT

AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO

CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE

INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE

BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT

RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND

OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT

PORTFOLIO.

AS NOTED ON PAGE 84 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE

FIRMS WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK

RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN. ASSUMING A ONE-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS FOR

ITS ENTIRE WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR

ALL WHOLESALE LOANS WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME IS

REMOTE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO PROVIDE

AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT OF RISK RATINGS ON THE

ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR

WHOLESALE LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION IN

RISK RATINGS. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN

DETERMINING THE RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RISK RATINGS CURRENTLY

ASSIGNED TO WHOLESALE LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE.

CONSUMER LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT

BUREAU SCORES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL,

BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS, AND IS

INTENDED TO REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF

INCURRED LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO

ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONSUMER CREDIT PRODUCT SPECTRUM

CONTINUES TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, AS THE WEAK LABOR MARKET AND WEAK

OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN

INCREASED DELINQUENCIES, WHILE CONTINUED WEAK

HOUSING PRICES HAVE DRIVEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

IN LOSS SEVERITY. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE

DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN, AS WELL AS ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON

HOUSING PRICES AND THE LABOR MARKET. WHILE THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO

BOTH HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, IN THE

CURRENT MARKET IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ONE OR BOTH OF THESE

FACTORS MIGHT IMPACT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE BOTH FACTORS ARE

IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE LEVELS,

CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR OR THE OTHER MAY NOT OCCUR AT

THE SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY

INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE OTHER. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT

NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES OR

PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN BOTH OR EITHER OF

THESE FACTORS WILL ULTIMATELY IMPACT THE FREQUENCY

OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES, OR BOTH, AND

OVERALL LOSS RATES ARE A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE

FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL LOAN LOSSES.

THE ALLOWANCE IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL

LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF

LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ARRIVE

AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS

ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORY USING

DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS

TO ESTIMATE CHARGE-OFFS. MANAGEMENT UTILIZES

ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS

PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS TO REVIEW

THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS

ESTIMATE.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS ADJUSTED TO TAKE

INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL

FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE

OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS

USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND IS

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL

LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. IN

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT

TO PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT

APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN ESTIMATED RANGES IN

DETERMINING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

THE NUMEROUS UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE

RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT RELATED

TO UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT

MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

PORTFOLIO.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND

COMMODITIES INVENTORY

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF IT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ASSETS

ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING

BASIS, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER

OF COST OR FAIR VALUE THAT ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES.

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 157,

WHICH ESTABLISHED A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY

FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. AN

INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY IS

BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THEREFORE, FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1

AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY, WHERE INPUTS ARE

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THERE

IS LESS JUDGMENT APPLIED IN ARRIVING AT A FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS ARE MORE

SIGNIFICANT. THE FIRM REVIEWS AND UPDATES THE FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY CLASSIFICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

CHANGES FROM ONE QUARTER TO THE NEXT RELATED TO THE

OBSERVABILITY OF INPUTS TO A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

MAY RESULT IN A RECLASSIFICATION BETWEEN HIERARCHY

LEVELS.

VALUATION

FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. IN

ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN

INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST

DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE

TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL

RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION

INPUTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES,

INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT

PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES.

IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO

INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY.

FINALLY,

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO

REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRMS

CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, WHERE RELEVANT. THE

JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE

OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND

THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN

THE MARKET AS A WHOLE.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET

INPUTS CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS

RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE,

WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE

APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT

IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE

REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 129133

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IN ADDITION, FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, CERTAIN LOANS WITH

EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION OF CREDIT QUALITY SINCE

ORIGINATION AND FOR WHICH IT WAS PROBABLE, AT

ACQUISITION, THAT THE FIRM WOULD BE UNABLE TO

COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS

RECEIVABLE. THESE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP 03-3. MANY

OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE

APPLICATION OF SOP 03-3 ARE BOTH SIGNIFICANT AND

JUDGMENTAL, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME

PRICE DECLINES, THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE

CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE LACK OF MARKET

LIQUIDITY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE FACTORS THAT HAVE

IMPACTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT THESE

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES.

DETERMINING WHICH LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE

OF SOP 03-3 IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRES THE

APPLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, CONSUMER LOANS WITH

CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES (E.G., HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE

RATIOS, BORROWERS WITH LOWER FICO SCORES,

DELINQUENCIES) WERE DETERMINED TO BE

CREDIT-IMPAIRED, PROVIDED THAT THOSE ATTRIBUTES

AROSE SUBSEQUENT TO LOAN ORIGINATION.

WHOLESALE LOANS WERE DETERMINED TO BE

CREDIT-IMPAIRED IF THEY MET THE DEFINITION OF AN

IMPAIRED LOAN UNDER SFAS 114 AT THE ACQUISITION

DATE. APPLYING SOP 03-3 TO THE APPROPRIATE

POPULATION OF LOANS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LOANS

THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SOP 03-3 ARE

SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

CHOOSING DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES IN MAKING THE

MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF WHICH LOANS WERE

CREDIT-IMPAIRED AND WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SOP 03-3

COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DIFFERENT (I.E., LARGER

OR SMALLER) POPULATION OF LOANS DEEMED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE TRANSACTION DATE.

LOANS DETERMINED TO BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SOP

03-3 ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE

FIRM HAS ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE LOANS

BY DISCOUNTING THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED AT A MARKET OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE,

ADJUSTED FOR FACTORS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT

WOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. THE

INITIAL ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT,

AS SUCH CASH FLOWS WERE DERIVED FROM ASSUMPTIONS

SUCH AS DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES AND THE

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS. PARTICULARLY IN

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, ESTIMATING THE

INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF THESE LOANS WAS HIGHLY

SUBJECTIVE. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT

ASSUMPTIONS BY MANAGEMENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN

DIFFERENT INITIAL FAIR VALUES.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO AGGREGATE THE PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS INTO POOLS OF LOANS

WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING WHETHER

INDIVIDUAL LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS

FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING THESE POOLS. EACH

RESULTING POOL IS CONSIDERED ONE LOAN WITH A

COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND ESTIMATION OF CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED FOR PURPOSES OF

APPLYING SOP 03-3 SUBSEQUENT TO ACQUISITION. THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED SUBSEQUENT TO ACQUISITION IS BOTH

SUBJECTIVE AND JUDGMENTAL AND MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRMENT

LOSSES AND/OR INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE

DECISION TO POOL THESE LOANS AND THE MANNER IN

WHICH THEY WERE POOLED MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT AND/OR CLASSIFICATION OF

INTEREST INCOME AND/OR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO

REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT. SFAS 142

DEFINES REPORTING UNITS OF AN ENTITY AS EITHER SFAS

131 OPERATING SEGMENTS (I.E., ONE LEVEL BELOW THE

SFAS 131 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE

37 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT) OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE

SFAS 131 OPERATING SEGMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE

GENERALLY DETERMINED ITS REPORTING UNITS TO BE ONE

LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 37 ON PAGES 214215 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT, PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN CORPORATE. THIS DETERMINATION WAS BASED

ON HOW THE FIRMS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE MANAGED

AND HOW THEY ARE REVIEWED BY THE FIRMS OPERATING

COMMITTEE.

THE FIRM TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY

OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH

AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE,

INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR

CONDUCTING AN INTERIM TEST. THE FIRST PART OF THE

TEST IS A COMPARISON, AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL,

OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR

VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, THEN THE

SECOND PART OF THE TEST IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THE

AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE

IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL

IS CALCULATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF GOODWILL RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

RECORDS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING

UNIT GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF

THAT GOODWILL, THEN THE FIRM WOULD RECOGNIZE AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE,

WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE AGAINST NET

INCOME.

IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN THE

FIRST PART OF THE TEST IS DETERMINED TO BE GREATER

THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT

INCLUDING GOODWILL, THEN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS 142 GOODWILL IS DEEMED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM

PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING

AND CONCLUDED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF ITS

REPORTING UNITS WAS IN EXCESS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING VALUES INCLUDING GOODWILL. ACCORDINGLY,

THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT ITS GOODWILL WAS NOT

IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

110

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM CONSIDERS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS

TO BE ITS PRIMARY METHOD OF DETERMINING THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THE MODELS PROJECT

LEVERED CASH FLOWS FOR FIVE YEARS AND USE THE

PERPETUITY GROWTH METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL

VALUES. THE FIRST YEARS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS ARE

BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS INTERNAL BUDGET

FORECASTS FOR THE UPCOMING CALENDAR YEAR (WHICH ARE

REVIEWED WITH THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM).

TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS

DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, THE

FIRM ALSO ANALYZES MARKET-BASED TRADING AND

TRANSACTION MULTIPLES, WHERE AVAILABLE. THESE

TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED TO

ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES, AS OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION IS

GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE.

JPMORGAN CHASES STOCK PRICE, CONSISTENT WITH STOCK

PRICES IN THE BROADER FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR,

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE LAST HALF OF

2008. JPMORGAN CHASES MARKET CAPITALIZATION FELL

BELOW ITS RECORDED BOOK VALUE, PRINCIPALLY DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM

BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT MARKET

CAPITALIZATION COULD BE AN INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE

OVER TIME, THE FIRM IS OF THE VIEW THAT SHORT-TERM

FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION DO NOT

REFLECT THE LONG-TERM FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING

UNITS.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF

THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS AS WELL AS THE

APPROPRIATE COST OF EQUITY USED TO DISCOUNT THOSE

CASH FLOWS CAN IMPACT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.

IF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK WERE TO TRADE AT THE LEVEL IT

WAS AT THE END OF 2008 OVER A SUSTAINED PERIOD AND WEAK ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS

PERSIST, THESE FACTORS COULD INDICATE THAT THE

LONG-TERM EARNINGS

POTENTIAL OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED  WHICH COULD RESULT IN

SUPPLEMENTAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING DURING INTERIM

REPORTING PERIODS AND POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT OF

GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE.

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF

THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES,

INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY

BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO

DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF ITS

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND ITS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE

ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET

AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS

TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS. DISPUTES OVER

INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES

MAY BE SETTLED UPON AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE

APPEALS. IN SOME CASES, THE FIRMS INTERPRETATIONS

OF TAX LAWS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADJUDICATION BY THE

COURT SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS WHETHER

THE FIRM MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS

A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS, AND

THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS

APPROPRIATE.

THE FIRM DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT CURRENT MARKET

EVENTS WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT THE REALIZABILITY OF

ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASES

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD

IN WHICH IT OCCURS.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

DERIVATIVES NETTING  AMENDMENT OF FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 39

IN APRIL 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN 39-1, WHICH

PERMITS OFFSETTING OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES

OR PAYABLES WITH NET DERIVATIVE POSITIONS UNDER

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FIRM ADOPTED FSP FIN

39-1 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008. THE FSP DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF DIVIDENDS ON

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF 06-11, WHICH

MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY FOR DIVIDENDS

DECLARED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER

15, 2007. EITF 06-11 REQUIRES THAT REALIZED TAX

BENEFITS FROM DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

PAID ON EQUITY-CLASSIFIED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS THAT ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS BE

RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN

CAPITAL AND INCLUDED IN THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS

AVAILABLE TO ABSORB TAX DEFICIENCIES ON SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT AWARDS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF EITF

06-11, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE THESE TAX BENEFITS

AS PART OF THIS POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. THE

FIRM ADOPTED EITF 06-11 ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE

ADOPTION OF THIS CONSENSUS DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE SEC ISSUED SAB 109, WHICH

REVISES AND RESCINDS PORTIONS OF SAB 105.

SPECIFICALLY, SAB 109 STATES THAT THE EXPECTED NET

FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ASSOCIATED

SERVICING OF THE LOAN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF ALL WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS THAT

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS.

THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 109 ARE APPLICABLE TO

WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS ISSUED OR MODIFIED

BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE FIRM ADOPTED SAB

109 ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

PRONOUNCEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS/NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 141R AND

SFAS 160, WHICH AMEND THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AS WELL AS NONCONTROLLING

(I.E., MINORITY) INTERESTS. FOR JPMORGAN CHASE,

SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

THAT CLOSE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. SFAS 160 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SFAS 141R WILL GENERALLY ONLY IMPACT THE

ACCOUNTING FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND

WILL IMPACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF BUSINESS COMBINATION

ACCOUNTING, SUCH AS TRANSACTION COSTS AND CERTAIN

MERGER-RELATED RESTRUCTURING RESERVES, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR PARTIAL ACQUISITIONS WHERE

CONTROL IS OBTAINED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. ONE

EXCEPTION TO THE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF SFAS

141R RELATES TO ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT CLOSED

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009. ONCE THE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENT PERIOD CLOSES FOR THESE

ACQUISITIONS, ANY FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME

TAXES RECORDED AS PART OF THESE BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS WILL IMPACT INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

PREVIOUSLY, FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS WERE PREDOMINATELY

RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS TO GOODWILL. JPMORGAN CHASE

WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT THAT SFAS 141R

WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 160 REQUIRES THAT NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AND PRESENTED AS EQUITY, RATHER THAN

AS A LIABILITY OR MEZZANINE EQUITY. CHANGES TO HOW

THE INCOME STATEMENT IS PRESENTED WILL ALSO RESULT.

SFAS 160 PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

ARE TO BE

APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

PRONOUNCEMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR RATIOS.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

REPURCHASE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS

IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 140-3,

WHICH REQUIRES AN INITIAL TRANSFER OF A FINANCIAL

ASSET AND A REPURCHASE FINANCING THAT WAS ENTERED

INTO CONTEMPORA-NEOUSLY WITH, OR IN CONTEMPLATION

OF, THE INITIAL TRANSFER TO BE EVALUATED TOGETHER

AS A LINKED TRANSACTION UNDER SFAS 140, UNLESS

CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. THE FIRM ADOPTED FSP FAS

140-3 ON JANUARY 1, 2009, FOR NEW TRANSACTIONS

ENTERED INTO AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE

ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 140-3 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES  FASB STATEMENT NO. 161

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 161, WHICH

AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 133.

SFAS 161 REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES ABOUT

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND

THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS. SFAS 161 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER

15, 2008, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. SFAS 161

WILL ONLY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURES OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AND NOT ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF 03-6-1,

WHICH ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING

SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND, THEREFORE, NEED TO

BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN COMPUTING

EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. FSP

EITF 03-6-1 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER

15, 2008, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS.

ADOPTION OF FSP EITF

03-6-1 DOES NOT AFFECT NET INCOME OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BUT MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF BASIC

AND/OR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN CERTAIN

PERIODS.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN GUARANTEES

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 133-1

AND FIN 45-4. THE FSP REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES

ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND GUARANTEES TO ADDRESS

THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CREDIT

RISK ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS OF THE SELLERS OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING

PERIODS ENDING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, WITH

EARLIER APPLICATION PERMITTED. THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS FSP ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FSP FAS 133-1 AND

FIN 45-4 ONLY AFFECTS JPMORGAN CHASES

DISCLOSURES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND GUARANTEES

AND NOT ITS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS, CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

OR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

DETERMINING WHETHER AN INSTRUMENT (OR EMBEDDED

FEATURE) IS INDEXED TO AN ENTITYS OWN STOCK

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE EITF ISSUED EITF 07-5, WHICH

ESTABLISHES A TWO-STEP PROCESS FOR EVALUATING

WHETHER EQUITY-LINKED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

EMBEDDED FEATURES ARE INDEXED TO A COMPANYS OWN

STOCK FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE

DERIVATIVE SCOPE EXCEPTION IN SFAS 133 SHOULD BE

APPLIED. EITF 07-5 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

EITF IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

THE FASB HAS BEEN DELIBERATING CERTAIN AMENDMENTS

TO BOTH SFAS 140 AND FIN 46R THAT MAY IMPACT THE

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE QSPES AND

VIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FASB IS PROPOSING TO

ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF QSPES FROM BOTH SFAS 140

AND FIN 46R AND MAKE KEY CHANGES TO THE

CONSOLIDATION MODEL OF FIN 46R THAT WILL CHANGE THE

METHOD OF DETERMINING WHICH PARTY TO A VIE SHOULD

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE. A FINAL STANDARD IS

EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2009, WITH AN

EXPECTED

EFFECTIVE DATE IN JANUARY 2010. ENTITIES EXPECTED TO BE IMPACTED

INCLUDE REVOLVING SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, BANK-ADMINISTERED

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS, AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. THE FIRM IS MONITORING THE FASBS

DELIBERATIONS ON THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND CONTINUES TO EVALUATE

THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. THE ULTIMATE IMPACT TO THE FIRM WILL DEPEND

UPON THE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB IN A FINAL STATEMENT AMENDING

SFAS 140 AND FIN 46R.

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET WHEN THE

MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE

IN OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 157-3,

WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF SFAS 157 IN A

MARKET THAT IS NOT ACTIVE AND PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE

TO ILLUSTRATE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING THE

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WHEN THE

MARKET FOR THAT FINANCIAL ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE. THE

FSP WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE, INCLUDING PRIOR

PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT

BEEN ISSUED. THE APPLICATION OF THIS FSP DID NOT

HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DISCLOSURE ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

INTERESTS IN VIES

ON DECEMBER 11, 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 140-4

AND FIN 46(R)-8, WHICH REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES RELATING TO TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES AND OTHER VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FSP IS TO REQUIRE

IMPROVED DISCLOSURE BY PUBLIC ENTERPRISES PRIOR TO

THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO

SFAS 140 AND FIN 46(R). THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE

FSP IS FOR REPORTING PERIODS (INTERIM AND

ANNUAL) BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD

THAT ENDS AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. THE DISCLOSURES

REQUIRED BY THIS FSP ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. FSP SFAS 140-4 AND FIN 46(R)-8 ONLY AFFECTS JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURE OF

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATION ENTITIES AND OTHER VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES AND NOT ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS,

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 132(R)-1,

WHICH REQUIRES MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURES ABOUT

EMPLOYERS PLAN ASSETS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT

STRATEGIES, MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS,

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS, AND

VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE

OF PLAN ASSETS. THIS FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL

YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009. THE FIRM

INTENDS TO ADOPT THESE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

AMENDMENTS

TO THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE OF EITF ISSUE NO.

99-20

IN JANUARY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF 99-20-1,

WHICH AMENDS THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE IN EITF 99-20

TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT SECURITY IMPAIRMENT MODEL IN

EITF 99-20 MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE SECURITIES

IMPAIRMENT MODEL IN SFAS 115. FSP EITF 99-20-1

REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT A HOLDERS BEST

ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS BE BASED EXCLUSIVELY UPON

THOSE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD USE AND

ALLOWS FOR REASONABLE JUDGMENT TO BE APPLIED IN

CONSIDERING WHETHER AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS

HAS OCCURRED BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION

RELEVANT TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE SECURITY. FSP

EITF 99-20-1 IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2008, AND THEREFORE THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED FSP EITF 99-20-1

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

FSP DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR

PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED

BY JPMORGAN CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT

AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR

THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

121

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE

FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA (U.S.), WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE

FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL

SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL

TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 37 ON PAGES 214215 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES

CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES

PRESCRIBED BY BANK REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IS THE OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY OF THE

VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ENTITY. HOWEVER, A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ALSO MAY BE DEEMED

TO EXIST WITH RESPECT TO ENTITIES, SUCH AS

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), THROUGH

ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE CONTROLLING VOTING

INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS

AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY

BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR

CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A

SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY

OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE

AND NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES

A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS

THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES

TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE

ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS.

SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS

FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF

OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE

SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS

APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE)

FRAMEWORK UNDER SFAS 140 AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46R. THE

APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY. THE

QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY

TRANSFERS (SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE

MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA DEFINED IN SFAS 140. THESE

CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES

OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF

THE FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT EXERCISE CONTROL OVER

THE ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. ENTITIES

MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BY THE

TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AS LONG AS THEY

DO NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OR

TO CAUSE THE ENTITY TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE

CRITERIA. THE FIRM

PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE QSPE MODEL FOR

SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGES, AND CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT

LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

168176 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN AN SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA,

CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46R.

UNDER FIN 46R, A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT.

(1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO

PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM

OTHER PARTIES; (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE

RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE

ENTITYS OPERATIONS; AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS

THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE

ENTITYS LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE

ENTITYS RETURNS.

FIN 46R REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E.,

A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF

THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED

LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS

PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN

MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, THE FIRM THOROUGHLY

EVALUATES THE VIES DESIGN, CAPITAL STRUCTURE

AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIABLE INTEREST

HOLDERS. WHEN THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY CANNOT BE

IDENTIFIED THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM

PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPUTES

AND ALLOCATES EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS

TO VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE ALLOCATION OF

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED UPON

THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF EACH

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL

STRUCTURE. THE FIRM RECONSIDERS WHETHER IT IS THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS

OCCUR AS REQUIRED BY FIN 46R. FOR FURTHER DETAILS,

SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 177186 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

ALL RETAINED INTERESTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND NONCONSOLIDATED VIES

ARE REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES UNDER FIN 46R IN WHICH THE

FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND

FINANCING DECISIONS ARE EITHER ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR

AT FAIR VALUE IF ELECTED UNDER SFAS 159 (FAIR

VALUE OPTION). THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS

INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES 147148 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY

CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND

DISCLOSURES

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S.

CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE

EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S. REPORTING

ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH

LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES.

PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY (E.G.,

LAND, BUILDINGS, AND FIXTURES) AND PERSONAL

PROPERTY

(E.G., AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS). ACQUIRED

PROPERTY IS VALUED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO

SELL AT ACQUISITION. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED,

IF NECESSARY. ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO FAIR VALUE IN THE

FIRST 90 DAYS ARE CREDITED/CHARGED TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THEREAFTER TO OTHER

EXPENSE.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

CASH FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REDUCED THE

FIRMS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND FROM $0.38 TO $0.05 PER

SHARE, EFFECTIVE FOR THE DIVIDEND PAYABLE APRIL 30, 2009 TO

SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON APRIL 6, 2009.

ACQUISITION OF THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE

BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK

(WASHINGTON MUTUAL) FROM THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) FOR $1.9 BILLION.

THE ACQUISITION EXPANDS JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER

BRANCH NETWORK INTO SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING

CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA AND WASHINGTON, AMONG OTHERS.

THE ACQUISITION ALSO EXTENDS THE REACH OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS BANKING, COMMERCIAL BANKING, CREDIT

CARD, CONSUMER LENDING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT

BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 141.

THE $1.9 BILLION PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

LIABILITIES ASSUMED USING PRELIMINARY ALLOCATED

VALUES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE

GOODWILL. THE INITIAL ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE

PRICE WAS PRESENTED ON A PRELIMINARY BASIS AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, DUE TO THE SHORT TIME PERIOD

BETWEEN THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION (WHICH

OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ITS ANNOUNCEMENT ON

SEPTEMBER 25, 2008) AND THE END OF THE THIRD

QUARTER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141, NONCURRENT

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE,

SUCH AS THE PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER

INTANGIBLES, ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION WERE WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST THE NEGATIVE

GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER

WRITING DOWN THE NONFINANCIAL ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED

AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. AS A RESULT OF THE

REFINEMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE INITIAL

EXTRAORDINARY GAIN OF $581 MILLION WAS INCREASED

$1.3 BILLION TO $1.9 BILLION. THE COMPUTATION OF

THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE

PURCHASE PRICE TO THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION  BASED UPON THEIR

RESPECTIVE VALUES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, AND THE

RESULTING NEGATIVE GOODWILL  ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE MAY BE

MODIFIED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 25, 2009, AS MORE

INFORMATION IS OBTAINED ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED.

 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 157 (FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS), WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL

YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE FIRM CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION

FOR SFAS 157 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. SFAS 157.



DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO

TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE, AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE;



ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED UPON THE

TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT

DATE;



NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE IN EITF 02-3, WHICH REQUIRED THE DEFERRAL OF PROFIT AT

INCEPTION OF A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF

OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING THE VALUATION TECHNIQUE;



ELIMINATES LARGE POSITION DISCOUNTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS QUOTED IN ACTIVE

MARKETS AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS WHEN VALUING

LIABILITIES; AND



EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM ALSO CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION FOR SFAS 159

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. SFAS 159 PROVIDES AN

OPTION TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE

MEASUREMENT FOR SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS,

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS NOT

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ELECTED

FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES NOT PREVIOUSLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGES 144146

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS

THAT PRIMARILY USE, AS INPUTS, MARKET-BASED OR

INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING

BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES,

VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO

MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE

TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY OF THE

INSTRUMENT. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO

ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO

REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRMS

CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (CVA) ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR

PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE

VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS. MARKET PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO A AA CREDIT RATING

WHEREBY ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. THEREFORE, AN

ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO

ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE ADJUSTMENT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED

TO REDUCE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO EACH COUNTERPARTY, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL

RIGHTS OF OFFSET.



DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

THE FIRM IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS

INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRMS VALUATIONS COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2007, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS 157. THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE ADJUSTMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH CVA AND

INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP

MARKET.



LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS

ACTIVE) MARKETS OR TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK

POSITIONS (LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT TAKEN FOR POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY). THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE

INITIAL VALUATION BASED UPON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY OF THE MARKET IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT TRADES AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE

WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL

RISK COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. COSTS TO EXIT LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE

RISK POSITIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY

TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A POSITION DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL.



UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED

USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS  THAT

IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

THESE POSITIONS ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS WHERE PARAMETERS SUCH AS CORRELATION AND RECOVERY

RATES ARE UNOBSERVABLE. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO

MITIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR AND REVISION IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE MARKET PRICE PROVIDED

BY THE MODEL.

THE FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE INTENDED TO

ENSURE THAT ITS FAIR VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AN

INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS

VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR

SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS WITHIN THE

FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE

VERIFICATION GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE

RISK-TAKING FUNCTION, ENSURES OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED FOR

VALUATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS

WITH MATERIAL PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE

MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW

OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING IS PERFORMED.

ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE

MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS

INTO THEIR COMPONENTS, AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS,

WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; VALIDATING

VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT;

AND DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED

GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER

TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO

DETERMINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION

GROUP, ARE BASED UPON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE

APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO

CONFIRM THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND

PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE OR LESS TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. DURING 2008, NO MATERIAL CHANGES

WERE MADE TO THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE

MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT

BE INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE

OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM

BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND

CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE

OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

SFAS 157 ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION

HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED

UPON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS

OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.



LEVEL 2  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT.



LEVEL 3  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR A LEVEL 3 ANALYSIS, SEE PAGES 138139 OF THIS NOTE.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL

OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES USED FOR INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT

FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION

OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

ASSETS

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

(RESALE AGREEMENTS)

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESALE AGREEMENTS,

CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES OF THE RESALE AGREEMENT AND

ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET

RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. AS THE INPUTS

INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON READILY

OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, SUCH RESALE

AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS, NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. THE

FAIR VALUE OF SUCH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED

BY SFAS 107 ON PAGES 142143 OF THIS NOTE. LOANS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING AND

NONRECURRING BASIS ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPLICABLE

TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

WHOLESALE

THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS IS CALCULATED USING OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION, INCLUDING PRICING FROM ACTUAL MARKET

TRANSACTIONS OR BROKER QUOTATIONS WHERE AVAILABLE.

WHERE PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE

SPECIFIC LOAN, THE VALUATION IS GENERALLY BASED

UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS,

SUCH AS LOANS AND BONDS. THESE COMPARABLE

INSTRUMENTS SHARE CHARACTERISTICS THAT TYPICALLY

INCLUDE INDUSTRY, RATING, CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

SENIORITY, AND CONSIDERATION OF COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

RISK. IN ADDITION, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING PREVAILING MARKET SPREADS FOR CREDIT AND

LIQUIDITY RISK, ARE ALSO CONSIDERED IN THE

VALUATION PROCESS.

FOR CERTAIN LOANS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE

SECURITIZED, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON

OBSERVABLE PRICING OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

(ABS) WITH SIMILAR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COLLATERAL AND INCORPORATES ADJUSTMENTS (I.E.,

REDUCTIONS) TO THESE PRICES TO ACCOUNT FOR

SECURITIZATION UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING PORTFOLIO

COMPOSITION, MARKET CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY TO

ARRIVE AT THE WHOLE LOAN PRICE. WHEN DATA FROM

RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS IS AVAILABLE IT IS

INCORPORATED AS APPROPRIATE. IF PARTICULAR LOANS

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SECURITIZED THEY ARE MARKED

FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

POTENTIAL LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS AND PROPERTY

REPOSSESSION/LIQUIDATION INFORMATION, AS

APPROPRIATE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE,

SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE SECTION OF THIS NOTE ON PAGES 139141.

THE FIRMS LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED

IN TRADING ASSETS ARE LARGELY CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 3 DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE PRICING.

LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED IN LOANS

INCLUDING LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED LOANS,

HIGH-YIELD BRIDGE FINANCING AND PURCHASED

NON-PERFORMING LOANS HELD IN THE INVESTMENT BANK

(IB) ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF

LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

CONSUMER

FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS

(INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS AND CONSUMER REAL

ESTATE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SECURITIZED), FOR WHICH

MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE READILY

AVAILABLE, ARE BASED UPON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

ADJUSTED FOR PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS. THE DISCOUNT

RATES USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE BASED

ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR NEW ORIGINATIONS OF

COMPARABLE LOANS. FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES IS BASED UPON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF

INTEREST RATE CHANGES, SINCE THE EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS ALREADY REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CREDIT

RISK. CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS AND CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT

FAIR VALUE ARE NOT CLASSIFIED

WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, SEE THE

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION OF

THIS NOTE.

SECURITIES

WHERE QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE

AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LEVEL 1 SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHLY LIQUID GOVERNMENT

BONDS, MORTGAGE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE QUOTED

PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS (SUCH AS U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCY OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE

PASS-THROUGH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES) AND

EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITIES.

IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE

SPECIFIC SECURITY, THE FIRM MAY ESTIMATE THE VALUE

OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF OBSERVED

TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES

AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN

TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES (E.G., INDICATIVE OR

FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF RECENTLY EVIDENCED

MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES PROVIDED FROM

INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO USE

PRICING MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. IN CASES

WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACTIVITY OR LESS

TRANSPARENCY AROUND INPUTS TO THE VALUATION,

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT

OBLIGATIONS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND HIGH-YIELD

DEBT SECURITIES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE MAY

REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR

ANALYZING

DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES. FOR CASH

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS), EXTERNAL

PRICE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, CASH

CDOS ARE VALUED USING MARKET-STANDARD MODELS, SUCH

AS INTEX, TO MODEL THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL

COMPOSITION AND CASH FLOW STRUCTURE OF EACH DEAL;

KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE MARKET SPREAD DATA FOR

EACH CREDIT RATING, COLLATERAL TYPE AND OTHER

RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL FEATURES. ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON EXTERNAL PRICES OR

MARKET SPREAD DATA, USING CURRENT MARKET

ASSUMPTIONS ON PREPAYMENTS AND DEFAULTS. FOR THOSE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WHERE THE EXTERNAL PRICE

DATA IS NOT OBSERVABLE OR THE LIMITED AVAILABLE

DATA IS OPAQUE, THE COLLATERAL PERFORMANCE IS

MONITORED AND THE VALUE OF THE SECURITY IS

ASSESSED. TO BENCHMARK ITS VALUATIONS, THE FIRM

LOOKS TO TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS AND

UTILIZES INDEPENDENT PRICING PROVIDED BY

THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND RELEVANT

MARKET INDICES SUCH AS THE ABX INDEX, AS

APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY

INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS DIRECTIONAL

INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS

ESTIMATES. THE MAJORITY OF COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE

AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES

AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE CURRENTLY

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE

SECURITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SEE THE MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE SECTION OF

THIS NOTE ON PAGES 139141.

COMMODITIES

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE FOR COMMODITIES

INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICING AND

DATA DERIVED FROM THE MARKETS ON WHICH THE

UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. MARKET PRICES

MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR LIQUIDITY. THE FIRM ALSO HAS

POSITIONS IN COMMODITY-BASED DERIVATIVES THAT CAN BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE OR

OVER-THE-COUNTER. THE PRICING INPUTS TO THESE

DERIVATIVES INCLUDE FORWARD CURVES OF UNDERLYING

COMMODITIES, BASIS CURVES, VOLATILITIES,

CORRELATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY OTHER MODEL

PARAMETERS. THE VALUATION OF THESE DERIVATIVES IS

BASED UPON CALIBRATING TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS TO INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION FROM

SOURCES SUCH AS BROKERS AND DEALER CONSENSUS

PRICING SERVICES. WHERE INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE,

THEY ARE BENCHMARKED TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

BASED UPON HISTORIC AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS, THEN

ADJUSTED FOR UNCERTAINTY WHERE APPROPRIATE. THE

MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY AND

COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES VALUED USING QUOTED

PRICES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY. HOWEVER, FEW CLASSES OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE;

THUS, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE

ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL

SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES.

DEPENDING ON THE TYPES AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF

DERIVATIVES, FAIR VALUE CAN BE MODELED USING A

SERIES OF TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE BLACK-SCHOLES

OPTION PRICING MODEL, SIMULATION MODELS OR A

COMBINATION OF VARIOUS MODELS, WHICH ARE

CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. WHERE DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS

HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR SOME TIME, THE FIRM USES

MODELS THAT ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY. THESE MODELS REFLECT THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

131

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING

THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS

SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITY, AND THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. FURTHER, MANY OF THESE

MODELS DO NOT CONTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVITY,

AS THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN THE MODELS DO NOT

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, AND INPUTS TO THE

MODEL ARE READILY OBSERVABLE FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED

MARKETS, AS IS THE CASE FOR PLAIN VANILLA

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTION CONTRACTS AND CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS). SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE

GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE VALUED BASED UPON MODELS WITH

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND THAT

ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY, HAVE TRADE

ACTIVITY THAT IS ONE WAY, AND/OR ARE TRADED IN

LESS-DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL

3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES,

FOR EXAMPLE, INCLUDE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

REFERENCED TO MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, CERTAIN

TYPES OF CDO TRANSACTIONS, OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF

SINGLE-NAME STOCKS, AND CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST

RATE OPTIONS. SUCH DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS CREDIT

DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, THE VALUE IS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING

MORTGAGE RISK. AS THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT ACTIVELY QUOTED, THE ESTIMATE

OF FAIR VALUE CONSIDERS THE VALUATION OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (MORTGAGE LOANS). INPUTS TO

THE VALUATION WILL INCLUDE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON

SIMILAR UNDERLYING LOANS OR SECURITIES IN THE CASH

MARKET. THE PREPAYMENTS AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ON THE

UNDERLYING LOANS OR SECURITIES ARE ESTIMATED USING A

COMBINATION OF HISTORICAL DATA, PRICES ON MARKET

TRANSACTIONS, AND OTHER PREPAYMENT AND DEFAULT

SCENARIOS AND ANALYSIS. RELEVANT OBSERVABLE MARKET

INDICES SUCH AS THE ABX OR CMBX, ARE CONSIDERED,

AS WELL AS ANY RELEVANT TRANSACTION ACTIVITY.

OTHER COMPLEX PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO

CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE UNDERLYINGS, ALSO

FALL WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY. SUCH

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE COMPLEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ILLIQUID AND NON-STANDARD IN

NATURE, INCLUDING CDOS AND CDO-SQUARED. A CDO IS A

DEBT SECURITY COLLATERALIZED BY A VARIETY OF DEBT

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING BONDS AND LOANS OF DIFFERENT

MATURITIES AND CREDIT QUALITIES. THE REPACKAGING OF

SUCH SECURITIES AND LOANS WITHIN A CDO RESULTS IN THE CREATION OF

TRANCHES, WHICH ARE INSTRUMENTS WITH DIFFERING RISK PROFILES. IN A

CDO-SQUARED, THE INSTRUMENT IS A CDO WHERE THE

UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO CDOS. FOR

CDO-SQUARED TRANSACTIONS, WHILE INPUTS SUCH AS CDS

SPREADS AND RECOVERY RATES MAY BE OBSERVABLE, THE

CORRELATION BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENTS

IS UNOBSERVABLE. THE CORRELATION LEVELS ARE NOT

ONLY MODELED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS BUT ARE ALSO

CALIBRATED AT A TRANSACTION LEVEL TO LIQUID

BENCHMARK TRANCHES. FOR ALL COMPLEX CREDIT

DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS, ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WHERE

AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO REGULARLY RECALIBRATE ALL

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS.

CORRELATION SENSITIVITY IS ALSO MATERIAL TO THE

OVERALL VALUATION OF OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF

SINGLE-NAME STOCKS; THE VALUATION OF THESE BASKETS

IS TYPICALLY NOT OBSERVABLE DUE TO THEIR

NON-STANDARDIZED STRUCTURING. CORRELATION FOR

PRODUCTS SUCH AS THESE ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED

BASED ON AN OBSERVABLE BASKET OF STOCKS AND THEN

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

UNDERLYING EQUITIES.

FOR CALLABLE EXOTIC INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, WHILE

MOST OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE VALUATION CAN BE

OBSERVED IN ACTIVE MARKETS (E.G. INTEREST RATES AND

VOLATILITY), THE CALLABLE OPTION TRANSACTION FLOW

IS ESSENTIALLY ONE-WAY, AND AS SUCH, PRICE

OBSERVABILITY IS LIMITED. AS PRICING INFORMATION IS

LIMITED, ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON THE DYNAMICS OF

THE UNDERLYING MARKETS (E.G. THE INTEREST RATE

MARKETS) INCLUDING THE RANGE AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES

OF THE APPLICABLE INPUTS. IN ADDITION, THE MODELS

USED ARE CALIBRATED, AS RELEVANT, TO LIQUID

BENCHMARKS AND VALUATION IS TESTED AGAINST MONTHLY

INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND ACTUAL

TRANSACTIONS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AND CERTAIN RETAINED

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND CERTAIN

RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES

DO NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY

OBSERVABLE PRICES. WHILE SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR,

THE PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICALLY ARE NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF)

MODELS.



FOR MSRS, THE FIRM USES AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION MODEL IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO PROJECT MSR CASH FLOWS OVER

MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES TO

ESTIMATE AN EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE OAS MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO

CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS,

DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A

MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE

VALUATION INPUTS, MSRS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.



FOR CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS (SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS), A

SINGLE INTEREST RATE PATH DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS USED AND GENERALLY INCLUDES

ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON PROJECTED FINANCE CHARGES RELATED TO THE SECURITIZED ASSETS,

ESTIMATED NET CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAID TO

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS, AND SUCH INTERESTS ARE THEREFORE TYPICALLY

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATIONS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE

APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE

NOTE 16 AND NOTE 18 ON PAGES 168176 AND 186189,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE VALUATION OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, HELD PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, THE INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND

THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. AS SUCH,

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED INITIALLY

BASED UPON COST. EACH QUARTER, VALUATIONS ARE

REVIEWED UTILIZING AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT MARKET

DATA TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE

INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. SUCH MARKET DATA

PRIMARILY INCLUDES OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRADING

MULTIPLES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES CONSIDERED COMPARABLE

TO THE PRIVATE COMPANIES BEING VALUED AND THE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO

COMPANY, INCLUDING ITS HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES,

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA).

VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR

COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY

INHERENT IN A NONPUBLIC INVESTMENT AND THE FACT

THAT COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES ARE NOT IDENTICAL

TO THE COMPANIES BEING VALUED. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY

OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCING AND SALES TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES, FUTURE

EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR INVESTMENT, CHANGES

IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM APPLIES ITS VALUATION

METHODOLOGY CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND

BELIEVES THAT THE METHODOLOGY AND ASSOCIATED

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE. NONPUBLIC

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLICLY

HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED THROUGH

THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATELY HELD

EQUITY INVESTMENTS. PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS IN

LIQUID MARKETS ARE MARKED TO MARKET AT THE QUOTED

PUBLIC VALUE LESS ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGULATORY OR

CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS. DISCOUNTS FOR

RESTRICTIONS ARE QUANTIFIED BY ANALYZING THE LENGTH

OF THE RESTRICTION PERIOD AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE

EQUITY SECURITY. PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS ARE

LARGELY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

DETERMINED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AND IS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LIABILITIES

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

(REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS)

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES AND ARE THEN

DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR

THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS,

THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET

VALUE EQUAL TO, OR IN EXCESS OF, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A

RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT, OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT,

TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM (I.E., DVA) RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS. AS THE INPUTS INTO THE

VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON OBSERVABLE

PRICING INFORMATION, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FAIR VALUE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY

CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) IS

ESTIMATED BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS HELD BY THE VIES. THE VALUATION

OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DOES NOT INCLUDE AN

ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

FIRM, AS THE HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. AS THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION

ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICING INFORMATION, THE MAJORITY OF BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY.

DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

INCLUDED WITHIN DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND

LONG-TERM DEBT ARE STRUCTURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE

FIRM THAT ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

STRUCTURED NOTES, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES AND ARE

THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES

FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITIES. IN ADDITION, THE

VALUATION OF STRUCTURED NOTES INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE FIRM (I.E., THE DVA). WHERE THE

INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON

READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICING INFORMATION, THE

STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF

THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS

ARE UNOBSERVABLE, STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

VALUE), FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY THE

FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE

DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE

OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT

IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE

ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL

SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE

TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN

PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO, THE FIRM RISK MANAGES

THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL

LEVEL 3 ANALYSIS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS) WERE 6% OF TOTAL

FIRM ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FOLLOWING

DESCRIBES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO LEVEL 3 ASSETS

DURING THE YEAR.

LEVEL 3 ASSETS INCREASED $46.9 BILLION IN 2008,

LARGELY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.



ACQUISITION OF $41.5 BILLION OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WITH BEAR

STEARNS.



ACQUISITION OF $5.9 BILLION OF MSRS RELATED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.



PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION OF REVERSE MORTGAGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2008, FOR WHICH THERE IS LIMITED PRICING INFORMATION AND A LACK OF MARKET LIQUIDITY.



TRANSFERS OF $14.0 BILLION OF AAA-RATED CLOS BACKED BY CORPORATE LOANS, BASED UPON A

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NEW DEAL ISSUANCE AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY; $10.5 BILLION OF MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES WITH A RATING BELOW AAA, OTHER NONINVESTMENT GRADE MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND

CERTAIN PRIME MORTGAGES; AND $2.8 BILLION OF AUCTION-RATE

SECURITIES, IN EACH CASE DUE TO A

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MARKET LIQUIDITY.

THE INCREASES IN LEVEL 3 ASSETS DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.



APPROXIMATELY $20.0 BILLION OF SALES AND MARKDOWNS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND ALT-A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.



$11.5 BILLION OF SALES AND MARKDOWNS OF LEVERAGED LOANS, AS WELL AS TRANSFERS OF

SIMILAR LOANS TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO THE INCREASED PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR SUCH ASSETS.

138

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS



$3.5 BILLION OF TRANSFERS OF BRIDGE LOANS TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO INCREASED PRICE

TRANSPARENCY FOR SUCH ASSETS.

GAINS AND LOSSES

GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE TABLES ABOVE FOR 2008 INCLUDE.



LOSSES ON TRADING DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.8 BILLION,

PRINCIPALLY FROM MORTGAGE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES.



A $6.9 BILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET.



LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION ON LEVERAGED LOANS.

LEVERAGED LOANS ARE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE INCLUDED IN THE NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE ASSETS.



GAINS OF $4.5 BILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED NOTES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

VOLATILITY IN THE EQUITY MARKETS.



NET GAINS OF $4.6 BILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CHANGES IN

CREDIT SPREADS AND RATE CURVES.

THE FIRM RISK MANAGES LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE VALUATION

HIERARCHY; THE EFFECT OF THESE RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE LEVEL 3 GAINS

AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN THE TABLES ABOVE.

CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INSTRUMENT,

IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RECORD A VALUATION

ADJUSTMENT TO ARRIVE AT AN EXIT PRICE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 157. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, AMOUNTS TO

REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRMS

OWN CREDITWORTHINESS. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

THE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THE FIRM CONSIDERS, SEE

THE VALUATION DISCUSSION AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

NOTE.

THE MARKETS VIEW OF THE FIRMS CREDIT QUALITY

IS REFLECTED IN CREDIT SPREADS OBSERVED IN THE

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP MARKET. THESE CREDIT SPREADS

ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSETS THE FIRM HOLDS.

CONSEQUENTLY, SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE

MORTGAGE-RELATED EXPOSURES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

AS NOTED ABOVE, CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

LOANS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDING MORTGAGE RELATED LOANS. SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2007,

LIQUIDITY IN CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE MORTGAGE

MARKETS HAS DECREASED, THEREBY LIMITING THE PRICE

$680 MILLION OF SECURITIES AND $261 MILLION OF

FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES.

CLASSIFICATION AND VALUATION

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL

OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN THE MARKETS FOR A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT. LEVEL 3 ASSETS INCLUDE

RESIDENTIAL WHOLE LOANS, PRIME AND ALT-A

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES RATED BELOW

AAA, SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES AND SINGLE-NAME CDS ON ABS. PRODUCTS

THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE RELIABLE PRICE TRANSPARENCY

AS EVIDENCED BY CONSISTENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

SUCH AS AAA-RATED PRIME AND ALT-A SECURITIES, AS

WELL AS AGENCY SECURITIES, CONTINUE TO BE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2.

FOR THOSE PRODUCTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF

THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS USING A COMBINATION OF

OBSERVED TRANSACTION PRICES, INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICES AND RELEVANT BROKER QUOTES. CONSIDERATION

IS GIVEN TO THE NATURE OF THE QUOTES

(E.G., INDICATIVE OR FIRM) AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF

RECENTLY EVIDENCED MARKET ACTIVITY TO THE PRICES

PROVIDED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES.

WHEN RELEVANT MARKET ACTIVITY IS NOT OCCURRING OR

IS LIMITED, THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED AS

FOLLOWS.

RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE LOAN

S  FAIR VALUE OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS ESTIMATED BY

PROJECTING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNTING

THOSE CASH FLOWS AT A RATE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT

MARKET LIQUIDITY. TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS (INCLUSIVE OF ASSUMPTIONS OF PREPAYMENT,

DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITY), SPECIFIC

CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC

AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO: THE BORROWERS FICO SCORE; THE TYPE OF

COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THE LOAN; AN ESTIMATE OF THE

CURRENT VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SUPPORTING THE

LOAN; THE LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE

LOAN; AND MARKET-DERIVED EXPECTATIONS FOR HOME

PRICE APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION IN THE

RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHY OF THE BORROWER.

RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

 FAIR

VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IS

ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL

AND THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF THE SECURITIES HELD

BY THE FIRM. THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL POOL

SUPPORTING THE SECURITIES IS

ANALYZED USING THE

SAME TECHNIQUES AND FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, ALBEIT IN A MORE

AGGREGATED MANNER ACROSS THE POOL. FOR EXAMPLE,

AVERAGE FICO SCORES, AVERAGE DELINQUENCY RATES,

AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITIES AND PREPAYMENT RATES, AMONG

OTHER METRICS, MAY BE EVALUATED. IN ADDITION, AS

EACH SECURITIZATION VEHICLE DISTRIBUTES CASH IN A

MANNER OR ORDER THAT IS PREDETERMINED AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE, THE PRIORITY IN WHICH

EACH PARTICULAR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY IS

ALLOCATED CASH FLOWS, AND THE LEVEL OF CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT THAT IS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THOSE CASH

FLOWS, ARE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DERIVING THE VALUE

OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. FINALLY,

THE RISK PREMIUM THAT INVESTORS DEMAND FOR

SECURITIZED PRODUCTS IN TODAYS MARKET IS FACTORED

INTO THE VALUATION. TO BENCHMARK ITS VALUATIONS,

THE FIRM LOOKS TO TRANSACTIONS FOR SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS AND UTILIZES INDEPENDENT PRICING

PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, BROKER QUOTES AND

RELEVANT MARKET INDICES SUCH AS THE ABX INDEX, AS

APPLICABLE. WHILE NONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARE SOLELY

INDICATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, THEY SERVE AS DIRECTIONAL

INDICATORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FIRMS

ESTIMATES.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES ARE LOANS TO COMPANIES BACKED

BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES

COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES.

TYPICALLY, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES HAVE LOCK-OUT

PERIODS, WHERE THE BORROWER IS RESTRICTED FROM

PREPAYING THE LOAN FOR A SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME, OR

PERIODS WHERE THERE ARE DISINCENTIVES FOR THE

BORROWER TO PREPAY THE LOAN DUE TO PREPAYMENT

PENALTIES. THESE FEATURES REDUCE PREPAYMENT RISK

FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES RELATIVE TO THAT OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES.

THE FIRM HAD EXPOSURE TO $7.2 BILLION OF

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS OR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH CONSISTED

OF $2.8 BILLION OF SECURITIES, LARGELY RATED

AAA, AND $4.4 BILLION OF FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES,

LARGELY IN THE U.S.

CLASSIFICATION AND VALUATION

WHILE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY,

DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY AND ACTIVITY IN

THE MARKETS, THE MAJORITY OF THESE MORTGAGES,

INCLUDING BOTH LOANS AND LOWER-RATED SECURITIES,

ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3. LEVEL 2 ASSETS

INCLUDE AAA-RATED FIXED-RATE COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS

 FAIR VALUE OF

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS ESTIMATED BY

PROJECTING THE EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNTING THOSE CASH FLOWS AT A

RATE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT MARKET LIQUIDITY. TO

ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, CONSIDERATION IS

GIVEN TO BOTH BORROWER-SPECIFIC AND OTHER MARKET

FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE

BORROWERS DEBT-TO-SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO; THE TYPE

OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (E.G., RETAIL, OFFICE,

LODGING, MULTI-FAMILY, ETC.); AN ESTIMATE OF THE

CURRENT LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO; AND MARKET-DERIVED

EXPECTATIONS FOR PROPERTY PRICE APPRECIATION OR

DEPRECIATION IN THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.

RATE RISK (THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRMS AGGREGATE

BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES).

CHANGES IN THE FIRMS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE

POSITION, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE OVERALL

PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE BACKED BY

EITHER U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, GOVERNMENT

SPONSORED ENTITIES, OR THEY ARE RATED AAA.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO INCLUDE.



$6.9 BILLION OF PRIME AND ALT-A SECURITIES, PRINCIPALLY RATED AAA. THE FAIR VALUE

SECURITIES IN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.



$3.9 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, PRINCIPALLY RATED AAA. THE



$127.0 BILLION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SFAS 157 TRANSITION

IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL ADOPTION OF

SFAS 157, THE FIRM RECORDED THE FOLLOWING ON

JANUARY 1, 2007.



A CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $287 MILLION, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE RELEASE OF PROFIT PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3;



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $166 MILLION ($103 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO THE

INCORPORATION OF THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE; AND



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $464 MILLION ($288 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO

VALUATIONS OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, THE FIRM APPLIED

THE PROVISIONS OF EITF 02-3 TO ITS DERIVATIVE

PORTFOLIO. EITF 02-3 PRECLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF

INITIAL TRADING PROFIT IN THE ABSENCE OF: (A)

QUOTED MARKET PRICES, (B) OBSERVABLE PRICES OF

OTHER CURRENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR (C) OTHER

OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING A VALUATION TECHNIQUE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED

THE DEFERRED PROFIT IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS (TYPICALLY

STRAIGHT-LINE AMORTIZATION OVER THE LIFE OF THE

INSTRUMENTS) AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECAME

AVAILABLE.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 THE FIRM DID NOT

INCORPORATE AN ADJUSTMENT INTO THE VALUATION OF

LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. COMMENCING JANUARY 1,

2007, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS

157, AN ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO THE VALUATION OF

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE TO REFLECT THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, PRIVATELY HELD

INVESTMENTS WERE INITIALLY VALUED BASED UPON COST.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATELY HELD INVESTMENTS

WERE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE

AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS

WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. THE INVESTMENTS

WERE ALSO SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY

PRIVATE EQUITY SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. THE

INCREASE IN PRETAX INCOME RELATED TO NONPUBLIC

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 WAS DUE TO THERE BEING

SUFFICIENT MARKET EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN

INCREASE IN FAIR VALUES USING THE SFAS 157

METHODOLOGY, ALTHOUGH THERE HAD NOT BEEN AN ACTUAL

THIRD-PARTY MARKET TRANSACTION RELATED TO SUCH

INVESTMENTS.

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107

MANY BUT NOT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD

BY THE FIRM ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. SFAS 107 REQUIRES

DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE METHODS AND

SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR

VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

SFAS 107 ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL

NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

SCOPE OF SFAS 107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A

PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED

LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH

ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT

CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT

VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS

NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED

AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE

DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY

NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS,

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES,

SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND

ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE, COMMERCIAL PAPER,

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES,

OTHER BORROWED FUNDS (EXCLUDING ADVANCES FROM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS), ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED

LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT

THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO

STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN

MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING

VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION

OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR

WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

(WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN

RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, UPON WHICH THE COST

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS) AND LOAN

EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED

UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN

OBLIGOR DEFAULTS). ON THIS BASIS, THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS A

LIABILITY OF $7.5 BILLION AND

$1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM DOES NOT

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR

CANCEL THESE COMMITMENTS BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER

PRIOR NOTICE, OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS

PERMITTED BY LAW.

SERVICES (RFS).

THE ELECTION TO FAIR VALUE THE ABOVE LOANS DID

NOT INCLUDE LOANS WITHIN THESE PORTFOLIOS THAT

EXISTED ON JANUARY 1, 2007, BASED UPON THE SHORT

HOLDING PERIOD OF THE LOANS AND/OR THE NEGLIGIBLE

IMPACT OF THE ELECTIONS.

WAREHOUSE LOANS ELECTED TO BE REPORTED AT FAIR

VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING WAREHOUSE LOANS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

168176 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, THE FIRM

ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR NEWLY ORIGINATED

BRIDGE FINANCING ACTIVITY IN IB. THESE ELECTIONS

WERE MADE TO ALIGN FURTHER THE ACCOUNTING BASIS OF

THE BRIDGE FINANCING ACTIVITIES WITH THEIR RELATED

RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOR THESE ACTIVITIES,

THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LOANS ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS; THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS IS RECORDED WITHIN

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

SECURITIES FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ELECTED TO RECORD AT

FAIR VALUE RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH

AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE OR A MATURITY OF GREATER

THAN ONE YEAR. THE INTENT OF THIS ELECTION WAS TO

MITIGATE VOLATILITY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

MEASUREMENT BASIS FOR THE AGREEMENTS (WHICH WERE

PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS) AND

THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS (WHICH

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS). AN

ELECTION WAS NOT MADE FOR SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS,

AS THE CARRYING VALUE FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS

GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE

13 ON PAGES 162163 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM BEGAN

ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR NEWLY TRANSACTED

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF GREATER THAN ONE

YEAR. AN ELECTION WAS NOT MADE FOR ANY SHORT-TERM

AGREEMENTS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE FOR SUCH

AGREEMENTS GENERALLY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.

STRUCTURED NOTES

IB ISSUES STRUCTURED NOTES AS PART OF ITS

CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES. STRUCTURED NOTES ARE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVES AND ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM DEBT. ON

JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ELECTED TO RECORD AT FAIR

VALUE ALL STRUCTURED NOTES NOT PREVIOUSLY ELECTED

OR ELIGIBLE FOR ELECTION UNDER SFAS 155. THE

ELECTION WAS MADE TO MITIGATE THE VOLATILITY DUE TO

THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT BASIS FOR

STRUCTURED NOTES AND THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT

ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL AS TO ELIMINATE THE

OPERATIONAL BURDENS OF HAVING DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING

MODELS FOR THE SAME TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

OTHER

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM ELECTED

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR THE ABCP INVESTMENTS

PURCHASED UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES AML

FACILITY FOR U.S. MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, AS

WELL AS THE RELATED NONRECOURSE ADVANCE FROM THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON (FRBB). AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, ABCP INVESTMENTS OF

$11.2 BILLION WERE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS; THE

CORRESPONDING NON-RECOURSE LIABILITY TO THE FRBB

IN THE SAME AMOUNT WAS RECORDED IN OTHER BORROWED

FUNDS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 21 ON PAGE

190 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN 2008, THE FIRM ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

CERTAIN LOANS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIO

AND FOR PRIME MORTGAGES PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED AS

(B)

STRUCTURED NOTES ARE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE TAILORED

TO MEET A CLIENTS NEED FOR DERIVATIVE RISK IN FUNDED FORM. THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE IS THE

PRIMARY DRIVER OF RISK. THE 2008 GAIN INCLUDED IN OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RESULTS

FROM A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES WHERE THE EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVE IS PRINCIPALLY LINKED TO EITHER EQUITY INDICES OR COMMODITY PRICES, BOTH OF

WHICH DECLINED SHARPLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008. ALTHOUGH THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THE STRUCTURED NOTES IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, THE BALANCE REPORTED IN

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT

RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ELECTION

WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES

INCLUDED IN EARNINGS DURING 2008 AND 2007, WHICH

WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.



LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN

VALUE ARE

ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION OF

THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE

INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE

GENERALLY BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY

INFORMATION, WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.



LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK

WERE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD. THE GAIN FOR

2008 AND 2007 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WIDENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD.



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES

LENDING AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT

COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT

LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR

INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

NOTE 9  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 87 AND SFAS

88, AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

(OPEB) PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 106. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

SFAS 158, WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE ON

THEIR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS THE OVERFUNDED

OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THEIR DEFINED BENEFIT

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS 158 REQUIRES UNRECOGNIZED

AMOUNTS (E.G., NET LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS)

TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) (AOCI) AND THAT

THESE AMOUNTS BE ADJUSTED AS THEY ARE SUBSEQUENTLY

RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT

COST BASED UPON THE CURRENT AMORTIZATION AND

RECOGNITION

REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 87 AND SFAS 106. THE FIRM

PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED SFAS 158 ON DECEMBER 31,

2006, AND RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO AOCI OF

$1.1 BILLION AT THAT DATE.

SFAS 158 ALSO ELIMINATES THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 87

AND SFAS 106 THAT ALLOW PLAN ASSETS AND

OBLIGATIONS TO BE MEASURED AS OF A DATE NOT MORE

THAN THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE REPORTING ENTITYS

BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE FIRM USES A MEASUREMENT

DATE OF DECEMBER 31 FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS; THEREFORE, THIS PROVISION

OF SFAS 158 HAD NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR

VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS OPEB PLANS, A

CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF

NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF

THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS 10 PERCENT

OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS,

AS WELL AS PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER

THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY NINE

YEARS (THE DECREASE OF ONE YEAR FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

IN THE ASSUMPTIONS IS RELATED TO PENSION PLAN

DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTION REVISIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, TO REFLECT RECENT EXPERIENCE RELATING TO THE

FORM AND TIMING OF BENEFIT DISTRIBUTIONS AND RATES

OF TURNOVER). FOR OPEB PLANS, ANY EXCESS NET GAINS

AND LOSSES ALSO ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE

FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SIX

YEARS; HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL

ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FOUR YEARS. THE

AMORTIZATION PERIODS FOR NET GAINS AND LOSSES AND

PRIOR SERVICE COSTS FOR OPEB ARE UNCHANGED FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN

EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF PAY

AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO

BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED UPON ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN

TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR

OF SERVICE, AND BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008, BENEFITS

GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE

FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED UPON FACTORS SUCH AS

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS

IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER

APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS. ON

JANUARY 15, 2009, THE FIRM MADE A DISCRETIONARY

CASH CONTRIBUTION TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLAN OF $1.3 BILLION, FUNDING THE PLAN TO

THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNT UNDER APPLICABLE TAX

LAW. THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF 2009 CONTRIBUTIONS TO

ITS NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IS $44

MILLION, OF WHICH $20 MILLION IS CONTRACTUALLY

REQUIRED. THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2009

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.) DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS IS

NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT

PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN PAY

AND INTEREST CREDITS ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE

THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED

PLAN. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN THE AMOUNT OF $273

MILLION AND $262 MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

PLANS IN THE U.S. AND IN CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS

THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K)

SAVINGS PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES

TO MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO

TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN

CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT

OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A

NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. THE

FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO

A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND

LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A

ONE-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT AND ARE IMMEDIATELY

VESTED IN THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN MADE.

EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF

$250,000 OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS

DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY

PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES,

SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S.

EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF

SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON

THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE

MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE CONTRIBUTORY, WHILE THE LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO

QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED

WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI)

PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES,

COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND

OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE

USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE U.K. OPEB PLAN IS

UNFUNDED.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT

ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY

THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES ARE

DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK

APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED UPON HISTORICAL

RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC

ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE

OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET

CLASS. THE RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY

REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K.

GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE

THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE RETURN ON AA-RATED

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS HAS BEEN TAKEN AS THE

AVERAGE YIELD ON SUCH BONDS, ADJUSTED FOR THE

EXPECTED DOWNGRADES AND THE EXPECTED NARROWING OF

CREDIT SPREADS OVER THE LONG TERM.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE

YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS

WITH MATURITY DATES

AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS

PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED

FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY

CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN

YEARS IN WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS

GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE

REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS

OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE

U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS

REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF

THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FIRM INCREASED THE

DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET INTEREST

RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPENSE

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION FOR 2009. THE 2009

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT

7.5% AND 7.0%, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEALTH CARE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION DECLINED FROM

9.25% IN 2008 TO 8.5% IN 2009, DECLINING TO A RATE

OF 5% IN 2014. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

INTEREST CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION AND THE ASSUMED

RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT 5.25% AND

4.0%, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE

DISCOUNT RATE. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD

CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD

RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION

IN 2009 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSE. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE

IN 2009 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION AND AN INCREASE

IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF

APPROXIMATELY $159 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT

DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE NON-U.S.

PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE 2009

NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION. A 25-BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR

THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT

IN AN INCREASE IN 2009 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND AN

INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE

RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE

RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY

MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR AND ISSUER.

SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX

FOR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING

VARIOUS RISK FACTORS AND EACH PLANS INVESTMENT

RETURN OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S.

QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION, IN

RECOGNITION OF ITS LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ARE REBALANCED

WITHIN APPROVED RANGES ON A CONTINUED BASIS. THE

FIRM REVIEWS THE ALLOCATION DAILY AND ALL FACTORS

THAT IMPACT PORTFOLIO CHANGES TO ENSURE THE PLAN

STAYS WITHIN THESE RANGES, REBALANCING WHEN DEEMED

NECESSARY.

THE FIRMS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS

ARE HELD IN TRUST AND INVESTED IN A

WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITIES (INCLUDING

U.S. LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALIZATION

AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES), FIXED INCOME

(INCLUDING CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS, TREASURY

INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES), REAL

ESTATE, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENTS. NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND SIMILARLY

INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY,

FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE

FIRMS COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND

PARTIALLY THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE

ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED

IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRMS U.S.

AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS

DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT

IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY

STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE FAIR VALUES OF TOTAL PLAN

NOTE 10  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM ADOPTED

SFAS 123R AND ALL RELATED INTERPRETATIONS USING THE

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. SFAS 123R

REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES,

INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), TO BE MEASURED AT

THEIR GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES. THE FIRM ALSO ADOPTED

THE TRANSITION ELECTION PROVIDED BY FSP FAS

123(R)-3.

UPON ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRM BEGAN TO

RECOGNIZE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS

PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AN IMMATERIAL CUMULATIVE

EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RESULTING FROM THE SFAS 123R

REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE FORFEITURES AT THE GRANT

DATE INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING THEM AS INCURRED.

FINALLY, THE FIRM REVISED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES

ELIGIBLE FOR CONTINUED VESTING UNDER SPECIFIC AGE

AND SERVICE OR SERVICE-RELATED PROVISIONS

(FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES) UNDER SFAS 123R.

PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING

POLICY FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS GRANTED TO

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WAS TO RECOGNIZE

COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS STATED SERVICE

PERIOD. BEGINNING WITH AWARDS GRANTED TO

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN 2006, JPMORGAN

CHASE RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON THE GRANT

DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF

POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2006, THE FIRM ALSO BEGAN TO ACCRUE THE

ESTIMATED COST OF STOCK AWARDS GRANTED TO

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN THE FOLLOWING

YEAR.

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF 06-11, WHICH

REQUIRES THAT REALIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM DIVIDENDS

OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON EQUITY-CLASSIFIED

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ARE CHARGED TO

RETAINED EARNINGS BE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO

ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AND INCLUDED IN THE POOL

OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO

ABSORB TAX DEFICIENCIES ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF EITF 06-11, THE

FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE THESE TAX BENEFITS AS PART OF

THIS POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. THE FIRM ADOPTED

EITF

06-11 ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

CONSENSUS DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, 46

MILLION BEAR STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS,

PRINCIPALLY RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS),

CAPITAL APPRECIATION PLAN UNITS AND STOCK OPTIONS,

WERE EXCHANGED FOR EQUIVALENT

JPMORGAN CHASE AWARDS USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE

RATIO OF 0.21753. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE EMPLOYEE

STOCK AWARDS WAS INCLUDED IN THE PURCHASE PRICE

SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE AWARDS WERE FULLY

VESTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MERGER DATE UNDER

PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDED FOR ACCELERATED VESTING

UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF BEAR STEARNS. HOWEVER,

BEAR STEARNS VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS HAD NO

IMPACT ON THE PURCHASE PRICE; SINCE THE EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY OUT OF THE MONEY

AT THE MERGER DATE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS

WAS EQUAL TO ZERO UPON THEIR CONVERSION INTO

JPMORGAN CHASE OPTIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO EXCHANGED 6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS

COMMON STOCK FOR 27 MILLION SHARES OF BEAR STEARNS

COMMON STOCK HELD IN AN IRREVOCABLE GRANTOR TRUST

(THE RSU TRUST) USING THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO

OF 0.21753. THE RSU TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TO HOLD

COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING AWARDS GRANTED TO SELECTED

EMPLOYEES AND KEY EXECUTIVES UNDER CERTAIN BEAR

STEARNS EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. THE RSU TRUST WAS

CONSOLIDATED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, AND THE SHARES

HELD IN THE RSU TRUST WERE RECORDED IN SHARES HELD

IN RSU TRUST, WHICH REDUCED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY,

SIMILAR TO THE TREATMENT FOR TREASURY STOCK. A

RELATED OBLIGATION TO ISSUE STOCK UNDER THESE

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS IS REPORTED IN CAPITAL

SURPLUS. THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES HELD IN THE RSU

TRUST TO EMPLOYEES WILL NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE

FIRMS TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, NET

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE. SHARES IN THE RSU

TRUST WERE DISTRIBUTED IN 2008 WITH APPROXIMATELY

HALF OF THE SHARES IN THE RSU TRUST DISTRIBUTED IN

JANUARY 2009. THE REMAINING SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO

BE DISTRIBUTED OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED

LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

(THE 2005 PLAN). THE 2005 PLAN, PLUS PRIOR FIRM

PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF

ACQUISITIONS, CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS STOCK-BASED

INCENTIVE PLANS (LTI PLAN). THE 2005 PLAN BECAME

EFFECTIVE ON MAY 17, 2005, AFTER APPROVAL BY

SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 2005 ANNUAL MEETING. IN MAY

2008, THE 2005 PLAN WAS AMENDED AND UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE AMENDED PLAN AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, 348

MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE THROUGH MAY 2013. THE AMENDED 2005 PLAN IS

THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS

CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS.

RSUS ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT UPON

THEIR GRANT. RSUS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED ANNUALLY

AND GENERALLY VEST 50 PERCENT AFTER TWO YEARS AND

50 PERCENT AFTER THREE YEARS AND CONVERT TO SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK AT THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION,

RSUS TYPICALLY INCLUDE

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW

EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON VOLUNTARY

TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER

RESTRICTIONS. ALL OF THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO

FORFEITURE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE. AN RSU ENTITLES

THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT

TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON

STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING.

UNDER THE LTI PLAN, STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS HAVE

BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ON THE

GRANT DATE. THE FIRM TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO

CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR, AND IT ALSO

PERIODICALLY GRANTS DISCRETIONARY STOCK-BASED

INCENTIVE AWARDS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY

IN THE FORM OF BOTH EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

SARS. THE 2008 AND 2007 GRANTS OF SARS TO KEY

EMPLOYEES VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS (I.E., 20%

PER YEAR) AND THE 2006 AWARDS VEST ONE-THIRD AFTER

EACH OF YEARS THREE, FOUR, AND FIVE. THESE AWARDS

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY

PROVISIONS AND ALL AWARDS GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN

YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A

SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. FOR EACH

TRANCHE GRANTED (OTHER THAN GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES WHO

ARE FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE AT THE GRANT DATE),

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE

VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED

THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER

ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR EACH

TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME

FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD,

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE

EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEES FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY

DATE OR THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRMS POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON

SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS

IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR

TREASURY SHARES. DURING 2008 AND 2007, THE FIRM

SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY

ISSUING TREASURY SHARES. DURING 2006, THE FIRM

SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY

ISSUING NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM JANUARY 1

THROUGH MAY 31, 2006, AND BY ISSUING TREASURY

SHARES THEREAFTER.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN

AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO TWO MILLION SARS.

THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE

RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY

AWARDED BY THE FIRM. THE SARS, WHICH HAVE A

TEN-YEAR TERM, WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE NO EARLIER

THAN JANUARY 22, 2013, AND HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE

OF $39.83, THE PRICE OF JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK

ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD. THE NUMBER OF SARS THAT

WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE (RANGING FROM NONE TO THE

FULL TWO MILLION) AND THEIR EXERCISE DATE OR DATES

MAY BE DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED

ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE CEO

AND JPMORGAN CHASE. THAT ASSESSMENT WILL BE MADE BY

THE BOARD IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO THE FIFTH

ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF THE AWARD, RELYING ON

SUCH FACTORS THAT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THE BOARD

DEEMS

APPROPRIATE. DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY

SURROUNDING THE NUMBER OF SARS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

BE GRANTED AND THEIR EXERCISE DATES, A GRANT DATE

HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

HOWEVER, SINCE THE SERVICE INCEPTION DATE PRECEDES

THE GRANT DATE, THE FIRM WILL RECOGNIZE THIS AWARD

RATABLY OVER AN ASSUMED FIVE-YEAR SERVICE PERIOD,

SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD THROUGH THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM RECOGNIZED $1 MILLION IN COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IN 2008 FOR THIS AWARD.

RSU ACTIVITY

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS MEASURED BASED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE FIRM

USED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF ITS COMMON STOCK

PRICE AS THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IN

VALUING OPTIONS. THE FIRM COMPLETED A REVIEW OF ITS

EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IN 2006. EFFECTIVE

OCTOBER 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE BEGAN TO VALUE ITS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER

THAT DATE USING AN EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION

DERIVED FROM THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF ITS PUBLICLY

TRADED STOCK OPTIONS.

THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE

LENGTH OF TIME THAT AN EMPLOYEE MIGHT HOLD AN

OPTION OR SAR BEFORE IT IS EXERCISED OR CANCELED.

THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION WAS DEVELOPED USING

HISTORIC EXPERIENCE.

NOTE 12  SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS,

HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING

SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

146148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED PRIMARILY AS AFS WHEN USED TO MANAGE THE

FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, AS WELL

AS TO MAKE STRATEGIC LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS. AFS

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE SFAS 133 HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE REPORTED AS NET

INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE

INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT

THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO

HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE

CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. THE FIRM HAS NOT CLASSIFIED NEW

PURCHASES OF SECURITIES AS HTM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS.

AFS SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE

ANALYZED IN DEPTH AS PART OF THE FIRMS ONGOING

ASSESSMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.

POTENTIAL OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF AFS

SECURITIES IS CONSIDERED USING A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO

WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE

ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A SECURITY; AND

THE FIRMS INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE

SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN FAIR VALUE. WHERE APPLICABLE UNDER EITF

ISSUE 99-20, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE CASH FLOWS OVER

THE LIFE OF THE SECURITY TO DETERMINE IF ANY

ADVERSE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED THAT REQUIRE AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. THE FIRM

APPLIES EITF ISSUE 99-20 TO BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATIONS THAT ARE RATED BELOW AA AT

ACQUISITION OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR

OTHERWISE SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRM WOULD

NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED

INVESTMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR

VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT RECOVER ITS RECORDED

INVESTMENT, INCLUDING AS APPLICABLE UNDER EITF

ISSUE 99-20, WHEN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN CASH FLOWS

HAS OCCURRED.

THE FIRMS ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

NEAR TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL OF A SECURITY NOTED ABOVE INCLUDES

ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS RELEVANT TO THE

SPECIFIC INVESTMENT. FOR ASSET-BACKED INVESTMENTS,

SUCH RELEVANT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS MAY INCLUDE

RATINGS, VALUATION OF SUBORDINATED POSITIONS IN

CURRENT AND/OR STRESS SCENARIOS, EXCESS SPREAD OR

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION

LEVELS, AND WHETHER CERTAIN PROTECTIVE TRIGGERS

HAVE BEEN REACHED. FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED INVESTMENTS,

SUCH RELEVANT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS MAY INCLUDE

RATINGS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION,

AND FORECASTED PERFORMANCE UNDER VARIOUS HOME PRICE

DECLINE STRESS SCENARIOS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $438 MILLION

OF THE UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATE TO SECURITIES THAT

HAVE BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LONGER

THAN 12 MONTHS, AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO PRIME

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND CREDIT CARD-RELATED

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. THE PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY RATED AAA, WHILE THE

CREDIT CARD-RELATED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE RATED BBB. BASED UPON THE

ANALYSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED

TO THESE SECURITIES, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE

UNREALIZED LOSSES RESULT FROM LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS

IN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND NOT FROM

CONCERNS REGARDING THE CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS OR

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS PROBABLE THAT IT WILL NOT RECOVER ITS

INVESTMENTS, GIVEN THE CURRENT LEVELS OF COLLATERAL

AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS THAT EXIST TO PROTECT THE

INVESTMENTS. FOR SECURITIES ANALYZED FOR IMPAIRMENT

UNDER EITF 99-20, THE COLLATERAL AND CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT FEATURES ARE AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO

ENSURE THAT AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS HAS NOT OCCURRED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $6.2

BILLION OF THE UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATE TO

SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS

POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS; THESE LOSSES

LARGELY RELATE TO CREDIT

UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD-RELATED

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, $1.7 BILLION RELATES TO

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD-RELATED ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES, AND $304 MILLION RELATES TO RETAINED

INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS OWN CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLE

SECURITIZATIONS. THE CREDIT CARD-RELATED

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDE AAA, A AND

BBB RATINGS. BASED ON THE LEVELS OF EXCESS SPREAD

AVAILABLE TO ABSORB CREDIT LOSSES, AND

BASED ON THE VALUE OF INTERESTS SUBORDINATE TO THE

FIRMS INTERESTS WHERE APPLICABLE, THE FIRM DOES

NOT BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT IT WILL NOT RECOVER

ITS INVESTMENTS. WHERE APPLICABLE UNDER EITF 99-20,

THE COLLATERAL AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FEATURES ARE

AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT AN ADVERSE

CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS HAS NOT

OCCURRED. OF THE REMAINING UNREALIZED LOSSES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT HAVE

BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN

12 MONTHS, $2.7 BILLION RELATES TO

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY PRIVATE

ISSUERS AND $820 MILLION RELATES TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE

PREDOMINANTLY RATED AAA. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF

THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS NOTED ABOVE FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED

TO THE LOANS UNDERLYING THESE SECURITIES, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE

IT IS PROBABLE THAT IT WILL NOT RECOVER ITS

INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIES.

THE FIRM INTENDS TO HOLD THE SECURITIES IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO

ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN FAIR VALUE OR

MATURITY. THE FIRM HAS SUFFICIENT CAPITAL AND

LIQUIDITY TO HOLD THESE SECURITIES UNTIL RECOVERY

IN FAIR VALUE OR MATURITY. BASED ON THE FIRMS

EVALUATION OF THE FACTORS AND OTHER OBJECTIVE

EVIDENCE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT

THE SECURITIES ARE NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

MORE BASED UPON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED

FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED UPON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR

YEARS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS.

NOTE

14  LOANS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN MAY DIFFER BASED UPON

WHETHER IT IS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED AND AS TO

WHETHER THE LOAN IS USED IN AN INVESTING OR TRADING

STRATEGY. FOR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT,

THE ACCOUNTING ALSO DIFFERS DEPENDING ON WHETHER A

LOAN IS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

PURCHASED LOANS WITH EVIDENCE OF CREDIT

DETERIORATION SINCE THE ORIGINATION DATE AND FOR

WHICH IT IS PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT ALL

CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE WILL NOT

BE COLLECTED ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED.

THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK FOR LOANS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE

FOLLOWING.



AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED

INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, FOR LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS);



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE, FOR LOANS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE; OR



AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE, FOR LOANS

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS;



PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SOP

03-3 AND INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES ESTIMATED FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES.

ACCORDINGLY, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO THESE LOANS IS NOT RECORDED AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

SEE NOTE 5

ON PAGES 144146 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS ELECTIONS OF

FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 159. SEE NOTE 6

ON PAGES 146148 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

FOR LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, INTEREST INCOME IS

RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A BASIS

APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM

OF THE LOAN.

LOANS WITHIN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT

MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE

HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO. TRANSFERS TO HELD-FOR-SALE

ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON

THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ARE

CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND

LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, OR

EXCHANGE RATES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE.

LOANS WITHIN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO THAT

MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE

HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY

ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FIRMS

ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

166168 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF

INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN

CONSUMER AND PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS

IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL

PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR

WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST

DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO

COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF

TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY

CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED. INTEREST

ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS

PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS REVERSED AGAINST

INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF

NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST

INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO

THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE

THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE

COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL CASH

THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH LOANS (I.E., THE COST

RECOVERY METHOD). LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL

STATUS ONLY WHEN FUTURE

PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ARE REASONABLY

ASSURED.

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING

SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

EXAMINATION COUNCIL POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT

CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH

IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR

WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE

FILING OF BANKRUPTCY, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT NO LATER

THAN 180 DAYS

PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

163

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRODUCTS, IF COLLATERALIZED, ARE GENERALLY

CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 120 DAYS

PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS, AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS, STUDENT LOANS AND

CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY

DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. INTEREST AND

FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO

ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN

FULL. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER CONSUMER LOANS

IS GENERALLY REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME WHEN

THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF. A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS

RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN

SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER ASSETS, ONLY WHEN

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE

COLLATERAL, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

FOR PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, THE EXCESS OF

THE LOANS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER

THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE ACCRETABLE YIELD)

IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF

RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN, PROVIDED THAT THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. ON A PERIODIC BASIS, THE FIRM

UPDATES THE AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED FOR THESE LOANS, INCORPORATING

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS

SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS

AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES IN CASH FLOWS PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED TO BE

COLLECTED WOULD FIRST BE USED TO REVERSE ANY

RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE; ANY REMAINING

INCREASES ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS INTEREST

INCOME. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS

AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE, EXCLUDING DECREASES

RELATED TO REPRICINGS OF VARIABLE RATE LOANS, ARE

RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

DISPOSALS OF LOANS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF

LOANS, RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS IN FULL BY THE BORROWER,

OR FORECLOSURE, RESULT IN REMOVAL OF THE LOAN FROM

THE SOP

03-3 PORTFOLIO.

WITH RESPECT TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS,

WHEN

THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON

SUCH LOANS ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO

INTEREST IS ACCRETED AND THE LOAN IS REPORTED AS A

NONPERFORMING LOAN; OTHERWISE, IF THE TIMING AND

AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR PURCHASED

CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

THEN INTEREST IS ACCRETED AND THE LOANS ARE

REPORTED AS PERFORMING LOANS.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN LOANS

THAT IT DEEMED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED UNDER SOP

03-3. WHOLESALE LOANS WITH A CARRYING AMOUNT OF

$224 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WERE DETERMINED

TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 114. THESE WHOLESALE LOANS ARE

BEING ACCOUNTED FOR INDIVIDUALLY (NOT ON A POOLED

BASIS) AND ARE REPORTED AS NONPERFORMING LOANS

SINCE CASH FLOWS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL LOAN ARE NOT

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. SUCH LOANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM

THE REMAINDER OF THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, WHICH

RELATES SOLELY TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

CONSUMER LOANS.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS WERE

DETERMINED TO BE CREDIT-IMPAIRED BASED UPON

SPECIFIC RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOAN,

INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, FICO

SCORES, AND PAST DUE STATUS. SOP 03-3 ALLOWS

PURCHASERS TO AGGREGATE CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER INTO ONE OR

MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON

RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR

AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST

RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION,

ALL OF THE CONSUMER LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO

POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

THE FIRM DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED CONSUMER LOANS BY

DISCOUNTING THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED

AT A MARKET OBSERVABLE DISCOUNT RATE, WHEN AVAILABLE, ADJUSTED FOR

FACTORS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN

DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. IN DETERMINING THE CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, MANAGEMENT

INCORPORATED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES,

LOSS SEVERITIES AND THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

PREPAYMENTS. CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS WERE

DETERMINED FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCESS USED TO

ESTIMATE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, BUT

WITHOUT INCORPORATING ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO

DEFAULT RATES AND LOSS SEVERITIES.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ARE REPORTED IN LOANS

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

FOLLOWING THE INITIAL ACQUISITION DATE OF THESE

LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, IF ANY IS

REQUIRED, WOULD BE REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS. NO ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN

RECORDED FOR THESE LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

IMPAIRED LOANS

A LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED UPON

CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT

THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE

(INCLUDING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST) ACCORDING TO THE

CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT. IMPAIRED

LOANS INCLUDE CERTAIN NONACCRUAL WHOLESALE LOANS

AND LOANS FOR WHICH A CHARGE-OFF HAS BEEN RECORDED

BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL. IMPAIRED LOANS ALSO INCLUDE LOANS THAT

HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

AS A CONCESSION TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES. TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

TYPICALLY RESULT FROM THE FIRMS LOSS MITIGATION

ACTIVITIES AND COULD INCLUDE RATE REDUCTIONS,

PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, FORBEARANCE AND OTHER

ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND

TO AVOID FORECLOSURE OR REPOSSESSION OF COLLATERAL.

WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT

IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, FUTURE LENDING

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE

CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE FUTURE

COMMITMENTS TO LEND ADDITIONAL FUNDS RELATED TO

THESE MODIFIED LOANS. PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED

LOANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED AS IMPAIRED

LOANS AS LONG AS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO COLLECT ALL CASH FLOWS EXPECTED AT

ACQUISITION, PLUS ADDITIONAL CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO

BE COLLECTED ARISING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES

AFTER ACQUISITION.

ACCORDINGLY, NONE OF THE CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION ARE

REPORTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES.

INTEREST INCOME

ON IMPAIRED LOANS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE FIRMS

POLICY FOR RECOGNIZING INTEREST ON ACCRUAL AND

NONACCRUAL LOANS. CERTAIN LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

MODIFIED THROUGH TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

ACCRUE INTEREST UNDER THIS POLICY.

CATEGORIZED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AS FORMULA-BASED.

DURING 2008, LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS RELATED TO DELINQUENT MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS

INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CONSUMER TROUBLED DEBT

RESTRUCTURINGS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED PLANS TO FURTHER EXPAND LOSS

MITIGATION EFFORTS RELATED TO THESE PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING PLANS TO OPEN REGIONAL COUNSELING

CENTERS, HIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN COUNSELORS, INTRODUCE NEW FINANCING ALTERNATIVES, PROACTIVELY REACH

OUT TO BORROWERS TO OFFER PRE-QUALIFIED MODIFICATIONS, AND COMMENCE A NEW PROCESS TO INDEPENDENTLY

REVIEW EACH LOAN BEFORE MOVING IT INTO THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS. THESE LOSS MITIGATION EFFORTS,

WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENT VARIOUS FORMS OF TERM EXTENSIONS, RATE REDUCTIONS

AND FORBEARANCES, ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN THE BALANCE OF MODIFIED LOANS

CARRIED ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS,

WHILE MINIMIZING THE ECONOMIC LOSS TO THE FIRM AND PROVIDING ALTERNATIVES TO FORECLOSURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY MODIFY THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH BORROWERS WHO HAVE

EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. SUCH MODIFICATIONS MAY INCLUDE CANCELING THE CUSTOMERS AVAILABLE

LINE OF CREDIT ON THE CREDIT CARD, REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CARD, AND PLACING THE CUSTOMER

ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE

MODIFIED TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENT WILL REVERT BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS, WITH

THE AMOUNT OF ANY LOAN OUTSTANDING REFLECTED IN THE APPROPRIATE DELINQUENCY BUCKET AND THE LOAN

AMOUNTS THEN CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. UNDER THESE

PROCEDURES, $2.4 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION OF ON-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT CARD LOAN OUTSTANDINGS HAVE

BEEN MODIFIED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS

METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING ITS CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, THE FIRM HAD ALREADY

PROVISIONED FOR THESE CREDIT CARD LOANS; THE MODIFICATIONS TO THESE CREDIT CARD LOANS HAD NO

INCREMENTAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTE

15  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

DURING 2008, IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, THE FIRM RECORDED

ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.5 BILLION TO CONFORM

THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL LOAN LOSS RESERVE METHODOLOGIES TO THE APPROPRIATE JPMORGAN CHASE

METHODOLOGY, BASED UPON THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS. THIS AMOUNT

INCLUDED AN ADJUSTMENT OF $646 MILLION TO THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AN

ADJUSTMENT OF $888 MILLION TO THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE FIRMS METHODOLOGIES

FOR DETERMINING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

LOANS, ARE DESCRIBED MORE FULLY BELOW.

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) AND CONSUMER (SCORED)

LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE

FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOANS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND

MEASURED PURSUANT TO SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR

COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF THE LOAN IS LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT

LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED

INDIVIDUALLY, AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE

FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED FOR

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP 03-3 IF THERE ARE PROBABLE

DECREASES IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OTHER THAN DECREASES RELATED TO REPRICING OF VARIABLE RATE

LOANS. ANY REQUIRED ALLOWANCE WOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS

DISCOUNTED AT THE LOANS (OR POOLS) EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 165 - 166 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS. FOR RISK-RATED LOANS

(GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS), IT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL

CALCULATION, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND

CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION. THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT

(PD) AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (LGD). THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND EXPECTED

MATURITY. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL DATA, PRIMARILY CREDIT-RATING AGENCY

DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A STUDY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE

CREDIT CYCLE. FOR SCORED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS), LOSS

IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS, INCLUDING LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY

FACTORS, TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. IN DEVELOPING LOSS FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS,

KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HOUSING PRICES,

UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS, ARE CONSIDERED. MULTIPLE FORECASTING METHODS ARE USED

TO ESTIMATE STATISTICAL LOSSES, INCLUDING CREDIT LOSS FORECASTING MODELS AND VINTAGE-BASED LOSS

FORECASTING.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT WITHIN SPECIFIED RANGES TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

WHERE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, THE

DETERMINATION OF THE

APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS; RELEVANT INTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO; AND EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. FACTORS RELATED TO

CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION, WHERE

RELEVANT. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS ARE

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT.

THE SPECIFIC RANGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON

MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS,

THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT. MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED

ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A

METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES

AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT

ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

NOTE

16  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT

CARD, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT, AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE). JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES ARE

STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT REFLECTED

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW). THE

PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES IS TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS AND TO GENERATE

LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM THROUGH THE SALE OF LOANS TO THE QSPES. THESE QSPES ARE FINANCED THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF FIXED, OR FLOATING-RATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET.

THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS; (2)

THE ENTITY CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS, OR IF THE ENTITY IS A QSPE, ITS INVESTORS

CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THEIR

INTERESTS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL TO REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED

ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS THAT MEET THE ACCOUNTING SALES CRITERIA, THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED

DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD EXCEPT FOR SERVICING ASSETS WHICH ARE

INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. AT THE TIME OF SALE, ANY RETAINED SERVICING ASSET IS INITIALLY

RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. THE REMAINING CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE

LOANS SOLD AND THE OTHER INTERESTS RETAINED, BASED UPON THEIR

RELATIVE FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF

SALE. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE FOR THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY CALCULATING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS

USING MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES,

SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS

INVOLVED. SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGE 132 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE VALUATION OF

RETAINED INTERESTS.

THE FIRM MAY RETAIN INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS IN THE FORM OF UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST,

SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, DEBT AND EQUITY TRANCHES, ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND

SERVICING RIGHTS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE TYPE OF INTEREST, WHETHER OR NOT THE RETAINED INTEREST IS REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY

CERTIFICATE AND WHEN IT WAS RETAINED. INTERESTS RETAINED BY IB ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

SEE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS AND MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS SECTIONS

OF THE NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THEIR

RELATED RETAINED

INTERESTS. RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS AFS THAT ARE RATED BELOW AA BY AN EXTERNAL RATING AGENCY

ARE SUBJECT TO THE IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS OF EITF 99-20, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 12 ON PAGE 162 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE TOTAL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD IN JPMORGAN

CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, FOR WHICH SALE ACCOUNTING WAS ACHIEVED AND TO WHICH THE

FIRM HAS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES

SERVICING THE LOANS, HOLDING SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS, RECOURSE OR GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, THE FIRMS ONLY CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IS SERVICING

THE LOANS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS

(TRADING ASSETS, AFS SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS) ARE REFLECTED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE.

MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES.

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY BY MAJOR PRODUCT TYPE

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES BY MAJOR

PRODUCT TYPE.

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD SERVICES (CS) BUSINESS SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE FIRMS PRIMARY

CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLERS INTEREST

IN THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF

ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

CS MAINTAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS THAT IT SPONSORS. AS

SERVICER AND TRANSFEROR, THE FIRM RECEIVES CONTRACTUAL SERVICING FEES BASED UPON THE SECURITIZED

LOAN BALANCE PLUS EXCESS SERVICING FEES, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN CREDIT CARD INCOME AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 7 ON PAGES 148149 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS (WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM 4% TO

12%). AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE FIRM HAD $33.3 BILLION

AND $18.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ITS UNDIVIDED

INTERESTS IN THE TRUSTS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED

INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 22%

AND 19% FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE TRUSTS REPRESENT THE

FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE

TRUST THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SECURITIZED; THESE UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE

NOT REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES, ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL

COST, AND ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LOANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ADDITIONALLY,

THE FIRM RETAINED SUBORDINATED INTEREST IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES

ON THE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES TOTALING $3.0 BILLION AND

$2.7 BILLION (NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS) AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE

CLASSIFIED IN OTHER ASSETS.

THE FIRM RETAINED SUBORDINATED SECURITIES

IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS TOTALING $2.3

BILLION AND $284 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY, AND SENIOR SECURITIES TOTALING

$3.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. OF THE

SECURITIES RETAINED, $5.4 BILLION AND $284 MILLION

WERE CLASSIFIED AS AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. SECURITIES OF $389

MILLION THAT WERE ACQUIRED IN THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK TRANSACTION WERE CLASSIFIED

AS TRADING ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE SENIOR AFS SECURITIES WERE USED BY THE FIRM AS

COLLATERAL FOR A SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO

PREDETERMINED LIMITS FOR SOME CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS TO COVER DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS

OWED TO INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN SUCH

ESCROW ACCOUNTS RELATED TO CREDIT CARDS ARE

RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMOUNTED TO $74

MILLION AND $97 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND ORIGINATED COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGES.

RFS SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT IT

ORIGINATES AND PURCHASES AND IT TYPICALLY RETAINS

SERVICING FOR ALL OF ITS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. ADDITIONALLY, RFS MAY

RETAIN SERVICING FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS

PURCHASED BY IB. AS SERVICER, THE FIRM RECEIVES

SERVICING FEES BASED UPON THE SECURITIZED LOAN

BALANCE PLUS ANCILLARY FEES. THE FIRM ALSO RETAINS

THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

IT SELLS TO THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE

ASSOCIATION (GNMA), FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION

(FANNIE MAE) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION

(FREDDIE MAC) IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR SERVICING GUIDELINES AND

STANDARDS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MSRS, SEE NOTE 18 ON

PAGES 187188 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IN A LIMITED

NUMBER OF SECURITIZATIONS, RFS MAY RETAIN AN

INTEREST IN ADDITION TO SERVICING RIGHTS. THE

AMOUNT OF INTEREST RETAINED RELATED TO THESE

SECURITIZATIONS TOTALED $939 MILLION AND $221

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS TRADING OR AFS SECURITIES; THE CLASSIFICATION

DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE RETAINED INTEREST IS REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY

CERTIFICATE, HAS AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE, AND WHEN IT WAS RETAINED

(I.E., PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 155).

IB SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

(INCLUDING THOSE THAT IT PURCHASED AND CERTAIN

MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS) AND COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE LOANS THAT IT ORIGINATED. UPON

SECURITIZATION, IB MAY ENGAGE IN UNDERWRITING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE

SECURITIZATION TRUST. IB MAY RETAIN UNSOLD SENIOR

AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL

INTERESTS) IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF

SECURITIZATION. THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS

TRADING ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS

RETAINED WAS $155 MILLION AND $547 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

ADDITIONALLY, IB RETAINED $2.8 BILLION OF SENIOR

AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008; THESE

SECURITIES WERE RETAINED AT SECURITIZATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE

FIRMS UNDERWRITING ACTIVITY.

IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY TABLES BELOW, THE FIRM SOLD

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $122.0 BILLION,

$81.8 BILLION AND $53.7 BILLION DURING THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE LOAN SALES WERE

FOR SECURITIZATION BY THE GNMA, FANNIE MAE AND

FREDDIE MAC. THESE SALES RESULTED IN PRETAX GAINS

OF $32 MILLION, $47 MILLION AND $251 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE LOAN SALES ARE PRIMARILY

NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE

RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF

THE LOANS. HOWEVER, FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN

SALES, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO SHARE UP TO 100% OF

THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLD LOANS WITH

THE PURCHASER. SEE NOTE 33 ON PAGE 209 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LOANS

SOLD WITH RECOURSE.

3.3%-30.4% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATES.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED UPON A

10% OR 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY

CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED EASILY BECAUSE THE

RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO,

IN THE TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A

PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION.

IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT COUNTERACT OR

MAGNIFY THE SENSITIVITIES. THE ABOVE SENSITIVITIES

ALSO DO NOT REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES THAT MAY BE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE SUCH

RISKS.

THESE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING LOANS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE; THEY ACCRETE

INTEREST INCOME OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE LOAN WHEN CASH FLOWS ARE REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE, EVEN IF THE UNDERLYING LOANS ARE CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 163166 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(D)

TOTAL ASSETS HELD IN SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES WERE

$640.8 BILLION AND $307.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE $452.3 BILLION AND

$179.8 BILLION OF LOANS SECURITIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDES $152.4 BILLION AND

$107.8 BILLION OF SECURITIZED LOANS, RESPECTIVELY, IN WHICH THE

FIRM HAS NO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT; $33.3 BILLION AND

$18.6 BILLION OF SELLERS INTERESTS IN CREDIT CARD MASTER

TRUSTS, RESPECTIVELY; AND $2.8 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION OF

CASH AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT AND ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

(E)

REPRESENTS BOTH LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN

SECURITIZED.

(F)

INCLUDES SECURITIZED LOANS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

(G)

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, THE POLICY FOR CLASSIFYING SUBPRIME MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOANS AS

NONPERFORMING WAS CHANGED TO CONFORM TO ALL OTHER HOME LENDING

PRODUCTS. AMOUNTS FOR 2007 HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE.

(H)

EXCLUDES NONPERFORMING ASSETS RELATED TO (I) LOANS ELIGIBLE FOR REPURCHASE, AS

WELL AS LOANS REPURCHASED FROM GNMA POOLS THAT ARE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, OF

$3.3 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AND (II)

STUDENT LOANS THAT ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING, WHICH ARE INSURED BY U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER THE FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM, OF $437 MILLION AND

$417 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS FOR GNMA AND

STUDENT LOANS ARE EXCLUDED, AS REIMBURSEMENT IS PROCEEDING NORMALLY.

(I)

INCLUDES NONPERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE OF $32 MILLION

AND $50 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATIONS

SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON PAGE 220 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF SUBPRIME

LOANS. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LIMITED

DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES OF A QSPE UNDER SFAS 140,

THE OPERATING DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN EXISTING

SUBPRIME SECURITIZATIONS GENERALLY AUTHORIZE THE

SERVICER TO MODIFY LOANS FOR WHICH DEFAULT IS

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, PROVIDED THAT THE

MODIFICATION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE QSPES

BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND WOULD NOT RESULT IN

A REMIC VIOLATION.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM

(ASF) ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND

LOSS AVOIDANCE FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME

ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS (THE FRAMEWORK).

THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR SERVICERS TO

STREAMLINE EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR BORROWERS WITH

CERTAIN SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE (ARM)

LOANS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE MODIFICATIONS OF

SUCH LOANS WITH TERMS THAT ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR

THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SUCH BORROWERS. THE

FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL FIRST-LIEN SUBPRIME ARM

LOANS THAT HAVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST FOR AN

INITIAL PERIOD OF 36 MONTHS OR LESS, ARE INCLUDED

IN SECURITIZED POOLS, WERE ORIGINATED BETWEEN

JANUARY 1, 2005, AND JULY 31, 2007, AND HAVE AN

INITIAL INTEREST RATE RESET DATE BETWEEN JANUARY 1,

2008, AND JULY 31, 2010 (ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS).

THE FRAMEWORK CATEGORIZES THE POPULATION OF ASF

FRAMEWORK LOANS INTO THREE SEGMENTS: SEGMENT 1

INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS CURRENT AND IS

LIKELY

TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO ANY READILY AVAILABLE

MORTGAGE PRODUCT; SEGMENT 2 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE

THE BORROWER IS CURRENT, IS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

REFINANCE INTO ANY READILY AVAILABLE MORTGAGE

INDUSTRY PRODUCT AND MEETS CERTAIN DEFINED

CRITERIA; AND SEGMENT 3 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE

BORROWER IS NOT CURRENT, AS DEFINED, AND DOES NOT

MEET THE CRITERIA FOR SEGMENTS 1 OR 2.

ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS IN SEGMENT 2 OF THE FRAMEWORK

ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FAST-TRACK MODIFICATION UNDER

WHICH THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE KEPT AT THE

EXISTING INITIAL RATE, GENERALLY FOR FIVE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE INTEREST RATE RESET DATE. THE

FRAMEWORK INDICATES THAT FOR SEGMENT 2 LOANS,

JPMORGAN CHASE, AS SERVICER, MAY PRESUME THAT THE

BORROWER WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS PURSUANT

TO THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF THE BORROWERS LOAN AFTER

THE INITIAL INTEREST RATE RESET DATE. THUS, THE

FIRM MAY PRESUME THAT A DEFAULT ON THAT LOAN BY THE

BORROWER IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE UNLESS THE TERMS

OF THE LOAN ARE MODIFIED. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS

ADOPTED THE LOSS MITIGATION APPROACHES UNDER THE

FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME ARM LOANS THAT

MEET THE SPECIFIC SEGMENT 2 CRITERIA AND BEGAN

MODIFYING SEGMENT 2 LOANS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THE FRAMEWORK DID NOT

AFFECT THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

OF JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED QSPES THAT HOLD SEGMENT

2 SUBPRIME LOANS.

THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF ASSETS OWNED BY

FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES THAT HOLD SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE

RATE MORTGAGE LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, WAS $30.8 BILLION AND $20.0 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $12.7 BILLION AND

$9.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ARE RELATED TO ASF

FRAMEWORK LOANS SERVICED BY THE FIRM. INCLUDED

WITHIN THE ASSETS OWNED BY FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES WAS

FORECLOSURE-RELATED REAL ESTATE OWNED, FOR WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE IS THE SERVICER, IN

THE AMOUNT OF $3.5 BILLION AND $637 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE

GROWTH IN REAL ESTATE OWNED IN 2008 IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION

AND INCREASED FORECLOSURES RESULTING FROM CURRENT

HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF ASF FRAMEWORK

LOANS, SERVICED BY THE FIRM, THAT ARE OWNED BY

FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES THAT FELL WITHIN SEGMENTS 1,

2 AND 3 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

DECEMBER 31, 2008. THERE WERE NO SEGMENT 2 SUBPRIME

MORTGAGES MODIFIED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

A LOSS MITIGATION APPROACH, WITHOUT EMPLOYING THE

FAST-TRACK MODIFICATIONS PRESCRIBED FOR SEGMENT 2

SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, THAT IS INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE

THE RECOVERIES OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUST. THE

LOSS MITIGATION APPROACH CHOSEN BY JPMORGAN CHASE

IS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING

AGREEMENTS AND COULD INCLUDE RATE REDUCTIONS,

PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, FORBEARANCE AND OTHER

ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND

AVOID FORECLOSURE. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 17  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN

CHASES POLICIES REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES

OCCURS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANK: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS

IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. IB IS INVOLVED WITH VIES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND FOR

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION PURPOSES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. IB ALSO SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH

QSPES, TO CREATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES

168176 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM): PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER

OF THE FIRMS FUNDS DEEMED VIES. AM EARNS A FIXED FEE BASED UPON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS

VIES, AMS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH FUNDS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS

UNDER FIN 46(R).



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR THE SERVICES IT

PROVIDES. THE RELATIONSHIPS RESULTING FROM TSS SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46(R).



COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB): UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE

OF PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OFFERED IN IB. CB MAY ASSIST IN THE STRUCTURING AND/OR

ONGOING ADMINISTRATION OF THESE VIES AND MAY PROVIDE LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE VIE. THE RELATIONSHIPS RESULTING FROM CBS

SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46(R).



CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY: CORPORATE UTILIZES VIES TO ISSUE GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. SEE NOTE 23 ON PAGE 191 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS,

ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT COULD BE DEEMED VIES.

PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AICPA AUDIT AND

ACCOUNTING GUIDE

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

(THE GUIDE). IN JUNE 2007, THE AICPA ISSUED SOP

07-1, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ENTITY IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

THE GUIDE, AND THEREFORE QUALIFIES TO USE THE GUIDES SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(REFERRED TO AS INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING). IN MAY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN

46(R)-7, WHICH AMENDS FIN 46(R) TO PERMANENTLY EXEMPT ENTITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

GUIDE FROM APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) TO THEIR INVESTMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008,

THE FASB AGREED TO AN INDEFINITE DELAY OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SOP 07-1 IN ORDER TO

ADDRESS IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DELAYS FSP FIN 46(R)-7 AS WELL FOR THOSE

COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE FIRM, THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED SOP 07-1. HAD FIN 46(R) BEEN APPLIED TO

VIES SUBJECT TO THIS DEFERRAL, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL TO THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AS NOTED ABOVE, IB IS PREDOMINANTLY INVOLVED WITH

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND VIES ASSOCIATED WITH

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES. THESE

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES THAT ARE SPONSORED BY JPMORGAN

CHASE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE FIRM CONSIDERS A

SPONSORED VIE TO INCLUDE ANY ENTITY WHERE: (1)

JPMORGAN CHASE IS THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY OF THE

STRUCTURE; (2) THE VIE IS USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO

SECURITIZE FIRM ASSETS; (3) THE VIE ISSUES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JPMORGAN

CHASE BRAND NAME; OR (4) THE ENTITY IS A JPMORGAN

CHASE ADMINISTERED ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER

(ABCP) CONDUIT.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, AND IT HELPS

CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR

FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE ENTITIES

THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED

BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM.

THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO

THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF

REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW

FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE

ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMERS (I.E.,

SELLERS) TO THE CONDUITS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ARE GENERALLY

STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES

EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS, AND ARE TYPICALLY

IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY

THE SELLER, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF

THE FOLLOWING: RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR

ORIGINATOR, CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS, LETTERS OF

CREDIT, EXCESS SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED

INTERESTS OR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. THE

DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE

FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE

CONDUITS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES FEES RELATED TO THE

STRUCTURING OF MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS

AND COMPENSATION FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

FOR ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER, AND PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT.

AS A MEANS OF ENSURING TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE

CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DEAL-SPECIFIC

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS. THE

DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN

THE FORM OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND GENERALLY

STRUCTURED SO THE LIQUIDITY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED

BY THE FIRM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WILL BE EFFECTED

BY THE FIRM PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL

OF NONDEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS.

THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO PERFORM UNDER ITS ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CONDUIT AT ANY TIME.

THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER,

INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE

CONDUIT AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS THEN CURRENT

FAIR VALUE  IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF

THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE

DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

VEHICLES WITH PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IN

THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED SHORT-TERM REVOLVING

FACILITIES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS TO

HANDLE FUNDING INCREMENTS

TOO SMALL TO BE FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL PAPER AND IN

THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED LIQUIDITY FACILITIES THAT

CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS ONLY IN THE EVENT

OF SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET.

BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES WILL ONLY FUND NONDEFAULTED ASSETS,

PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS REQUIRED TO

ABSORB LOSSES ON DEFAULTED RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF

LOSSES ABSORBED BY ANY DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT. PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT MAY BE

PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE FORM OF STANDBY

LETTERS OF CREDIT OR BY THIRD-PARTY SURETY BOND

PROVIDERS. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED VARIES BY CONDUIT AND RANGES

BETWEEN 5% AND 10% OF APPLICABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER

OUTSTANDING.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE FIRMS

INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-CONSOLIDATED FIRM-ADMINISTERED

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THERE WERE NO CONSOLIDATED

THE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE AGREEMENTS IS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 33 ON PAGES

206210. THE CARRYING VALUE RELATED TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WAS $147 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, OF WHICH $138 MILLION REPRESENTED THE

REMAINING FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THE FIRM HAS

RECOGNIZED THIS GUARANTEE IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING

ENTRY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER ASSETS FOR THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE

FUTURE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACTS.

(B)

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF DRAWN COMMITMENTS

(I.E., SELLERS ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDES

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT) OF $42.9 BILLION AND $61.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, PLUS CONTRACTUAL BUT UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS OF $14.0 BILLION AND $27.7 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT ENHANCEMENT

AND LIQUIDITY TO FIRM-ADMINISTERED, MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, THE

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IS NOT

ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD BE ABSORBED BY THIRD- PARTY LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS.

ASSETS FUNDED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

JPMORGAN CHASES ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS FUND A VARIETY OF ASSET TYPES FOR THE

FIRMS CLIENTS. ASSET TYPES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, AUTO LOANS, TRADE

RECEIVABLES, STUDENT LOANS, COMMERCIAL LOANS,

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS (E.G.,

LOANS TO PRIVATE EQUITY, MEZZANINE AND REAL ESTATE

OPPORTUNITY FUNDS SECURED BY CAPITAL COMMITMENTS

OF HIGHLY RATED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS), AND

VARIOUS OTHER ASSET TYPES. IT IS THE FIRMS

INTENTION THAT THE ASSETS FUNDED BY ITS

ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS BE SOURCED ONLY

FROM THE FIRMS CLIENTS AND NOT ORIGINATED BY, OR

TRANSFERRED FROM, JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INFORMATION ON THE COMMITMENTS AND ASSETS HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASES

THE RATINGS SCALE IS PRESENTED ON AN S&P EQUIVALENT BASIS.

(B)

WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE FOR EACH ASSET TYPE IS BASED UPON THE REMAINING

TERM OF EACH CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS COMMITTED LIQUIDITY PLUS EITHER THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED

AVERAGE LIFE OF THE ASSETS SHOULD THE COMMITTED LIQUIDITY EXPIRE WITHOUT RENEWAL OR THE

EXPECTED TIME TO SELL THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN THE SECURITIZATION MARKET.

THE ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT IF THEY WERE RATED, THE FIRM

BELIEVES THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD RECEIVE AN A

RATING OR BETTER BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THE ASSETS HELD BY THE

CONDUITS TO BE EXPLICITLY RATED BY AN EXTERNAL

RATING AGENCY. INSTEAD, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK

GROUP ASSIGNS EACH ASSET PURCHASE LIQUIDITY

FACILITY AN INTERNAL RISK-RATING BASED UPON ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT FOR THE

TRANSACTION. THE RATINGS PROVIDED IN THE ABOVE

TABLE REFLECT THE S&P-EQUIVALENT RATINGS OF THE

INTERNAL RATING GRADES ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM.

THE RISK RATINGS ARE PERIODICALLY REASSESSED AS

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, 90% AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE

ASSETS IN THE CONDUITS WERE RISK-RATED A OR

BETTER.

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, WAS 27 DAYS AND 26 DAYS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS

0.6% AND 5.7%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE

TRADES AND INVESTS IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, INCLUDING

PAPER ISSUED BY THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS. THE

PERCENTAGE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PURCHASED BY THE

FIRM ACROSS ALL FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS DURING

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, RANGED FROM LESS

THAN 1% TO APPROXIMATELY 20% ON ANY GIVEN DAY. THE

LARGEST DAILY AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER

OUTSTANDING HELD BY THE FIRM IN ANY ONE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7

BILLION, OR 23%, FOR 2008, AND $2.7 BILLION, OR

16%, FOR 2007, OF THE CONDUITS COMMERCIAL

PAPER OUTSTANDING. ON AVERAGE, THE FIRM HELD

APPROXIMATELY 3% OF DAILY MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING DURING 2008.

TOTAL MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER

HELD BY THE FIRM AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS

$360 MILLION AND $131 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM IS NOT OBLIGATED UNDER ANY AGREEMENT

(CONTRACTUAL OR NON-CONTRACTUAL) TO PURCHASE THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY JPMORGAN

CHASE-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ADMINISTERED BY THE FIRM

WERE NOT CONSOLIDATED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, BECAUSE EACH CONDUIT HAD ISSUED EXPECTED LOSS

NOTES (ELNS), THE HOLDERS OF WHICH ARE COMMITTED

TO ABSORBING THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSS OF

EACH RESPECTIVE CONDUIT.

IMPLIED SUPPORT

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE

ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY ELN HOLDERS FROM

POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE CONDUITS HOLDINGS

AND HAS NO PLANS TO REMOVE ANY ASSETS FROM ANY

CONDUIT UNLESS REQUIRED TO DO SO IN ITS ROLE AS

ADMINISTRATOR. SHOULD SUCH A TRANSFER OCCUR, THE

FIRM WOULD ALLOCATE LOSSES ON SUCH ASSETS BETWEEN

ITSELF AND THE ELN HOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ELN.

EXPECTED LOSS MODELING

IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE

CONDUITS THE FIRM USES A MONTE CARLOBASED MODEL

TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF EACH OF THE

CONDUITS AND CONSIDERS THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND

OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST

HOLDERS. THE FIRMS EXPECTED LOSS MODELING TREATS

ALL VARIABLE INTERESTS, OTHER THAN THE ELNS, AS ITS

OWN TO DETERMINE CONSOLIDATION. THE VARIABILITY TO

BE CONSIDERED IN THE MODELING OF EXPECTED LOSSES IS

BASED ON THE DESIGN OF THE ENTITY. THE FIRMS

TRADITIONAL MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE DESIGNED TO

PASS CREDIT RISK, NOT LIQUIDITY RISK, TO ITS

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, AS THE ASSETS ARE

INTENDED TO BE HELD IN THE CONDUIT FOR THE LONGER

TERM.

UNDER FIN 46(R), THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO RUN THE

MONTE CARLO-BASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH TIME A

RECONSIDERATION EVENT OCCURS. IN APPLYING THIS

GUIDANCE TO THE CONDUITS, THE FOLLOWING EVENTS, ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE RECONSIDERATION EVENTS, AS THEY

COULD AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS.



NEW DEALS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL VARIABLE INTERESTS (CREDIT

SUPPORT, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC);



CHANGES IN USAGE, INCLUDING THE CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING VARIABLE

INTERESTS (CREDIT SUPPORT, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC);



MODIFICATIONS OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND



SALES OF INTERESTS HELD BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT

RUN ITS MONTE CARLO-BASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EVERY

TIME THERE IS A RECONSIDERATION EVENT DUE TO THE

FREQUENCY OF THEIR OCCURRENCE. INSTEAD, THE FIRM

RUNS ITS EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH QUARTER AND

INCLUDES A GROWTH ASSUMPTION FOR EACH CONDUIT TO

ENSURE THAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF ELNS EXISTS FOR

EACH CONDUIT AT ANY POINT DURING THE QUARTER.

AS PART OF ITS NORMAL QUARTERLY MODELING, THE FIRM

UPDATES, WHEN APPLICABLE, THE INPUTS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE EXPECTED LOSS MODEL.

SPECIFICALLY, RISK RATINGS AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT

ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED. THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF EXPECTED LOSS NOTES OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WERE $136 MILLION AND

$130 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT THE MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USED WERE

REFLECTIVE OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS ASSUMPTIONS AND

APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED THE PROBABILITY OF CHANGES

TO RISK RATINGS AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULTS.

QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT MEANS FOR CLIENTS TO ACCESS

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE

CONDUITS EFFECTIVELY DISPERSE RISK AMONG ALL

PARTIES AND THAT THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE ECONOMIC

RISK IN THE FIRMS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IS NOT

HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

STATEMENT OR CAPITAL IMPACT AT THE DATE OF CONSOLIDATION. IF THE FIRM WERE REQUIRED TO

CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE CONDUITS AT FAIR VALUE, THE TIER 1 CAPITAL

RATIO WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 10.8%. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IS PRIMARILY BASED UPON PRICING FOR

COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE

THE PRICING OF CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS IS RENEGOTIATED WITH THE CLIENT, GENERALLY, ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS AND DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

(B)

CONSOLIDATION IS ASSUMED TO OCCUR ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE QUARTER, AT THE

QUARTER-END LEVELS, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ADJUSTMENT TO AVERAGE ASSETS IN THE

DENOMINATOR OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO.

THE FIRM COULD FUND PURCHASES OF ASSETS

FROM VIES SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY.

2007 ACTIVITY

IN JULY 2007, A REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT

COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES HELD

BY A FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT WAS PUT

TO JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER ITS DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITY. THE ASSET WAS TRANSFERRED TO AND RECORDED

BY JPMORGAN CHASE AT ITS PAR VALUE BASED ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THAT SUPPORTED THE

REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2007, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING

THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE

STATISTICS, RESULTED IN THE DETERMINATION BY THE

FIRM THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL WAS

IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WERE ALLOCATED TO THE

ELN HOLDER (THE PARTY THAT ABSORBS THE MAJORITY OF

THE EXPECTED LOSS FROM THE CONDUIT) IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS OF THE ELN NOTE.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2007, CERTAIN STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS

ORIGINATED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 AND BACKED

BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM

FROM TWO FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS.

IT BECAME CLEAR IN OCTOBER THAT COMMERCIAL PAPER

INVESTORS AND RATING AGENCIES WERE BECOMING

INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT CDO ASSETS BACKED BY

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURES. BECAUSE OF THESE

CONCERNS, AND TO ENSURE THE CONTINUING VIABILITY OF

THE TWO CONDUITS AS FINANCING VEHICLES FOR CLIENTS

AND AS INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER

INVESTORS, THE FIRM, IN ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATOR,

TRANSFERRED THE CDO ASSETS OUT OF THE MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS. THE STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS WERE

TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM AT

180

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THEIR PAR VALUE OF $1.4 BILLION. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE CDO ASSETS WERE

VALUED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT $5

MILLION AND $291 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THERE WERE NO OTHER STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS BACKED

BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGES REMAINING IN JPMORGAN

CHASE-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THE OCTOBER 2007

TRANSFER OF THE STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS FROM THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS TO JPMORGAN CHASE TO BE AN

INDICATOR OF JPMORGAN CHASES INTENT TO PROVIDE

IMPLICIT SUPPORT TO THE ELN HOLDERS. THIS TRANSFER

WAS A ONE-TIME, ISOLATED EVENT, LIMITED TO A

SPECIFIC TYPE OF ASSET THAT IS NOT TYPICALLY FUNDED

IN THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS NO PLANS TO PERMIT

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS TO PURCHASE SUCH ASSETS IN

THE FUTURE.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES

CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH

THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS

INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT,

MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE

FIRM IS ENGAGED IN THESE STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE

VEHICLES, ASSET SWAP

VEHICLES AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION

VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM HAS CREATED A SERIES OF SECONDARY MARKET

TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH

QUALIFYING TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW

INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE THEIR

INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A

TYPICAL TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES

FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS

AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF

SECURITIES: (1) PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES

AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

(RESIDUAL INTERESTS). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE

PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE,

WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL

BONDS IS LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY PUT, OR TENDER,

THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT

SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY

FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. UPON TERMINATION OF THE

VEHICLE, IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO

REPAY THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY, THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE EITHER TO EXCESS

COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST HOLDERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

THE THIRD-PARTY HOLDERS OF THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

IN THESE VEHICLES COULD EXPERIENCE LOSSES IF THE

FACE AMOUNT OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES EXCEEDS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

MUNICIPAL BONDS UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE.

CERTAIN VEHICLES REQUIRE A SMALLER INITIAL

INVESTMENT BY THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS AND

THUS DO NOT RESULT IN EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION. FOR

THESE VEHICLES THERE EXISTS A REIMBURSEMENT

OBLIGATION WHICH REQUIRES THE RESIDUAL INTEREST

HOLDERS TO POST, DURING THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE,

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO THE VEHICLE ON A DAILY

BASIS AS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS

DECLINES.

JPMORGAN CHASE OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER AND REMARKETING AGENT OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. AS THE LIQUIDITY

PROVIDER, THE FIRM HAS AN OBLIGATION TO FUND THE

PURCHASE OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES;

THIS OBLIGATION IS TRIGGERED BY THE FAILURE TO

REMARKET THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES.

THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS

CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION

EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY

BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT

PROVIDER, AND THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE

MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. A

DOWNGRADE OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.S

SHORT-TERM RATING DOES NOT AFFECT THE FIRMS

OBLIGATION UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY. HOWEVER,

IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS CREDIT

RATINGS, HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

INSTRUMENTS SUPPORTED BY THOSE LIQUIDITY FACILITY

COMMITMENTS MIGHT CHOOSE TO SELL THEIR INSTRUMENTS,

WHICH COULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS COULD BE DRAWN. IN VEHICLES

IN WHICH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN THE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS, IN ADDITION TO THE TERMINATION EVENTS,

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS

FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND THE

EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR THE

REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL INTEREST

HOLDERS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, A DRAWDOWN

OCCURRED ON ONE LIQUIDITY FACILITY AS A RESULT OF A

FAILURE TO REMARKET PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM WAS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE $19 MILLION OF PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLE WAS TERMINATED AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALES OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS, TOGETHER WITH THE

COLLATERAL POSTED BY THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER,

WERE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES. IN 2007, THE FIRM DID NOT EXPERIENCE

A DRAWDOWN ON THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, THE FIRM HELD $293 MILLION

AND $617 MILLION OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT

HELD BY THE FIRM AT ANY TIME DURING 2008 AND 2007

WAS $2.2 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OR

11% AND 5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES OUTSTANDING PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES

NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY RESIDUAL

INTEREST HOLDER FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE

MUNICIPAL BOND HOLDINGS.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL

BONDS, AND TO THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF

THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND. A DOWNGRADE OF A

BOND INSURER WOULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE OF THE

INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE

RATING OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES.

THIS COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY

INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR, AS PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS TYPICALLY REQUIRE

AN AA- BOND RATING. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, 97% AND 99%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE MUNICIPAL

BONDS HELD BY VEHICLES TO WHICH THE FIRM SERVED AS

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WERE RATED AA- OR BETTER,

BASED UPON EITHER THE RATING OF THE UNDERLYING

MUNICIPAL BOND ITSELF, OR THE RATING INCLUDING ANY

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH CREDIT-LINKED

NOTE (CLN) VEHICLES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES

HIGHLY RATED ASSETS, SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES, AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A

REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT

HOLD. THE VIE THEN ISSUES CLNS WITH MATURITIES

PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS IN

ORDER TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT

TO THE VIES INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN

PREFER USING A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY

THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN

SUCH NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE CLN VEHICLES IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE VIE,

AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL

CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS NOT HISTORICALLY PROVIDED

ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CLN VEHICLES OVER AND

ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FIRM TYPICALLY DOES

NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLN VEHICLES. AS A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE

FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE

VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY

SUCH VIES IS LARGELY INVESTMENT-GRADE, WITH A

MAJORITY BEING RATED AAA. THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURES BROADLY INTO TWO

TYPES: STATIC AND MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS

AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT EITHER

REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTINATIONAL

CORPORATION) OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED PORTFOLIO OF

CREDITS. THE FIRM GENERALLY BUYS PROTECTION FROM

THE VIE UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE. AS A NET BUYER

OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO

THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT (UP

TO THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR

MORE OF THE REFERENCE CREDITS DEFAULTS, OR IF THE

LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF THE REFERENCE

CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS.

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

THE FIRM ALSO STRUCTURES AND EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS

WITH ASSET SWAP VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. IN

SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THE VIE PURCHASES A SPECIFIC

ASSET OR ASSETS AND THEN ENTERS INTO A DERIVATIVE

WITH THE FIRM IN ORDER TO TAILOR THE INTEREST RATE

OR CURRENCY RISK, OR BOTH, OF THE ASSETS ACCORDING

TO INVESTORS REQUIREMENTS. GENERALLY, THE ASSETS

ARE HELD BY THE VIE TO MATURITY, AND THE TENOR OF

THE DERIVATIVES WOULD MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE

ASSETS. INVESTORS TYPICALLY INVEST IN THE NOTES

ISSUED BY SUCH VIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO

THE CREDIT RISK OF THE SPECIFIC ASSETS AS WELL AS

EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK

THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS; FOR EXAMPLE, AN INTEREST

RATE DERIVATIVE MAY ADD ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE

INTO THE VIE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RETURN ON THE

ISSUED NOTES; OR TO CONVERT AN INTEREST BEARING

ASSET INTO A ZERO-COUPON BOND.

THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE INTEREST RATE AND/OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE

ANY CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM HISTORICALLY HAS NOT PROVIDED

ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES. AS A

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR

CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH

DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

EXCLUDED FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL OF $1.0 BILLION AND $976 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

HELD A MAJORITY OF THE ISSUED NOTES OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS VEHICLES

A CDO TYPICALLY REFERS TO A SECURITY THAT IS

COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF BONDS, LOANS, EQUITY,

DERIVATIVES OR OTHER ASSETS. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT

WITH A PARTICULAR CDO VEHICLE MAY TAKE ONE OR MORE

OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS: ARRANGER, WAREHOUSE FUNDING

PROVIDER, PLACEMENT AGENT OR UNDERWRITER, SECONDARY

MARKET-MAKER FOR SECURITIES ISSUED, OR DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY.

PRIOR TO THE FORMAL ESTABLISHMENT OF A CDO VEHICLE,

THERE IS A WAREHOUSING PERIOD WHERE A VIE MAY BE

USED TO ACCUMULATE THE ASSETS WHICH WILL BE

SUBSEQUENTLY SECURITIZED AND SERVE AS THE

COLLATERAL FOR THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED TO

INVESTORS. DURING THIS WAREHOUSING PERIOD, THE FIRM

MAY PROVIDE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FINANCING TO

THE VIE, FOR WHICH THE FIRM EARNS INTEREST ON THE

AMOUNTS IT FINANCES. A THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGER

THAT WILL SERVE AS THE MANAGER FOR THE CDO VEHICLE

USES THE WAREHOUSE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FIRM TO

PURCHASE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE FUNDING

COMMITMENTS GENERALLY ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. IN

THE EVENT THAT THE SECURITIZATION OF ASSETS DOES

NOT OCCUR WITHIN THE COMMITTED FINANCING PERIOD,

THE WAREHOUSED ASSETS ARE GENERALLY LIQUIDATED.

BECAUSE OF THE VARIED LEVELS OF SUPPORT PROVIDED

BY THE FIRM DURING THE WAREHOUSING PERIOD, WHICH

TYPICALLY AVERAGES SIX TO NINE MONTHS, EACH CDO

WAREHOUSE VIE IS ASSESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN

46(R) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRM IS CONSIDERED

THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY THAT SHOULD CONSOLIDATE THE VIE. IN

GENERAL, THE FIRM WOULD CONSOLIDATE THE WAREHOUSE

VIE UNLESS ANOTHER THIRD PARTY, TYPICALLY THE ASSET

MANAGER, PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION FOR

POTENTIAL DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS HELD

BY THE VIE. IN THOSE CASES, THE THIRD PARTY THAT

PROVIDES THE PROTECTION TO THE WAREHOUSE VIE WOULD

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE.

ONCE THE PORTFOLIO OF WAREHOUSED ASSETS IS LARGE

ENOUGH, THE VIE WILL ISSUE SECURITIES WHERE MARKET

CONDITIONS PERMIT. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE

OF SECURITIES WILL BE USED TO REPAY THE WAREHOUSE

FINANCING OBTAINED FROM THE FIRM AND OTHER

COUNTERPARTIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CDO VEHICLE, THE FIRM

TYPICALLY

EARNS A FEE FOR ARRANGING THE CDO VEHICLE AND

DISTRIBUTING THE SECURITIES (AS PLACEMENT AGENT

AND/OR UNDERWRITER) AND DOES NOT TYPICALLY OWN ANY

EQUITY TRANCHES ISSUED. ONCE THE CDO VEHICLE CLOSES

AND ISSUES SECURITIES, THE FIRM HAS NO FURTHER

OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT TO THE

VEHICLE. AT THE TIME OF CLOSING, THE FIRM MAY HOLD

UNSOLD SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM WAS NOT ABLE TO

PLACE WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE AMOUNT OF

UNSOLD SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

WAS INSIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ON

OCCASION HOLD SOME OF THE CDO VEHICLES SECURITIES, INCLUDING

EQUITY INTERESTS,

AS A SECONDARY MARKET-MAKER OR AS A PRINCIPAL

INVESTOR, OR IT MAY BE A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO

THE VEHICLES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THESE

AMOUNTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. EXPOSURES TO CDO

WAREHOUSE VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WERE

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

INVESTMENT IN A THIRD-PARTY CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST

THE FIRM HOLDS A NOTE IN A THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED

VIE, WHICH IS A CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUST

(THE TRUST), THAT OWNS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

ISSUED BY A NATIONAL RETAILER. THE NOTE IS

STRUCTURED SO THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT CAN FLOAT

UP TO 47% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE

RECEIVABLES HELD BY THE TRUST NOT TO EXCEED $4.2

BILLION. THE FIRM IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

THE

TRUST AND ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT AS AN AFS

SECURITY, WHICH IS RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE AMORTIZED COST OF

THE NOTE WAS $3.6 BILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS

$2.6 BILLION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING

FOR AFS SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 158162

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

VIE USED IN FRBNY TRANSACTION

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, IN

JUNE 2008, THE FRBNY TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH AN LLC

FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF A PORTFOLIO OF $30.0

BILLION IN ASSETS, BASED UPON THE VALUE OF THE

PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE

LLC WERE FUNDED BY A

$28.85 BILLION TERM LOAN FROM THE FRBNY, AND A

$1.15 BILLION SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN IS SUBORDINATED TO

THE FRBNY LOAN AND WILL BEAR THE FIRST $1.15

BILLION OF ANY LOSSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. ANY

REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT

OF THE FRBNY LOAN, THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN AND THE

EXPENSE OF THE LLC, WILL BE FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE

FRBNY.

OTHER VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES

STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR,

UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT, TRUSTEE OR

CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT

ARMS LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE

BASED UPON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE,

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT

CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIES OR TO RECEIVE A

MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIES,

JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS

ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS SIMILAR TO THE

WAY IT WOULD RECORD AND REPORT POSITIONS FROM ANY

OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. THESE TRANSACTIONS

ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR DISCLOSURE

PURPOSES UNDER FIN 46(R).

NOTE 18

 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. INSTEAD, IT IS

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142

AT THE REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY

ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 37 ON PAGES 214215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY (WHICH

IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). GOODWILL IS TESTED

ANNUALLY (DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE OFTEN

IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES

IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE

IMPAIRMENT. MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING

UNITS.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THE FUTURE EARNINGS

POTENTIAL OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS CAN AFFECT

THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, IF THE

CURRENT PERIOD OF WEAK ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS

PERSISTS, THEN THIS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

ESTIMATES MANAGEMENT USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DETERMINED

TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED

BUT ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE

FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. THE

IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED

TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, SUCH AS CORE DEPOSITS AND

CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST

REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE INTANGIBLE

ASSET; IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED PERIODICALLY

ON THESE AMORTIZING INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE

RIGHT TO

PERFORM SPECIFIED MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES

(PREDOMINANTLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGES) FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED

FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR

SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST,

AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX AND

INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF BORROWERS;

MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF

THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

AS

PERMITTED BY SFAS 156, THE FIRM ELECTED TO FAIR VALUE MSRS AS

ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS. THE FIRM DEFINED MSRS AS ONE CLASS

BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS TO MEASURE MSR FAIR VALUE

AND ITS TREATMENT OF MSRS AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES.

THE FIRM INITIALLY CAPITALIZES MSRS BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL

RECOGNITION. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF

MSRS FOR INITIAL CAPITALIZATION AND ONGOING

VALUATION USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL,

WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE

INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL AND THEN

DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES.

THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,

CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER

ANCILLARY REVENUE AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND

PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET

CONDITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET

PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR

ASSET. DURING 2007 AND 2008, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO

REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY PAYMENT MODEL BASED UPON A

NUMBER OF MARKET-RELATED FACTORS, INCLUDING A

DOWNWARD TREND IN HOME PRICES, GENERAL TIGHTENING

OF CREDIT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE ASSOCIATED

IMPACT ON REFINANCING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM COMPARES

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES OR HAS USED

COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND TRADING INSTRUMENTS

TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE

INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. MSRS DECREASE

IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY,

SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES),

PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES

(WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES

DECLINE.

ALL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DURING 2008, PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS,

OTHER CREDIT CARD-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND CORE

DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES DECREASED $727 MILLION,

ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ESTABLISHED A TEMPORARY LENDING

FACILITY, THE AML FACILITY, TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO ELIGIBLE U.S. MONEY MARKET MUTUAL

FUNDS (MMMFS). UNDER THE AML FACILITY, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MUST USE THE LOAN PROCEEDS

TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES OF ELIGIBLE HIGH-QUALITY ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER (ABCP)

INVESTMENTS FROM MMMFS, WHICH ARE PLEDGED TO SECURE NONRECOURSE ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BANK OF BOSTON (FRBB). PARTICIPATING BANKING ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT BEAR ANY

CREDIT OR MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE ABCP INVESTMENTS THEY HOLD UNDER THIS FACILITY;

THEREFORE, THE ABCP INVESTMENTS HELD ARE NOT ASSESSED ANY REGULATORY CAPITAL. THE AML

FACILITY WILL BE IN EFFECT UNTIL OCTOBER 30, 2009. THE NONRECOURSE ADVANCES FROM THE FRBB

WERE ELECTED UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AND RECORDED IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; THE

CORRESPONDING ABCP INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO ELECTED UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AND RECORDED

TERM FUNDS TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BORROW UNDER THE PRIMARY CREDIT

PROGRAM. THE TAF ALLOWS ALL ELIGIBLE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO PLACE A BID FOR AN ADVANCE

FROM ITS LOCAL FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AT AN INTEREST RATE SET BY AN AUCTION. ALL ADVANCES

ARE REQUIRED TO BE FULLY COLLATERALIZED. THE TAF IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY BY

MAKING IT EASIER FOR SOUND INSTITUTIONS TO BORROW WHEN THE MARKETS ARE NOT OPERATING

EFFICIENTLY. THE TAF DOES NOT HAVE A FIXED EXPIRATION DATE.

ON JULY 15, 2008, EACH SERIES OF BEAR STEARNS

PREFERRED STOCK THEN ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING WAS

EXCHANGED INTO A SERIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

PREFERRED STOCK

(CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E, SERIES F

AND SERIES G) HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL

TERMS. AS A RESULT OF THE EXCHANGE, THESE

PREFERRED SHARES RANK EQUALLY WITH THE OTHER

SERIES OF THE FIRMS PREFERRED STOCK.

ON AUGUST 21, 2008, THE FIRM ISSUED 180,000

SHARES OF 8.625% NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES J (SERIES J).

ON OCTOBER 28, 2008, PURSUANT TO THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS (THE U.S. TREASURY)

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM (THE CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM), THE FIRM ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY, IN

EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $25.0 BILLION, (I)

2.5 MILLION SHARES OF THE FIRMS FIXED RATE

CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES K, PAR

VALUE $1 PER SHARE AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE

$10,000 PER SHARE (THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK),

AND (II) A WARRANT TO PURCHASE 88,401,697 SHARES OF

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE

OF $42.42 PER SHARE (THE WARRANT). THE $25.0

BILLION PROCEEDS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK AND THE WARRANT BASED ON THE

RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INITIAL CARRYING VALUE OF

$23.7 BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK AND ITS REDEMPTION VALUE OF $25.0

BILLION WILL BE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS (WITH

A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK) OVER THE FIRST FIVE

YEARS OF THE CONTRACT AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

DIVIDEND YIELD USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD.

THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK IS NON-VOTING,

QUALIFIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL AND RANKS EQUALLY WITH

THE FIRMS OTHER SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

IN THE EVENT OF A LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION OF

THE FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASES PREFERRED STOCK THEN

OUTSTANDING TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER THE FIRMS

COMMON STOCK FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND THE

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS.

GENERALLY, DIVIDENDS ON SHARES OF OUTSTANDING

SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY.

DIVIDENDS ON THE SHARES OF SERIES I PREFERRED STOCK

ARE PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY AT A FIXED ANNUAL DIVIDEND

RATE OF 7.90% THROUGH APRIL 2018, AND THEN BECOME

PAYABLE QUARTERLY AT AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF

THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 3.47%.

DIVIDENDS ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON THE SERIES K

PREFERRED STOCK AT A FIXED ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF

5% FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS, AND A FIXED ANNUAL

DIVIDEND RATE OF 9% THEREAFTER. THE EFFECTIVE

DIVIDEND YIELD OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK IS

6.16%.

FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.

DURING 2007 AND 2006, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 168

MILLION SHARES AND 91 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY,

OF COMMON STOCK UNDER STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED IN APRIL 2007, A

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE

REPURCHASE OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS

COMMON SHARES, WHICH SUPERSEDED AN $8.0 BILLION

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2006. THE

$10.0 BILLION AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE

REPURCHASED TO OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF

SHARES THAT MAY BE REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL

CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION

(TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES);

INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE

POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR

TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET

PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR

UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE

SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE

PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE SHARES DURING

PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING

COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL

TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A

RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A

PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM

IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS

ABILITY TO REPURCHASE THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK, SEE

NOTE 24 ABOVE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 524 MILLION

UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED FOR

ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE,

COMPENSATION, OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS,

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PLANS AND THE WARRANT ISSUED

TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE

PROGRAM AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

NOTE

26  EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. BASIC EPS IS

COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO

COMMON STOCK BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF

COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED

EPS IS COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHOD FOR THE

NUMERATOR AS BASIC EPS BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, THE

NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES REFLECT, IN ADDITION TO

OUTSTANDING SHARES, THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT

COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES OR OTHER

CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR

EXERCISED INTO COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME AVAILABLE

FOR

COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED

EPS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO CONVERTIBLE

SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET

INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK WERE NECESSARY.

BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

NOTE 28

 INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A

CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET-AND-LIABILITY METHOD

REQUIRED BY SFAS 109 AS AMENDED BY FIN 48 TO

PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS

METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES.

ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR

EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT

WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE

REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES

INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT

EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO

REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE

NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A

SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE

MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN

CHASE AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE

FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR

SEVERAL YEARS. THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT

THAN THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED.

THE COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX

EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH

PERIOD DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CERTAIN

TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TABLE DOES NOT

REFLECT THE CUMULATIVE TAX EFFECTS OF INITIALLY

IMPLEMENTING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN 2007

AND 2006. THE TAX EFFECT OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED

DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS AN INCREASE IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $3.0 BILLION, $159 MILLION

AND $885 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON

THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE

BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF

TIME. DURING 2008, AS PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES

PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES,

COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

AND STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND

NEEDS, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, FOR WHICH

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAD BEEN PROVIDED, WILL

REMAIN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND THE CURRENT

AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES. AS

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF

THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS

U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE

DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THIS DETERMINATION RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF AN

INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. FOR 2008, PRETAX

EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION WERE

GENERATED THAT WILL REMAIN INDEFINITELY INVESTED IN

THESE SUBSIDIARIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS

IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $12.9 BILLION.

IF THE FIRM WERE TO RECORD A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, THE

AMOUNT WOULD BE $2.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES

GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006

WAS $608 MILLION, $60 MILLION AND $(219) MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

LOSS AND BUSINESS TAX CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS. THE

U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION, THE STATE AND LOCAL NET

OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.2

BILLION, AND THE BUSINESS TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD

OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION ARE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL

LIMITATIONS ON UTILIZATION. IF NOT UTILIZED, THE

NET OPERATING LOSSES WOULD EXPIRE IN 2026, 2027 AND

2028, AND THE BUSINESS TAX CREDITS WOULD EXPIRE IN

2028. IN ADDITION, AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX

CREDIT CARRY-FORWARD HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION AND HAS AN INDEFINITE

CARRYFORWARD PERIOD.

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATING TO

STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSSES, LOSSES

ASSOCIATED WITH NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND LOSSES

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS. THE

INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR TO 2008 IS LARGELY RELATED TO BEAR STEARNS.

THE FIRM ADOPTED AND APPLIED FIN 48, WHICH

ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX

POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN, AND ALSO

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION,

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM

PERIODS AND DISCLOSURE, TO ALL OF ITS

INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE

OF JANUARY 1, 2007, RESULTING IN A $436 MILLION

CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS, A

REDUCTION IN GOODWILL OF $113 MILLION AND A $549

MILLION DECREASE IN THE LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, JPMORGAN CHASES

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES, WERE

$5.9 BILLION AND $4.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $2.9 BILLION AND

$1.3 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE THE

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS JPMORGAN CHASE IS

PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAX

AUTHORITIES, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

CHANGE OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD ALSO

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT JPMORGAN CHASES QUARTERLY AND

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATES.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX

EXAMINATIONS BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES OF THE VARIOUS

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S.

FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS. THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL

THE BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.) IS SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE BANK IS A

MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, AND ITS

DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 20 ON

PAGE 190 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) REQUIRES DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF

RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK

SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS

WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION IN 2008 AND 2007.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE

LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH

SECURED LOANS

TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY

LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL

CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH LOANS

IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL

CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME

(ON A PARENT COMPANYONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND

INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE

OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND

RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE

AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT

OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY

SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION,

PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2009 AND 2008, JPMORGAN CHASES

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$17.0 BILLION AND $16.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR

RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY

DIVIDENDS IN 2009 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS

ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF

$20.8 BILLION AND $16.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS

FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE

OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL.

TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL

INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING

PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS GOODWILL

AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF

PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1,

SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY CAPITAL IS

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, JPMORGAN CHASE

IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1

AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2)

CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM

LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1

CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ADJUSTED ON-BALANCE SHEET

ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION.

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE

CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY

REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE GRANTED THE FIRM, FOR A PERIOD

OF 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER,

RELIEF UP TO A CERTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNT AND

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVES RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO BEAR STEARNS

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OTHER EXPOSURES ACQUIRED.

THE AMOUNT OF SUCH RELIEF IS SUBJECT TO REDUCTION

BY ONE-SIXTH EACH QUARTER SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 32  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO

INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR

MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST RATE PRICES

OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN

DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO IS AN END-USER

OF DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO HEDGE OR MANAGE RISKS OF

MARKET EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE

CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES

ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES. SFAS

133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138, SFAS 149, SFAS 155 AND

FSP FAS 133-1, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

THOSE USED FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS.

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES ARE REQUIRED TO BE

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR

VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A

DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE CONTRACT

HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES,

WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR

NOT, ARE RECORDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING

LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 6 ON PAGE 147 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DERIVATIVES USED FOR TRADING PURPOSES

THE FIRM MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS

SEEKING TO MODIFY, OR REDUCE INTEREST RATE, CREDIT,

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY AND OTHER

MARKET RISKS OR FOR RISK-TAKING PURPOSES. THE FIRM

TYPICALLY MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE FROM SUCH

DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVES OR OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY

OFFSET THE EXPOSURE FROM THE CLIENT TRANSACTION.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES ANY RESIDUAL EXPOSURE AND

SEEKS TO EARN A SPREAD BETWEEN THE CLIENT

DERIVATIVES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS. FOR THE

FIRMS OWN ACCOUNT, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVES TO

TAKE RISK POSITIONS OR TO BENEFIT FROM DIFFERENCES

IN PRICES BETWEEN DERIVATIVE MARKETS AND MARKETS

FOR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES ARE

UTILIZED IN THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS CAUSED BY

INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. AS A RESULT OF INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET

VALUE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO FIXED-RATE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS ARE

EXPECTED TO OFFSET SUBSTANTIALLY THIS UNREALIZED

APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION. INTEREST INCOME AND

INTEREST EXPENSE ON VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ON FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS INCREASE

OR

DECREASE AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT

ARE LINKED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OFFSET SUBSTANTIALLY

THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED-RATE AND

VARIABLE-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE

CONTRACTED NOTIONAL AMOUNT. FORWARD CONTRACTS USED

FOR THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY ARRANGEMENTS TO EXCHANGE

CASH IN THE FUTURE

BASED ON PRICE MOVEMENTS OF SPECIFIED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. FUTURES CONTRACTS USED ARE PRIMARILY

INDEX FUTURES WHICH PROVIDE FOR CASH PAYMENTS BASED

UPON THE MOVEMENTS OF AN UNDERLYING RATE INDEX.

THE FIRM USES FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

(I.E., NON-U.S.) ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN

CURRENCY, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS EQUITY INVESTMENTS

IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS CHANGE.

GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT

ARE LINKED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

ARE EXPECTED TO OFFSET SUBSTANTIALLY THIS

VARIABILITY. FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS

REPRESENT AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE THE CURRENCY OF

ONE COUNTRY FOR THE CURRENCY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY AT

AN AGREED-UPON PRICE ON AN AGREED-UPON SETTLEMENT

DATE.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE

OVERALL PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOLD

INVENTORY IN ITS COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT

OF GOLD PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

GOLD INVENTORY CHANGES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO GOLD

INVENTORY ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION. FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED FOR THE FIRMS GOLD INVENTORY RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE ARRANGEMENTS TO DELIVER

GOLD IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS

EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN

THE ENTITY REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES

A CREDIT EVENT SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO

PAY AN OBLIGATION WHEN DUE. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE

DISCUSSION BELOW.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A

DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE

BEING HEDGED. IN ORDER FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE

DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THERE MUST BE DOCUMENTATION

OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY,

INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT,

THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK EXPOSURE, AND HOW

EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND

RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM

USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION

ANALYSIS, AS WELL

AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR VALUE

COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH

FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A

HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN AND IS EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING OFFSETTING

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS MUST BE

ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST QUARTERLY. ANY

INEFFECTIVENESS MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD

EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS

NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED

EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED

ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES

202

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE ITEM AND

CONTINUES TO BE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD

ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED

CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED

OCCUR, CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY.

FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED

BECAUSE THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED

TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY

RELATED DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES,

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE

REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED

DEBT INSTRUMENT ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY

INCLUDE HEDGES OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK INHERENT

IN FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, WAREHOUSE LOANS, AFS

SECURITIES, AND THE OVERALL PRICE OF GOLD

INVENTORY. ALL CHANGES IN THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH

THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY

NET INTEREST INCOME FOR LONG-TERM DEBT AND AFS

SECURITIES; OTHER INCOME FOR WAREHOUSE LOANS; AND

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR GOLD INVENTORY.

THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GAINS OR LOSSES

DURING 2008, 2007 OR 2006 ON FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT

NO LONGER QUALIFIED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH

FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN

CURRENCYDENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. ALL

HEDGING DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE

RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF

THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST

INCOME.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

AND FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS

TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN

SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE

U.S. DOLLAR. THE PORTION OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVE

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

(I.E., FORWARD POINTS) IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST

INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE FIRMS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TO PURCHASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED

TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS

BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH

CONTRACTS AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133. SIMILARLY, THE

FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES USED AS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

$348 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) OF NET LOSSES RECORDED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS ARE HEDGED IS TEN YEARS, AND SUCH

TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY RELATE TO CORE LENDING AND

BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE

VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD PARTY ISSUER (THE

REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE

PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO

ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT

DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS THE

PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS

UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH

AS A BANKRUPTCY, FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION, OR

A RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION

RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION, BUT

HAS THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT

REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECTED TO A

CREDIT EVENT.

THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF CREDIT

PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND

USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES.

FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY

AS A MARKET-MAKER IN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS,

THE FIRM ACTIVELY RISK MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES BY PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT

PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT

OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. AS A

SELLER OF PROTECTION, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO A

GIVEN REFERENCE ENTITY MAY BE OFFSET PARTIALLY, OR

ENTIRELY, WITH A CONTRACT TO PURCHASE PROTECTION

FROM ANOTHER COUNTERPARTY ON THE SAME OR SIMILAR

REFERENCE ENTITY. SECOND, THE FIRM USES CREDIT

DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE FIRMS CREDIT

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AND TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT

LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS)

AS WELL AS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES

129143 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MORTGAGE-RELATED

EXPOSURES. IN ACCOMPLISHING THE ABOVE, THE FIRM

USES DIFFERENT TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.

FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2008 ANNUAL REPORT

203

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF

EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (SINGLE-NAME) OR

A BROAD-BASED INDEX, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION

ON BOTH SINGLE-NAME AND INDEX-REFERENCE

OBLIGATIONS. SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

(CDS) AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE BOTH OTC

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED TO

MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE

ENTITY, WHILE CDS INDEX ARE USED TO MANAGE CREDIT

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR

CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND OTHER

MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX IS COMPRISED OF A

PORTFOLIO OF CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE ENTITIES.

NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE ESTABLISHED

APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX MONTHS WITH A NEW

UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO

REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF

THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A

CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT

DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX AND IS REPLACED

WITH ANOTHER REFERENCE ENTITY. CDS CAN ALSO BE

REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCE

NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED

ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE

PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST $1 MILLION OF REALIZED

CREDIT LOSSES IN A $10 MILLION PORTFOLIO OF

EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS

TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS,

UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, UNDER THE

TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS

CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE ENTITY. THE

PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION

SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE VALUE OF

THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLING THE

CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE

RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER DOES NOT

NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING

REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AMOUNTS DUE

UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES

A CREDIT LINKED NOTE (CLN) IS A FUNDED CREDIT

DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CLN PURCHASES

CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCED ENTITY FROM THE

NOTE INVESTOR. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR

PAYS THE ISSUER PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN RETURN, THE

ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR,

BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE REFERENCED ENTITY.

THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE

OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS THE REFERENCE ENTITY

EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT. IN THAT

EVENT, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE PAR

VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS THE

INVESTOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AND

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED REFERENCE

OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY

TO THE CLN HAS RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE

ENTITY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CLNS, SEE NOTE

17 ON PAGES 182183 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES THE FIRM SOLD AND PURCHASED,

AND THE NET POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. UPON

A CREDIT EVENT, THE FIRM AS SELLER OF PROTECTION

WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE

FULL NOTIONAL OF NET PROTECTION SOLD; AS THE AMOUNT

THAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE

CONTRACTS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF

THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT.

THE FIRM MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY

PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE

ENTITIES; AS SUCH OTHER PROTECTION PURCHASED

REFERENCED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT

NOT IDENTICAL REFERENCE POSITIONS, INCLUDING

INDICES, PORTFOLIO COVERAGE AND OTHER REFERENCE

POINTS, WHICH FURTHER MITIGATES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET PROTECTION

SOLD.

COMMERCIAL PAPER TO BELOW CERTAIN PREDETERMINED

THRESHOLDS. THE COMMITMENT PERIOD IS GENERALLY ONE

TO THREE YEARS. THE AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS RELATED

TO VARIABLE-RATE DEMAND BONDS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER

OF U.S. DOMESTIC STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES,

HOSPITALS AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS $23.5 BILLION AND $24.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND

CREDIT ARE COMMITMENTS TO INVESTMENT AND

NONINVESTMENT GRADE COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION

WITH LEVERAGED ACQUISITIONS. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THE ACQUISITION BY THE

BORROWER IS SUCCESSFUL, TEND TO BE SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE AND, IN MOST CASES, ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

CONDITIONS BASED ON THE BORROWERS FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OTHER FACTORS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM

OFTEN SYNDICATES PORTIONS OF THE COMMITMENT TO

OTHER INVESTORS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

THESE COMMITMENTS OFTEN CONTAIN FLEXIBLE PRICING

FEATURES TO ADJUST FOR CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS

PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALTERNATIVELY, THE BORROWER MAY

TURN TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS FOR REQUIRED FUNDING

INSTEAD OF DRAWING ON THE COMMITMENT PROVIDED BY

THE FIRM, AND THE COMMITMENT MAY EXPIRE UNUSED. AS

SUCH, THESE COMMITMENTS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE

INDICATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL RISK, AND THE TOTAL

COMMITMENT AMOUNT MAY NOT REFLECT ACTUAL FUTURE

CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS

RELATED TO LEVERAGED ACQUISITIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007, WAS $3.6 BILLION AND $8.2 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 4

AND NOTE 5 ON PAGES 129143 AND 144146,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FIN 45 GUARANTEES

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A

GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A

GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING

THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A

CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR

TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES

IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY

SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD

PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED

AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS TO

BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45: CERTAIN

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, STANDBY LETTERS OF

CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING

INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THESE GUARANTEES ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL

BELOW.

THE FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION OF THE OBLIGATION

UNDERTAKEN WHEN ISSUING THE GUARANTEES AND

COMMITMENTS THAT QUALIFY UNDER FIN 45 IS TYPICALLY

EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE AMOUNT

OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM

HAS RECORDED THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH

AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. AS

CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, IT IS APPLIED

TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS,

AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT

INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING &

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE

CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO

FIN 45 GUARANTEES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $535

MILLION AND $335 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE

NOT GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE

PRINCIPALLY USED AS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY TO SPES, PREDOMINANTLY MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 177181

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE

AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO PERFORM

UNDER THEIR ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE

CONDUIT AT ANY TIME. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE

FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT

ABOVE THE ASSETS THEN FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT

PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE

REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN

MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF

THE SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON

THESE AGREEMENTS.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF

$147 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, CLASSIFIED IN

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDES $9 MILLION

FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

AND $138 MILLION FOR THE FIN 45 GUARANTEE

LIABILITY.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT (SBLC) AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY THE

FIRM TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO

A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS

COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS,

ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE AND SIMILAR

TRANSACTIONS. THE MAJORITY OF SBLCS MATURE IN 5 YEARS OR LESS; AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, 64%

AND 52%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS MATURE

WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE FIRM HAS RECOURSE TO

RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER

THESE GUARANTEES; IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD

CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT

THESE GUARANTEES. THE CARRYING VALUE OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF

$673 MILLION AND $590 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDES

$276 MILLION AND $255 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS,

AND $397 MILLION AND $335 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY FOR THE FIN 45 GUARANTEE.

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE

FIRM TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT

MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN

45. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS

THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON

EXERCISE BY THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE

BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM MAY

ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT OPTION CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO

MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE

TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY FIVE

YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE

CONTRACTS SUCH AS STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT

REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK

VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF

ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT MARKET

VALUE IS LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER

CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES,

COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS STABLE VALUE WRAPS, ARE

TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO REALIZE

INVESTMENT RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN

UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO, AND TYPICALLY HAVE

A LONGER-TERM MATURITY OR ALLOW EITHER PARTY TO TERMINATE THE

CONTRACT SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED TERMS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE IN

TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES. THE TOTAL

NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM

DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS $83.8 BILLION AND $85.3

RESPECTIVELY. THE NOTIONAL VALUE GENERALLY

REPRESENTS THE FIRMS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS

GUARANTEES, ALTHOUGH EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN STABLE

VALUE DERIVATIVES IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL

VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS REFLECTS THE

PROBABILITY OF WHETHER THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FAIR VALUE RELATED

TO DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES WAS A DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLE OF $184 MILLION AND $213 MILLION AND A

DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $5.6 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE

FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY

ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS, OR BY

ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK

RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES.

IN

ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A

GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45, THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF

CREDIT PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 32 ON PAGES 202-205 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

THROUGH THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM,

CUSTOMERS SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND

NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD

PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM PROVIDES

AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING AGREEMENTS WHICH

PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE

THIRD-PARTY BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES

IN THE EVENT THE FIRM DID NOT OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

COLLATERAL. TO MINIMIZE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THESE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS CASH

OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET

VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES

ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO

MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION

IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM

THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL

MAY BE RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS, THE

FIRM WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE

REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT

THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT

THEREOF.

ALSO, AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM INVESTS

CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED GUIDELINES.

BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT RISK OF LOSS UNDER ITS

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IS REMOTE.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS,

THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN

TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A

TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO

SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN LIEU OF

MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE.

THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION

CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF

SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (SOFTWARE LICENSEES) OR WHEN

IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY

(THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS), PURSUANT TO WHICH IT

INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF

LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO

THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY

PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS

TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS

OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER

THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS

WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN

TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST

THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED

UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE

RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

INDEMNIFICATIONS FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 AND NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 163166 AND 168176, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM GENERALLY MAKES

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN ITS LOAN SALE AND

SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET

CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY REQUIRE

THE FIRM (INCLUDING IN ITS ROLES AS A SERVICER) TO

REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER

OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF

SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. GENERALLY, THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES UNDER THESE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WOULD BE EQUAL TO

THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD BY SUCH

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES PLUS, IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH

LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE FIRM HAD RECORDED A

REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF $1.1 BILLION AND $15

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND

CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A

RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE

SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS

THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS

(I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE

SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK

WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS THE

FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION OR THE

FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION OR A PRIVATE

INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON

RECOURSE SERVICING PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES

PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE LESS THAN

THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST

ON THE LOAN AND THE COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING

PROPERTY. THE FIRMS LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN

EXECUTED ON A NONRECOURSE BASIS, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF

FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL

BALANCE OF LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE TOTALED $15.0

BILLION AND $557 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN LOANS

SOLD WITH RECOURSE BETWEEN DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WAS DRIVEN

BY THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITY THAT THE

FIRM HAD RECORDED, WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

FIRMS VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD IT WILL HAVE TO

PERFORM UNDER THIS GUARANTEE, WAS $241 MILLION AND

ZERO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1, 2008, THE FIRM WAS A PARTNER

WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT VENTURE OPERATING UNDER

THE NAME OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC (THE

JOINT VENTURE). THE JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN

OCTOBER 2005, AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT BY THE

FIRM AND FIRST DATA CORPORATION, ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNER, TO INTEGRATE THE COMPANIES JOINTLY-OWNED

CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND PAYMENTECH MERCHANT

BUSINESSES. THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDED MERCHANT

PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

209

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CANADA. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE

WAS COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2008, AND JPMORGAN

CHASE RETAINED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE BUSINESS

UNDER THE CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS NAME.

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD

INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS LIABLE

PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT

CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A

DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A

DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS FAVOR,

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS WILL (THROUGH THE

CARDMEMBERS ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE

AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE

TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE

MERCHANT, CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR

THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER.

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS MITIGATES THIS RISK BY

WITHHOLDING FUTURE SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH

RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY.

HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT

CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER

PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; (2) CHASE

PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER

REFUNDS; AND (3) CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS DOES

NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD

BE LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, CHASE PAYMENTECH

SOLUTIONS INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $13

MILLION ON $713.9 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME

PROCESSED, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IT HELD $222

MILLION OF COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2007, THE JOINT VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE

CREDIT LOSSES OF $10 MILLION ON $719.1 BILLION OF

AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, AND AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $779 MILLION OF

COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED UPON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, THE AMOUNT OF THE

FIRMS CHARGE BACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS, WHICH IS

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAYMENT OR PERFORMANCE RISK

TO THE FIRM, IS IMMATERIAL.

CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATION, EXCHANGE AND

CLEARINGHOUSE GUARANTEES

THE FIRM HOLDS AN EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC.

DURING OCTOBER 2007, CERTAIN VISA-RELATED ENTITIES

COMPLETED A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS TO

COMBINE THEIR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING VISA USA, UNDER

ONE HOLDING COMPANY, VISA INC. UPON THE

RESTRUCTURING, THE FIRMS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN

VISA USA WAS CONVERTED INTO AN EQUITY INTEREST IN

VISA INC. VISA INC. SOLD SHARES VIA AN INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING AND USED A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS

FROM THE OFFERING TO REDEEM A PORTION OF THE FIRMS

EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC. PRIOR TO THE

RESTRUCTURING, VISA USAS BY-LAWS OBLIGATED THE

FIRM UPON DEMAND BY VISA USA TO INDEMNIFY VISA USA

FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION OBLIGATIONS OF

VISA USA. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT GUARANTEE WAS NOT

SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER FIN 45,

BECAUSE THE GUARANTEE WAS IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 45. UPON THE RESTRUCTURING

EVENT, THE FIRMS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY VISA INC.

WAS LIMITED TO CERTAIN IDENTIFIED LITIGATIONS. SUCH

A LIMITATION IS DEEMED A MODIFICATION OF THE

INDEMNITY BY-LAW AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS NOW SUBJECT

TO THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 45. THE VALUE OF THE

LITIGATION GUARANTEE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON ITS FAIR

VALUE; THE NET AMOUNT RECORDED (WITHIN OTHER

LIABILITIES) DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO VISA, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF OTHER

ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING SEVERAL SECURITIES AND

FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES, BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN

SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO

PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE

ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER

MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT

ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO

MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO

THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE

FIRMS CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTEE FUND,

OR, IN A FEW CASES, THE OBLIGATION MAY BE

UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS,

SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE

CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE

NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO

BE REMOTE.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, THE

FIRM SUCCEEDED TO AN OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENT

FOR THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 383 MADISON AVENUE IN

NEW YORK CITY (THE SYNTHETIC LEASE). UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE SYNTHETIC LEASE, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED

TO MAKE PERIODIC PAYMENTS BASED ON THE LESSORS

UNDERLYING INTEREST COSTS. THE SYNTHETIC LEASE

EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 1, 2010. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SYNTHETIC LEASE, THE FIRM HAS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE

THE BUILDING FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING

INDEBTEDNESS OF THE LESSOR, OR TO ARRANGE FOR THE

SALE OF THE BUILDING, WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE

TO BE USED TO SATISFY THE LESSORS DEBT OBLIGATION.

IF THE SALE DOES NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS

TO SATISFY THE LESSORS DEBT OBLIGATION, THE FIRM

IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE SHORTFALL UP TO A MAXIMUM

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THERE WAS NO EXPECTED SHORTFALL, AND THE MAXIMUM

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WAS APPROXIMATELY $670

MILLION. UNDER A SEPARATE GROUND LEASE, THE LAND ON

WHICH THE BUILDING IS BUILT WAS LEASED TO AN

AFFILIATE OF BEAR STEARNS WHICH, AS PART OF THE

SYNTHETIC LEASE, ASSIGNED THIS POSITION TO THE

SYNTHETIC LEASE LESSOR. THE OWNER OF THE LAND SUED

THE FIRM, ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE

MERGER AGREEMENT VIOLATED A RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

PROVISION OF THE GROUND LEASE. THE FIRMS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE LAWSUIT WAS GRANTED, AND A JUDGMENT OF

DISMISSAL WAS ENTERED ON JANUARY 12, 2009. THE

OWNER HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL.

NOTE 34  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A

NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME

GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR

ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY

TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS

OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN

DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS

SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND

REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS

NEEDED TO REFLECT MANAGEMENTS RISK TOLERANCE.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK

CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY

AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION, AND MONITORED REGULARLY

210

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2008 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND

ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE

FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH

LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATION, LOAN SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER

RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. IN THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY

BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A

KEY FOCUS ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE

PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL RISK

CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN

UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE LOAN

PRODUCT WITH VARYING TERMS (E.G., INTEREST-ONLY

PAYMENTS FOR AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD, OPTION ARMS)

OR EXPOSURE TO LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS

WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL

COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT WHEN

EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES.

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF

WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE FDIC FOR $1.9 BILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED EXCEEDED THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 141, NONFINANCIAL ASSETS THAT ARE NOT HELD-FOR-SALE, SUCH AS PREMISES AND

EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE

WRITTEN DOWN AGAINST THAT NEGATIVE GOODWILL. THE NEGATIVE GOODWILL THAT REMAINED AFTER

WRITING DOWN NONFINANCIAL ASSETS WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED $5.8 BILLION OF

HIGHER QUALITY CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM THE LEGACY CHASE PORTFOLIO TO A

SECURITIZATION TRUST PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL

(THE TRUST). AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING HIGHER CREDIT

QUALITY CHASE-ORIGINATED ON-BOOK RECEIVABLES TO THE TRUSTS

SELLERS INTEREST WHICH HAS A HIGHER OVERALL LOSS RATE

REFLECTIVE OF THE TOTAL ASSETS WITHIN THE TRUST, APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS RECORDED

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS INCREMENTAL PROVISION EXPENSE WAS

RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AS THE ACTION RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUALS BANKING OPERATIONS. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 169-170 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(G)

MANAGED RESULTS FOR CREDIT CARD EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CS

SECURITIZATIONS ON TOTAL NET REVENUE, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AVERAGE ASSETS, AS

JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN

EVALUATING THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO AS

OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED, AND DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES SUCH AS

EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED UPON MANAGED INFORMATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ELIMINATED IN

RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. THE RELATED

SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (I) LIMITED

DOCUMENTATION; (II) HIGH COMBINED-LOAN-TO-VALUE

(CLTV) RATIO; (III) LOANS SECURED BY NON-OWNER

OCCUPIED PROPERTIES; OR (IV) DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO

ABOVE NORMAL LIMITS. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

CHARACTERISTIC IS LIMITED DOCUMENTATION. A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

A FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY, OR MINIMUM

PAYMENT. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON AN OPTION ARM LOAN

IS BASED UPON THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE

INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE HAS

USUALLY BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED

RATE. THE FULLY INDEXED RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN

INDEX RATE PLUS A MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY

PERIOD ENDS, THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED

ON THE LOAN INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE AND

ADJUSTS MONTHLY TO REFLECT MOVEMENTS IN THE INDEX.

THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO

COVER INTEREST ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR MONTH, AND ANY

UNPAID INTEREST IS DEFERRED AND ADDED TO THE

PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN.

PRIME

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS GENERALLY HAVE LOW DEFAULT

RISK AND ARE MADE TO BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT

RECORDS AND A MONTHLY INCOME THAT IS AT LEAST

THREE TO FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THEIR MONTHLY

HOUSING EXPENSE (MORTGAGE PAYMENTS PLUS TAXES AND

OTHER DEBT PAYMENTS). THESE BORROWERS PROVIDE FULL

DOCUMENTATION AND GENERALLY HAVE RELIABLE PAYMENT

HISTORIES.

SUBPRIME

SUBPRIME LOANS ARE DESIGNED FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ONE

OR MORE HIGH RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BUT

NOT LIMITED TO: (I) UNRELIABLE OR POOR PAYMENT

HISTORIES; (II) HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) RATIO OF

GREATER THAN 80% (WITHOUT BORROWER-PAID MORTGAGE

INSURANCE); (III) HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO; (IV)

(A)

THE AVERAGE YIELD WAS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND

DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE

EFFECT OF RELATED DERIVATIVES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF

PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS

ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(B)

INCLUDES CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND OTHER

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

(C)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGE 159. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS WAS $2.5 BILLION, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE

OBLIGATIONS WAS $75.4 BILLION AND OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $14.0 BILLION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS

AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WAS $58

MILLION. THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

(D)

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY OF TEN YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES MORTGAGED-BACKED

SECURITIES (MBSS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) ARE DUE IN TEN YEARS

OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED

FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR

YEARS FOR MBSS AND CMOS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES WERE THE

ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES EXCEEDED 10% OF

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC)

GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF

CROSS-BORDER RISK. BASED ON FFIEC GUIDELINES,

BEGINNING IN 2006 SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS ARE ALLOCATED TO A COUNTRY BASED UPON

THE DOMICILE OF THE COUNTERPARTY. ADDITIONALLY,

LOCAL FOREIGN OFFICE COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

COMMITMENTS; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM

COMMITMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF THE DATES

SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN

EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC

METHODOLOGIES ARE: THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

DERIVATIVES; NET LOCAL COUNTRY ASSETS ARE REDUCED

BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF

CURRENCY DENOMINATION); AND SECURITIES PURCHASED

UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE

COUNTERPARTY, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING

SECURITY COLLATERAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS

TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE

AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING

RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES EMERGING

MARKETS CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE, SEE EMERGING
