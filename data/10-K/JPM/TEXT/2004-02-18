ON JANUARY 14, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE) AND BANK ONE

CORPORATION (BANK ONE) ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO MERGE. THE MERGER AGREEMENT

BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK ONE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BOARDS OF

DIRECTORS OF BOTH COMPANIES. THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE

SHAREHOLDERS OF BOTH INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND

NON-U.S.

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN

MID-2004. SEE AGREEMENT TO MERGE WITH BANK ONE CORPORATION ON PAGE 24 FOR A

FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER.

THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

DOES NOT GIVE

EFFECT TO THE MERGER.

OVERVIEW

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

JPMORGAN CHASE WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

WITH $771 BILLION IN ASSETS AND $46 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM WITH OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN

50 COUNTRIES. ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK), A NEW YORK BANKING CORPORATION HEADQUARTERED IN NEW

YORK CITY, AND CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE USA),

HEADQUARTERED IN DELAWARE. THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMSI).

THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL

AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND

AFFILIATED BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE

FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO

THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED, PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND

POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND OTHER

SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE INTERNALLY ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING

PURPOSES, INTO FIVE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS (INVESTMENT BANK, TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING, JPMORGAN PARTNERS

AND CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES). A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES ARE

DISCUSSED IN THE SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A) BEGINNING ON PAGE 27, AND IN NOTE 34 ON PAGE 126.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS,

BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND

COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE

FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED

COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH THESE OTHER FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO THE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED AND THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS,

INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND

PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM

COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY

DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE

FEATURES OF ITS PRODUCTS APPEAL TO CUSTOMERS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FIRM

IS ABLE TO MEET ITS CLIENTS OBJECTIVES OR NEEDS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE

ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER

PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE

IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES HAVE MERGED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED

TO CONTINUE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PROPOSED MERGER OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK

ONE. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING

GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME

EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO COMPETE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

THAT MAY BE LARGER, OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL

PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE

AND FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED

(THE BHCA).

UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA), ENACTED IN 1999, BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES MEETING CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA MAY ELECT TO BECOME FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES, WHICH MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FINANCIAL IN

NATURE, AS WELL AS IN ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) AND THE UNITED STATES

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT) DETERMINE ARE FINANCIAL

IN NATURE OR INCIDENTAL OR COMPLEMENTARY TO FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. UNDER GLBA,

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

INCLUDE INSURANCE, SECURITIES UNDERWRITING AND DEALING, MERCHANT BANKING,

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000.

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, IF ANY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO BE

WELL-CAPITALIZED OR WELL-MANAGED (AS DEFINED BELOW), THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER

FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS

ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY

REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES

OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES. THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

CURRENTLY MEET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND CRA REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA. HOWEVER, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF

FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA

REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY

BY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES (E.G., SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES ARE

REGULATED BY THE SEC, AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE

COMMISSIONERS). THE FIRM MUST CONTINUE TO FILE REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION

WITH, AND SUBMIT TO EXAMINATION BY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AS UMBRELLA

REGULATOR. HOWEVER, UNDER GLBA, WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS AFFECTING FUNCTIONALLY

REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS REQUIRED TO DEFER TO THE

APPLICABLE FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD CONCLUDES

THAT THE ACTIVITIES AT ISSUE POSE A RISK TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR BREACH

A SPECIFIC LAW THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY THE SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE THAT ARE CHARTERED BY A STATE

AND ARE MEMBER BANKS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (A STATE MEMBER BANK) OR

NATIONAL BANKS. NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE

LIMITATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A STATE MEMBER BANK,

SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, OR BY A NATIONAL BANK, SUCH AS CHASE USA, IS

LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A RECENT EARNINGS TEST

AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY

NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR

YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED

NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF

ITS APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR (WHICH, IN THE CASE OF A STATE MEMBER

BANK, IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND, IN THE CASE OF A NATIONAL BANK, IS THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY)).

UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS

TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A

BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK ARE IMPOSED BY NEW YORK LAW. SEE NOTE 25 ON PAGE 114 FOR

THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD, THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (THE FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING

REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS

RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH

HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS

REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO

TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TIER 1

CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL, SEE NOTE 26 ON PAGE 114. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2

CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM

OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL.

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL

CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK AND CERTAIN RISKS ARISING FROM NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES,

AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RISKS, AS IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN

ASSESSING AN INSTITUTIONS OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY. OTHER FACTORS TAKEN INTO

CONSIDERATION BY FEDERAL REGULATORS INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE; LIQUIDITY,

FUNDING AND MARKET RISK; THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS; THE QUALITY OF

LOANS AND INVESTMENTS; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LOAN AND INVESTMENT POLICIES; AND

MANAGEMENTS OVERALL ABILITY TO MONITOR AND CONTROL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL

RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS PRESENTED BY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND

NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES

INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY

ACTIVITIES AND IN THE TRADING OF DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE MARKET

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WITH LARGE TRADING

ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE) TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK IN AN

AMOUNT CALCULATED BY USING THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OWN INTERNAL

VALUE-AT-RISK MODELS (SUBJECT TO PARAMETERS SET BY THE REGULATORS).

THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED SPECIALIZED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIZATIONS AND EQUITY IN NONFINANCIAL

COMPANIES.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO

GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE

TOTAL ASSETS (NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE

ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR STRONG BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

(I.E., THOSE RATED

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPOSITE 1 UNDER THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, PARENT COMPANY,

EARNINGS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY, OR BOPEC, RATING SYSTEM) AND FOR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM

LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS

WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK

PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

TIER 1 COMPONENTS: CAPITAL SURPLUS AND COMMON STOCK REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT

FORMS OF CAPITAL AT JPMORGAN CHASE. BECAUSE COMMON EQUITY HAS NO MATURITY DATE

AND BECAUSE DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ARE PAID ONLY WHEN AND IF DECLARED BY THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMMON EQUITY IS AVAILABLE TO ABSORB LOSSES OVER LONG

PERIODS OF TIME. NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IS SIMILAR TO COMMON

STOCK IN ITS ABILITY TO ABSORB LOSSES. IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DOES NOT

DECLARE A DIVIDEND ON NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IN ANY DIVIDEND

PERIOD, THE HOLDERS OF THE INSTRUMENT ARE NEVER ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THAT

DIVIDEND PAYMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES OUTSTANDING NONCUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK IS

A TYPE COMMONLY REFERENCED AS A FRAP: A FIXED-RATE/ADJUSTABLE PREFERRED

STOCK. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE ON FRAPS MAY INCREASE (UP TO A

PREDETERMINED CEILING), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TREATS THE FIRMS

NONCUMULATIVE FRAPS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

SECURITIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PERMITS CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL BUT ONLY UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS, AS

THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DO NOT PROVIDE AS STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES

AS COMMON EQUITY AND NONCUMULATIVE, NON-FRAP SECURITIES. CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK DOES NOT HAVE A MATURITY DATE, SIMILAR TO OTHER FORMS OF TIER 1

CAPITAL. HOWEVER, ANY DIVIDENDS NOT DECLARED ON CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

ACCUMULATE AND THUS CONTINUE TO BE DUE TO THE HOLDER OF THE INSTRUMENT UNTIL

ALL ARREARAGES ARE SATISFIED. CURRENTLY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO PERMITS TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS.

TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE A TYPE OF SECURITY GENERALLY ISSUED BY A

SPECIAL-PURPOSE TRUST ESTABLISHED AND OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. PROCEEDS FROM

THE ISSUANCE TO THE PUBLIC OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITY ARE LENT TO THE FIRM

FOR AT LEAST 30 (BUT NOT MORE THAN 50) YEARS. THE INTERCOMPANY NOTE THAT

EVIDENCES THIS LOAN PROVIDES THAT THE INTEREST PAYMENTS BY JPMORGAN CHASE ON

THE NOTE MAY BE DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. DURING THE PERIOD OF ANY SUCH

DEFERRAL, NO PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS MAY BE MADE ON ANY OUTSTANDING JPMORGAN

CHASE PREFERRED OR COMMON STOCK OR ON THE OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES ISSUED TO THE PUBLIC. DURING 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (THE FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 46

CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46), WHICH ADDRESSES THE CONSOLIDATION RULES TO

BE APPLIED TO ENTITIES DEFINED IN FIN 46, AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

PRIOR TO FIN 46, TRUSTS THAT ISSUED TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENTS. AS A RESULT OF FIN 46,

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NO LONGER PERMITTED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE TRUSTS. AS A RESULT,

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY CONCLUDE THAT TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY AS TREATMENT AS TIER 1 REGULATORY CAPITAL.

ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HAS ISSUED A SUPERVISORY LETTER INDICATING

THAT TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES WILL CONTINUE AT PRESENT TO BE TREATED AS TIER

1 CAPITAL UNTIL NOTICE IS GIVEN TO THE CONTRARY, SUCH GUIDANCE ALSO INDICATED

THAT THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD MAY PROVIDE FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THIS POINT. THEREFORE, THERE IS

NO CERTAINTY THAT TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AS

TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS OR THAT EXISTING ISSUES WILL BE GRANDFATHERED FOR

SUCH TREATMENT.

TIER 2 COMPONENTS: LONG-TERM SUBORDINATED DEBT (GENERALLY HAVING AN ORIGINAL

MATURITY OF 10-12 YEARS) IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF JPMORGAN CHASES TIER 2

CAPITAL. SUBORDINATED DEBT IS DEEMED A FORM OF REGULATORY CAPITAL BECAUSE

PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT ARE SUBORDINATED TO OTHER CREDITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE,

INCLUDING HOLDERS OF SENIOR AND MEDIUM LONG-TERM DEBT AND COUNTERPARTIES ON

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING

AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING

SUPERVISION. THE BASEL COMMITTEE, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF BANK SUPERVISORS AND

CENTRAL BANKS FROM THE GROUP OF TEN COUNTRIES, ISSUED ITS CAPITAL ACCORD IN

1988 TO ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE IN THE CAPITAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED A

PROPOSED REPLACEMENT FOR THE CAPITAL ACCORD IN JANUARY 2001 AND, SUBSEQUENTLY,

ISSUED A NUMBER OF WORKING PAPERS SUPPLEMENTING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THAT

REPLACEMENT (THE NEW ACCORD). BASED ON THESE DOCUMENTS, THE NEW ACCORD WOULD

ADOPT A THREE-PILLAR FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THESE PILLARS

WOULD INCLUDE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MORE EMPHASIS ON SUPERVISORY

ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND GREATER RELIANCE ON MARKET DISCIPLINE. THE

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEW ACCORD WOULD ALSO INCORPORATE A CAPITAL

CHARGE FOR OPERATIONAL RISK. IN AUGUST 2003, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS

ISSUED AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING (ANPR) ADDRESSING THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ACCORD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ANPR CONTEMPLATES

REQUIRING ALL U.S. BANKING INSTITUTIONS WITH EITHER TOTAL BANKING ASSETS OF AT

LEAST $250 BILLION OR MORE OR TOTAL ON-BALANCE SHEET FOREIGN EXPOSURE OF $10

BILLION OR MORE (CORE BANKS) TO IMPLEMENT THE ADVANCED APPROACHES FOR

MEASURING RISK UNDER THE NEW ACCORD ON A MANDATORY BASIS. AS A CORE BANK,

JPMORGAN CHASE WILL THUS BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED MEASUREMENT

TECHNIQUES EMPLOYING ITS INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO

DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW CAPITAL REGIME,

CORE BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO THEIR

PRIMARY FEDERAL SUPERVISOR THAT THEIR INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET RELEVANT

SUPERVISORY STANDARDS. WHILE THE BASEL SUPERVISORS COMMITTEE HAS TARGETED

DECEMBER 31, 2006 FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ACCORD, THE U.S. REGULATORS

HAVE PROPOSED AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2007 WITH CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991

(FDICIA) PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND

THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY

STANDARDS.

PURSUANT TO FDICIA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE FDIC AND THE COMPTROLLER OF

THE CURRENCY ADOPTED REGULATIONS SETTING FORTH A FIVE-TIER SCHEME FOR MEASURING

THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THEY SUPERVISE. UNDER THE

REGULATIONS (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES), AN

INSTITUTION

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES GENERALLY WILL DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS

CLASSIFICATION WITHIN THE FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES. THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY

TO BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE; HOWEVER,

SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, AS DESCRIBED

BELOW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT

THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO AN

UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY AND

MAY BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON

THAT GUARANTEE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, EACH OF JPMORGAN CHASES BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WAS

WELL-CAPITALIZED.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

FDICIA ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO ESTABLISH A

RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. UNDER THE FDICS

RISK-BASED INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENT SYSTEM, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

ASSIGNED TO ONE OF NINE RISK CLASSIFICATIONS BASED UPON CERTAIN CAPITAL AND

SUPERVISORY MEASURES AND, DEPENDING UPON ITS CLASSIFICATION, IS ASSESSED

INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON ITS DEPOSITS.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS INSURED BY THE BANK INSURANCE FUND ARE REQUIRED TO PAY

PREMIUMS RANGING FROM 0 BASIS POINTS TO 27 BASIS POINTS OF U.S. DEPOSITS. EACH

OF JPMORGAN CHASES BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA,

CURRENTLY QUALIFIES FOR THE 0 BASIS POINT ASSESSMENT. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN

INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT, IF ENACTED, WOULD GIVE THE FDIC DISCRETION TO

IMPOSE DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON ALL DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION,

IF THE RATIO OF INSURED DEPOSITS TO MONEY IN THE BANK INSURANCE FUND DROPS

BELOW SPECIFIED LEVELS, THE FDIC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMPOSE PREMIUMS ON ALL

BANKS INSURED BY THE BANK INSURANCE FUND. ALL DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST ALSO

PAY AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT SO THAT THE FINANCING CORPORATION (FICO) MAY PAY

INTEREST ON BONDS IT ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF SAVINGS

ASSOCIATION INSOLVENCIES OCCURRING PRIOR TO 1991. THE FICO ASSESSMENT FOR THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 IS 1.54 BASIS POINTS OF U.S. DEPOSITS. THE RATE SCHEDULES

ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS BY THE FDIC. IN ADDITION, THE FDIC HAS

AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE SPECIAL

ASSESSMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS ACT.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN

FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED

INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING IN DEFAULT OR

IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY).

DEFAULT IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS THE APPOINTMENT OF A CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER

AND IN DANGER OF DEFAULT IS DEFINED AS CERTAIN CONDITIONS INDICATING THAT A

DEFAULT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR ABSENT REGULATORY ASSISTANCE. AN FDIC

CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST

SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE

POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR

DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY,

THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE

DISAFFIRMANCE OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE

ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE PROVISIONS

WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE OF JPMORGAN CHASES

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK AND CHASE USA, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR

SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS

PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S.

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE

PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION,

INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION

OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC

EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OF ANY

SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK OR CHASE USA, THE PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED

DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE

DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT.

ON OCTOBER 26, 2001, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED INTO LAW THE

USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE ACT).

THE ACT SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENS EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND

THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES, IMPOSES NEW COMPLIANCE

AND DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS, CREATES NEW CRIMES AND PENALTIES, COMPELS THE

PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS LOCATED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING THOSE OF NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CORRESPONDENT RELATIONSHIP

IN THE UNITED STATES, AND CLARIFIES THE SAFE HARBOR FROM CIVIL LIABILITY TO

CUSTOMERS. THE ACT MANDATES THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE A NUMBER OF

REGULATIONS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE ACTS REQUIREMENTS OR PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC

GUIDANCE ON THEIR APPLICATION.

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACT REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS DEFINED, TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. THE ACT REQUIRES

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS FOR NON-U.S.

INSTITUTIONS OR PERSONS OR THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PRIVATE BANKING FOR NON-UNITED

STATES PERSONS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE, SPECIFIC

AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND CONTROLS

THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND REPORT INSTANCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING

THROUGH THOSE ACCOUNTS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES ITS PROGRAMS SATISFY THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY,

JPMORGAN CHASE IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK

SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE

GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES

BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING

PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE

FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

ANY LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE

SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS

OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY,

ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCY

TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK AT A CERTAIN LEVEL WILL BE ASSUMED

BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER

TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES AND ON INVESTMENTS IN

STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS

PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK

SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

THE FIRMS BANK AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (MANY

OF WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK AS A NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK AND A STATE MEMBER BANK, IS SUBJECT TO

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS CHASE USA, ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY EACH OF THE FOREGOING REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERALLY INCLUDE

COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS

BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO

CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES THROUGH

JPMSI AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE

REGULATIONS OF THE SEC AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

JPMSI IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN

CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC. THE TYPES OF

ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY

OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE

TRUTH-IN-LENDING, THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, THE

FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE AND THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACTS, AS WELL

AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING,

ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION OF CONSUMER LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES

THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOANS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS

THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO (1) THE SHARING OF NON-PUBLIC

CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS AND (2) THE

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS

ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION SHARING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH NON-AFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN

GLBA.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FIRM HAS MADE AND WILL MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THESE STATEMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OFTEN USE WORDS SUCH

AS ANTICIPATE, TARGET, EXPECT, ESTIMATE, INTEND, PLAN, GOAL,

BELIEVE OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS GIVE

JPMORGAN CHASES CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS,

CIRCUMSTANCES OR RESULTS. JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING

IN THE MD&A SECTION, CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO MAY

MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN ITS OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC AND

IN OTHER WRITTEN MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ORALLY TO ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, REPRESENTATIVES OF

THE MEDIA AND OTHERS.

ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM SPEAK ONLY AS

OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS

THAT ARISE AFTER THE DATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WAS MADE. THE READER

SHOULD, HOWEVER, CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY MAKE IN ITS ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ITS QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ITS CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. THE FIRMS ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

THOSE SET FORTH IN JPMORGAN CHASES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT

MIGHT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO VARY FROM THAT

DESCRIBED IN ITS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE CREDIT, MARKET,

OPERATIONAL, LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN THE MD&A

SECTION OF THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC. IN

ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH CER-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

TAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES COULD CAUSE ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED RESULTS. HOWEVER, OTHER

FACTORS BESIDES THOSE LISTED BELOW OR DISCUSSED IN JPMORGAN CHASES REPORTS TO

THE SEC ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS, AND THE READER SHOULD

NOT CONSIDER ANY SUCH LIST OF FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES. THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

MERGER OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK ONE.

THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS PROPOSED MERGER WITH BANK ONE. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE MERGER MAY NOT BE CONSUMMATED, OR MAY NOT BE CONSUMMATED BY

MID-2004 AS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, AS A RESULT OF THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN

GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS OF THE MERGER ON THE PROPOSED TERMS OR THE FAILURE OF

EITHER COMPANY TO RECEIVE SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL FOR THE MERGER. IN ADDITION,

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND COST SAVINGS

ANTICIPATED TO BE DERIVED FROM THE MERGER. IF THE FIRM IS NOT ABLE TO COMBINE

SUCCESSFULLY THE BUSINESSES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK ONE, THE ANTICIPATED

BENEFITS FROM THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED FULLY OR AT ALL OR MAY TAKE LONGER

TO REALIZE THAN EXPECTED. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION

PROCESS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, OR THAT THE DISRUPTION OF

ONGOING BUSINESS FROM THE MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS OR SUPPLIERS. FINALLY, UPON

CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, MANAGEMENTS PRESENT EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE

RESULTS OF THE MERGER MAY BE MODIFIED OR REVISED.

BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMY.

THE PROFITABILITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A WORSENING OF GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD. THE DIFFICULT GLOBAL MARKET AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN 2002 IMPROVED MARKEDLY IN 2003. WHILE THE

OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRM FOR 2004 IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, BASED UPON THE GRADUAL

IMPROVEMENT OF THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES

THAT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT BEGAN IN 2003 WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 2004.

FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE LEVEL AND

VOLATILITY OF EQUITY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES, INVESTOR SENTIMENT, INFLATION,

AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ACTIVITY

LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS

AFFECTED BY THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING

AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES, AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS

FROM JPMORGAN CHASES PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A RECURRENCE OF A MARKET

DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN

THE REVENUES IT RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. HIGHER INTEREST

RATES OR CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET ALSO COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF

FINANCIAL INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS

MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING

PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS AT

JPMORGAN PARTNERS. THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF JPMORGAN

CHASES BUSINESS ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASES

CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST

RATES AND IN EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS; AND THE ECONOMIC,

POLITICAL AND BUSINESS

FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT THESE REVENUES WILL

FLUCTUATE OVER TIME.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S.

INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF

THE MUTUAL FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS

REVENUES. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ASSETS MAY BE AFFECTED BY BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IN A POOR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO

JPMORGAN CHASE, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS

AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST RATES, THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LEVEL

OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING, AND THE NUMBER OF

PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AS THESE FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER LOANS

AND CREDIT QUALITY.

COMPETITION.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND

EXPECTS VARIOUS FACTORS TO CAUSE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

INTENSIFY. THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES

LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY

OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES. IN

ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT

POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT

TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO COMPETE

WITH TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PROVIDING ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL

SOLUTIONS.

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS; TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD COMMONLY

KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED

FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL

AND DIPLOMATIC

DEVELOPMENTS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO

NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO INVESTS IN THE SECURITIES OF

CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS.

REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO

NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS. THE IMPACT OF THESE

FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED BECAUSE, GENERALLY, NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES, ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE

VOLATILE THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASE, LIKE ALL LARGE CORPORATIONS, IS EXPOSED TO

MANY TYPES OF OPERATIONAL RISK, INCLUDING THE RISK OF FRAUD BY EMPLOYEES OR

OUTSIDERS, UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS BY EMPLOYEES OR OPERATIONAL ERRORS,

INCLUDING CLERICAL OR RECORD-KEEPING ERRORS OR ERRORS RESULTING FROM FAULTY OR

DISABLED COMPUTER

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS AT

JPMORGAN CHASE, CERTAIN ERRORS MAY BE REPEATED OR COMPOUNDED BEFORE THEY ARE

DISCOVERED AND SUCCESSFULLY RECTIFIED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS NECESSARY

DEPENDENCE UPON AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO RECORD AND PROCESS ITS TRANSACTION VOLUME

MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE RISK THAT TECHNICAL SYSTEM FLAWS OR EMPLOYEE TAMPERING

OR MANIPULATION OF THOSE SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN LOSSES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO

DETECT. THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS,

ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL (INCLUDING,

FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES),

WHICH MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO LOSS OR LIABILITY

TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM IS FURTHER EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT ITS EXTERNAL VENDORS

MAY BE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO THE FIRM (OR WILL BE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK OF FRAUD OR OPERATIONAL ERRORS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE

EMPLOYEES AS IS THE FIRM), AND TO THE RISK THAT ITS (OR ITS VENDORS) BUSINESS

CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADEQUATE. THE

FIRM ALSO FACES THE RISK THAT THE DESIGN OF ITS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES PROVE

INADEQUATE, OR ARE CIRCUMVENTED, THEREBY CAUSING DELAYS IN DETECTION OR ERRORS

IN INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS DESIGNED

TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

JPMORGAN CHASE WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES FROM OPERATIONAL RISKS IN THE FUTURE THAT

MAY BE MATERIAL IN AMOUNT.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND

EARNINGS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL OR OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY

COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND ALSO MAY IMPACT THE

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM. THESE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE COST TO JPMORGAN CHASE

OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING. THE NATURE AND IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND FISCAL POLICIES ARE NOT PREDICTABLE AND ARE

BEYOND JPMORGAN CHASES CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN

IMPACT THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD,

WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON

THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

REPUTATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS

AND EMPLOYEES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS

DAMAGED. THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR TO APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH

VARIOUS ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD CAUSE HARM TO

THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO, APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ETHICAL ISSUES, MONEY-LAUNDERING, PRIVACY,

RECORD-KEEPING, SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES AND THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF

THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN ITS

PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD ALSO GIVE RISE TO

ADDITIONAL LEGAL RISK TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD, IN TURN, INCREASE THE SIZE AND

NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND DAMAGES ASSERTED AGAINST THE FIRM OR SUBJECT THE FIRM TO

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES.

CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASES REVENUES

ALSO ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTENT TO WHICH MANAGEMENT CAN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE

ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES WITHIN A DISCIPLINED RISK ENVIRONMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES

ABILITY TO GROW ITS BUSINESSES IS AFFECTED BY PRICING AND COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, AS WELL AS BY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS. THE ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO UTILIZE THE SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED

METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

EXPENSE DISCIPLINE WILL BE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT TO WHICH

THE FIRM ACHIEVES ITS FINANCIAL TARGETS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE

INSTRUMENTS AND STRATEGIES JPMORGAN CHASE USES TO HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO MARKET, CREDIT AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, THE FIRM

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MITIGATE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURES IN PARTICULAR MARKET

ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST PARTICULAR TYPES OF RISK. JPMORGAN CHASES BALANCE

SHEET GROWTH WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS

WELL AS ON ITS DETERMINATION TO SECURITIZE, SELL, PURCHASE OR SYNDICATE

PARTICULAR LOANS OR LOAN PORTFOLIOS. JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING REVENUES AND

INTEREST RATE RISK ARE DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PROPERLY, AND

MARK TO MARKET, CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY

CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES. THE FIRMSS EARNINGS WILL ALSO BE DEPENDENT

UPON HOW EFFECTIVELY ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE USED IN

ITS PRIVATE EQUITY VALUATIONS, PROVE ACCURATE AND UPON HOW EFFECTIVELY IT

DETERMINES AND ASSESSES THE COST OF CREDIT AND MANAGES ITS RISK CONCENTRATIONS.

TO THE EXTENT ITS ASSESSMENTS OF MIGRATIONS IN CREDIT QUALITY AND OF RISK

CONCENTRATIONS, OR ITS ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES USED IN ESTABLISHING ITS VALUATION

MODELS FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR FOR ITS LOAN LOSS

RESERVES, PROVE INACCURATE OR NOT PREDICTIVE OF ACTUAL RESULTS, THE FIRM COULD

SUFFER HIGHER-THAN-ANTICIPATED LOSSES. THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT,

MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN

MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK, AS EVALUATION BY RATING AGENCIES OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF THESE RISKS AFFECTS THEIR DETERMINATIONS AS TO THE FIRMS CREDIT

RATINGS AND, THEREFORE, ITS COST OF FUNDS.

STORY BUILDING AT ONE CHASE MANHATTAN PLAZA IN NEW YORK CITY. THIS LOCATION HAS

APPROXIMATELY 2 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE, OF

WHICH APPROXIMATELY 700,000 SQUARE FEET IS LEASED TO OUTSIDE TENANTS. JPMORGAN

CHASE ALSO OWNS AND OCCUPIES A 22-STORY BUILDING AT 4 NEW YORK PLAZA, NEW YORK

CITY. THIS LOCATION HAS 900,000 SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL

SPACE, NONE OF WHICH IS LEASED TO OUTSIDE TENANTS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS ALSO A

TENANT IN A NUMBER OF OTHER OFFICE BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE SOLD THE TWO ADJACENT BUILDINGS IT

OWNED AT 23 WALL STREET AND 15 BROAD STREET IN NEW YORK CITY TO A PRIVATE

DEVELOPER. THE TWO BUILDINGS CONTAIN APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF

COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE.

JPMORGAN CHASE BUILT AND FULLY OCCUPIES A TWO-BUILDING COMPLEX KNOWN AS CHASE

METROTECH CENTER IN DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK THAT WAS COMPLETED IN 1992.

THIS FACILITY CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.75 MILLION SQUARE FEET AND HOUSES

OPERATIONS AND PRODUCT SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY LEASES TWO

OFFICE BUILDINGS AT THE NEWPORT OFFICE CENTER IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY,

COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OWN AND OCCUPY ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN HICKSVILLE, NEW YORK; TAMPA, FLORIDA; TEMPE, ARIZONA;

NEWARK, DELAWARE; AND IN HOUSTON, ARLINGTON AND EL PASO, TEXAS.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, JPMORGAN CHASE OCCUPIES, IN THE AGGREGATE, APPROXIMATELY

2.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF LEASED

SPACE IN LONDON ARE 370,000 SQUARE FEET AT 125 LONDON WALL, 325,000 SQUARE FEET

AT ALDERMANBURY, AND A 450,000 SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE COMPLEX AT 60 VICTORIA

EMBANKMENT IN LONDON. JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS AND OCCUPIES A 350,000 SQUARE-FOOT

OPERATIONS CENTER IN BOURNEMOUTH.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY RETAIL

BRANCHES, OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS.

THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF JPMORGAN

CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE INCURRED CHARGES OF $270 MILLION IN 2003 AND $120 MILLION IN

2002 TO COVER THE COSTS OF DISPOSING OF EXCESS SPACE. JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES

TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT

OF ITS PROPOSED MERGER WITH BANK ONE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL

BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF ITS EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL

CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS AND

AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, INCLUDING

STATE PENSION FUNDS, WHO PURCHASED DEBT

SECURITIES ISSUED BY WORLDCOM PURSUANT TO

PUBLIC OFFERINGS IN 1997, 1998, 2000 AND

2001. JPMSI ACTED AS AN UNDERWRITER OF THE

1998, 2000 AND 2001 OFFERINGS AND WAS AN

INITIAL PURCHASER IN THE DECEMBER 2000

PRIVATE BOND OFFERING. IN ADDITION TO

JPMSI, JPMORGAN CHASE AND, IN TWO ACTIONS,

THAT DEFENDANTS EITHER KNEW OR WERE

RECKLESS OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT KNOWING THAT

THE SECURITIES WERE SOLD TO PLAINTIFFS ON

THE BASIS OF MISREPRESENTATIONS AND

OMISSIONS OF MATERIAL FACTS CONCERNING THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF WORLDCOM. THE

AND JPMSL ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND

STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OTHER STATE STATUTES

AND UNDER COMMON LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD AND

NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION.

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LITIGATION.

JPMSI (FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE SECURITIES

INC.) HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN

HIGHER THAN THE OFFERING PRICE AS A

PRECONDITION TO RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS. ON

FEBRUARY 13, 2003, THE COURT DENIED THE

MOTIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHERS TO

DISMISS THE SECURITIES COMPLAINTS. ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2003, THE COURT GRANTED

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE ANTITRUST

CLAIMS RELATING TO THE IPO ALLOCATION

PRACTICES. A SEPARATE ANTITRUST CLAIM

ALLEGING THAT JPMSI AND THE OTHER

UNDERWRITING

FEES IS IN DISCOVERY.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ALSO RECEIVED VARIOUS

SUBPOENAS AND INFORMAL REQUESTS FROM

GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER AGENCIES SEEKING

INFORMATION RELATING TO IPO ALLOCATION

PRACTICES. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2003, JPMSI REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS

(NASD) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE NASD CENSURED JPMSI AND FINED IT $6

MILLION FOR ACTIVITIES IT FOUND TO

CONSTITUTE UNLAWFUL PROFIT SHARING BY

HAMBRECHT & QUIST GROUP IN THE PERIOD

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING ITS

ACQUISITION IN 2000. IN AGREEING TO THE

RESOLUTION OF THE CHARGES, JPMSI NEITHER

ADMITTED NOR DENIED THE NASDS CONTENTIONS.

IN LATE SEPTEMBER JPMSI AND THE SEC AGREED

TO RESOLVE MATTERS RELATING TO THE SECS

INVESTIGATION OF JPMSIS IPO ALLOCATION

PRACTICES DURING 1999 AND 2000. THE SEC

ALLEGED THAT JPMSI VIOLATED RULE 101 OF SEC

REGULATION M IN CERTAIN HOT IPOS BY

ATTEMPTING TO INDUCE CERTAIN CUSTOMERS TO

PLACE AFTERMARKET ORDERS FOR IPO SHARES

BEFORE THE IPO WAS COMPLETED. ALSO, IN THE

CASE OF ONE IPO, THE SEC ALLEGED THAT JPMSI

VIOLATED JUST AND EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES OF

TRADE UNDER NASD CONDUCT RULE 2110 BY

PERSUADING AT LEAST ONE CUSTOMER TO ACCEPT

AN ALLOCATION OF SHARES IN A COLD IPO IN

EXCHANGE FOR A PROMISE OF AN ALLOCATION OF

SHARES IN AN UPCOMING IPO THAT WAS EXPECTED

TO BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. JPMSI NEITHER

ADMITTED NOR DENIED THE SECS ALLEGATIONS,

BUT CONSENTED TO A JUDGMENT (ENTERED

OCTOBER 1, 2003) ENJOINING JPMSI FROM

FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION M AND NASD

CONDUCT RULE 2110 AND REQUIRING JPMSI TO

PAY A CIVIL PENALTY OF $25 MILLION.

STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AND THE

NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS

ASSOCIATION, ON BEHALF OF STATE SECURITIES

REGULATORS, TO RESOLVE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS

OF JPMORGAN CHASE RELATING TO RESEARCH

ANALYST INDEPENDENCE. PURSUANT TO THE

AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE, WITHOUT

ADMITTING OR DENYING THE ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING ALLEGED CONFLICTS,

AGREED, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) TO PAY $50

MILLION FOR RETROSPECTIVE RELIEF, (II) TO

ADOPT INTERNAL STRUCTURAL AND OPERATIONAL

REFORMS THAT WILL FURTHER AUGMENT THE STEPS

IT HAS ALREADY TAKEN TO ENSURE THE

INTEGRITY OF JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYST

RESEARCH, (III) TO CONTRIBUTE $25 MILLION

SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS TO PROVIDE

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH TO CLIENTS

AND (IV) TO CONTRIBUTE $5 MILLION TOWARDS

INVESTOR EDUCATION. MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY

SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED

AND APPROVED BY THE SEC, THE NYSE, THE NASD

AND THE TEXAS STATE SECURITIES BOARD.

MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS

HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND APPROVED BY THE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN ALL BUT A FEW

STATES, AND SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE

PROCESS OF BEING NEGOTIATED WITH THE

REMAINING STATES. ON OCTOBER 31, 2003, THE

COURT ENTERED FINAL JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO

THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC.

JPMSI HAS BEEN NAMED AS A CO-DEFENDANT WITH

NINE OTHER BROKER-DEALERS IN TWO ACTIONS

INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE AT

ISSUE IN THE REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS: A

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION FILED

IN FEDERAL

COURT IN COLORADO SEEKING AN UNSPECIFIED

AMOUNT OF MONEY DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AND AN ACTION

FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT BY WEST

VIRGINIAS ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING

RECOVERY FROM THE DEFENDANTS IN THE

AGGREGATE OF $5,000 FOR EACH OF WHAT ARE

ALLEGED TO BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

VIOLATIONS OF THE STATES CONSUMER

PROTECTION STATUTE. ON AUGUST 8, 2003, THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE COLORADO ACTION DISMISSED

THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. MOTIONS TO

DISMISS THE WEST VIRGINIA ACTION AND TO

DISQUALIFY PRIVATE COUNSEL RETAINED BY THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROSECUTE THAT ACTION

ARE PENDING.

JPMSI WAS SERVED BY THE SEC, NASD AND NYSE

ON OR ABOUT MAY

30, 2003, WITH SUBPOENAS OR DOCUMENT

REQUESTS SEEKING INFORMATION REGARDING

CERTAIN PRESENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND

EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH A FOLLOW-UP TO

THE REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, THIS TIME

FOCUSING ON WHETHER PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS

PROPERLY PERFORMED SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS

REGARDING DOMESTIC EQUITY RESEARCH. THE

FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THE

INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH CONTINUE.

LITIGATION RESERVE AND OTHER.

DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE FIRM

ESTABLISHED A RESERVE OF $900 MILLION

RELATED TO COSTS ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED

IN CONNECTION WITH THE VARIOUS PRIVATE

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES

INVOLVING ENRON AND THE OTHER MATERIAL

LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE FIRM ADDED $100

MILLION TO THE RESERVE RELATED TO ENRON. OF

THE $1 BILLION, $700 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED

TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ENRON. THE

BALANCE OF $300 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO

THE VARIOUS LITIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS DEBT

AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES AND

EQUITY RESEARCH PRACTICES. THE RESERVE MAY

BE REVISED IN THE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003, THE ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION

RESERVE WAS $524 MILLION, AND THE BALANCE

OF THE $300 MILLION SET ASIDE AT DECEMBER

31, 2002 WAS $221 MILLION.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES,

PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS FOR WHICH

THE RESERVE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE

BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN

VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY

LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR WHERE THE

CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OR

INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES, THE FIRM

CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE

EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE PENDING MATTERS

(INCLUDING THE PENDING MATTERS AS TO WHICH

THE RESERVE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED) WILL BE,

WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION

OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE

EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES OR PENALTIES RELATED

TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. SUBJECT TO

THE FOREGOING CAVEAT, JPMORGAN CHASE

ANTICIPATES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL

AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS

LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF

THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT

SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

THE FIRM, ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR PROCEEDING OR THE IMPOSITION OF

A PARTICULAR FINE OR PENALTY MAY BE

MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING

RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING

UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE

LOSS OR LIABILITY AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN

CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

IN 2003, GLOBAL GROWTH STRENGTHENED

RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR TWO YEARS. THE U.S.

ECONOMY IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, SUPPORTED

BY DIMINISHING GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES,

NEW TAX RELIEF, STRONG PROFIT GROWTH, LOW

INTEREST RATES AND A RISING STOCK MARKET.

PRODUCTIVITY AT U.S. BUSINESSES CONTINUED

TO GROW AT AN EXTRAORDINARY PACE, AS A

RESULT OF ONGOING INVESTMENT IN

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. PROFIT MARGINS

ROSE TO LEVELS NOT SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

NEW HIRING REMAINED TEPID, BUT SIGNS OF AN

IMPROVING JOB MARKET EMERGED LATE IN THE

YEAR. INFLATION FELL TO THE LOWEST LEVEL

IN MORE THAN 40 YEARS, AND THE BOARD OF

GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

(THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) DECLARED

THAT ITS LONG-RUN GOAL OF PRICE STABILITY

HAD BEEN ACHIEVED.

AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, J.P. MORGAN CHASE &

CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM)

REPORTED 2003 NET INCOME OF $6.7 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION

IN 2002. ALL FIVE OF THE FIRMS LINES

OF BUSINESS BENEFITED FROM THE IMPROVED

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WITH EACH REPORTING

INCREASED REVENUE OVER 2002. IN

PARTICULAR, THE LOWINTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT DROVE ROBUST FIXED INCOME

MARKETS AND AN UNPRECEDENTED MORTGAGE

REFINANCING BOOM, RESULTING IN RECORD

EARNINGS IN THE INVESTMENT BANK AND CHASE

FINANCIAL SERVICES.

TOTAL REVENUE FOR 2003 WAS $33.3

BILLION, UP 12% FROM 2002. THE

INVESTMENT BANKS REVENUE INCREASED BY

APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION FROM 2002,

AND CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE

WAS $14.6 BILLION IN 2003, ANOTHER

RECORD YEAR.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.7

BILLION, DOWN 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IN

2002, THE FIRM RECORDED $1.3 BILLION OF

CHARGES, PRINCIPALLY FOR ENRON-RELATED

SURETY LITIGATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

LITIGATION RESERVES; AND $1.2 BILLION FOR

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO

PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2002. EXCLUDING THESE COSTS, EXPENSES ROSE

BY 7% IN 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES; INCREASED

COSTS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AND PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EXPENSES; AND HIGHER OCCUPANCY EXPENSES. THE FIRM BEGAN EXPENSING

STOCK OPTIONS IN 2003. RESTRUCTURING COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED

AFTER JANUARY 1, 2002, WERE RECORDED IN

THEIR RELEVANT EXPENSE CATEGORIES AND

TOTALED $630 MILLION IN 2003, DOWN 29%

FROM 2002.

THE 2003 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF

$1.5 BILLION WAS DOWN $2.8 BILLION, OR

64%, FROM 2002. THE PROVISION WAS LOWER

THAN TOTAL NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $2.3

BILLION, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT

IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO. COMMERCIAL

NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND CRITICIZED

EXPOSURE LEVELS DECLINED 42% AND 47%,

RESPECTIVELY, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STABLE.

EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (EPS) FOR

THE YEAR WERE $3.24, AN INCREASE OF 305%

OVER THE EPS OF $0.80 REPORTED IN 2002.

RESULTS IN 2002 WERE PROVIDED ON BOTH A

REPORTED BASIS AND AN OPERATING BASIS,

WHICH EXCLUDED MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING

COSTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS. OPERATING EPS IN

2002 WAS $1.66. SEE PAGE 28 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR A RECONCILIATION

BETWEEN REPORTED AND OPERATING EPS.

THE TABLE ABOVE SHOWS JPMORGAN CHASES

SEGMENT RESULTS. THESE RESULTS REFLECT THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY

MANAGEMENT AND IS PRESENTED ON AN

OPERATING BASIS. PRIOR-PERIOD SEGMENT

RESULTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT

ALIGNMENT OF MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES OR CHANGES IN ORGANIZATIONAL

STRUCTURE AMONG BUSINESSES.

IB

REPORTED RECORD EARNINGS OF $3.7

BILLION FOR 2003, UP 183% FROM 2002,

DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN CAPITAL MARKETS

REVENUES AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES,

COUPLED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

CREDIT COSTS. THE LOWINTEREST-RATE

ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVEMENT IN EQUITY MARKETS

AND VOLATILITY IN CREDIT MARKETS PRODUCED

INCREASED CLIENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

REVENUE IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES, AS

WELL AS STRONG RETURNS IN GLOBAL TREASURY.

MARKET-SHARE GAINS IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING

CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES OVER 2002. IBS RETURN ON

ALLOCATED CAPITAL WAS 19% FOR THE YEAR.

TSS

EARNINGS OF $520 MILLION FOR THE YEAR

WERE DOWN 16% COMPARED WITH 2002. REVENUES

WERE $4.0 BILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR, UP 3%

FROM 2002. INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES

AND TREASURY SERVICES POSTED SINGLE-DIGIT

REVENUE GROWTH. INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE

DECLINED YEAR-OVER-YEAR BUT SHOWED AN

IMPROVING TREND OVER THE LAST FOUR

CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS. RETURN ON ALLOCATED

CAPITAL FOR TSS WAS 19% FOR THE YEAR.

IMPB

INCREASED EARNINGS AND ASSETS UNDER

SUPERVISION IN 2003. EARNINGS OF $268

MILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR WERE UP 3% FROM

2002, REFLECTING AN IMPROVED CREDIT

PORTFOLIO, SLIGHTLY HIGHER REVENUES AND

THE BENEFITS OF MANAGED EXPENSE GROWTH.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUES REFLECTED THE

ACQUISITION OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES,

AND INCREASED AVERAGE EQUITY MARKET

VALUATIONS IN CLIENT PORTFOLIOS AND

BROKERAGE ACTIVITY, MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE

IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL NET OUTFLOWS.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN CORE

INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS IMPROVED, WITH ALL

MAJOR ASSET CLASSES IN U.S. INSTITUTIONAL

FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES SHOWING

ABOVE-BENCHMARK RESULTS. RETURN ON

ALLOCATED CAPITAL WAS 5% FOR THE YEAR;

RETURN ON TANGIBLE ALLOCATED CAPITAL WAS

20%.

JPMP

PERFORMANCE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY,

WITH PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS OF $27

MILLION, COMPARED WITH PRIVATE EQUITY

LOSSES OF $733 MILLION FOR 2002. RESULTS

FOR THE DIRECT INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO

IMPROVED BY $929 MILLION FROM 2002,

DRIVEN BY REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND

DECLINING WRITE-DOWNS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003.

JPMP REVENUE

WAS IMPACTED

IN 2003 BY LOSSES ON SALES AND WRITEDOWNS

OF PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY FUND

INVESTMENTS. JPMP DECREASED ITS OPERATING

LOSS FOR THE YEAR BY 64% COMPARED WITH

2002.

CFS

POSTED RECORD EARNINGS OF $2.5

BILLION, DRIVEN BY RECORD RESULTS AND

ORIGINATION VOLUMES AT EACH OF THE

NATIONAL CREDIT BUSINESSES MORTGAGE,

CREDIT CARD AND AUTO. RECORD REVENUES FOR

CFS OF $14.6 BILLION WERE UP 9% FROM 2002,

DRIVEN BY RECORD REVENUES IN CHASE HOME

FINANCE. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT DEPOSIT

GROWTH, CHASE REGIONAL BANKING REVENUES

DECREASED DUE TO DEPOSIT SPREAD

COMPRESSION. CFSS RETURN ON ALLOCATED

CAPITAL WAS 28% FOR THE YEAR.

IN 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE REVISED ITS

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING POLICIES TO

ALLOCATE CERTAIN REVENUES, EXPENSES AND

TAX-RELATED ITEMS THAT HAD BEEN RECORDED

WITHIN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT TO THE OTHER

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON

THE FIRMS OVERALL EARNINGS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS SEGMENT

RESULTS, SEE PAGES 2744 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE INCREASED CAPITAL DURING

2003. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FIRMS

TIER 1 CAPITAL WAS $43.2 BILLION, $5.6

BILLION HIGHER THAN AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5% WAS WELL

IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM REGULATORY

GUIDELINES, IT WAS 8.2% AT YEAR-END 2002.

THE FIRM MAINTAINED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

OF $0.34 PER SHARE ON ITS COMMON STOCK.

JPMORGAN CHASE DID NOT REPURCHASE SHARES

OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN 2003. MANAGEMENT

EXPECTS TO RECOMMEND TO THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS THAT THE FIRM RESUME ITS SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM AFTER THE COMPLETION OF

THE PENDING MERGER WITH BANK ONE

CORPORATION (SEE BUSINESS EVENTS BELOW).

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS

DESIGNED TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY

RESOURCES TO MEET ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS,

BOTH ON- AND OFFBALANCE SHEET, IN A WIDE

RANGE OF MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. THE FIRMS

ACCESS TO THE UNSECURED FUNDING MARKETS

IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS CREDIT RATING.

DURING 2003, THE FIRM MAINTAINED SENIOR

DEBT RATINGS OF AA-/AA3/A+ AT JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK AND A+/A1/A+ AT THE PARENT

HOLDING COMPANY. UPON THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF

THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH BANK ONE

CORPORATION, MOODYS AND FITCH PLACED THE

FIRMS RATINGS ON REVIEW FOR AN

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

UPGRADE, AND S&P AFFIRMED ALL OF THE

FIRMS RATINGS. SEE BUSINESS EVENTS

BELOW.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN

LOWERING ITS RISK PROFILE IN 2003.

TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE, WHICH

INCLUDES LOANS, DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES,

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND OTHER

ASSETS, DECLINED BY $30.2 BILLION, OR 7%,

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002. INCREASED

FINANCINGS IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS, REDUCED

LOAN DEMAND AND LOAN SALES DROVE THE

DECLINE. IN 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A

MORE STRINGENT EXPOSURE-REVIEW PROCESS AND

LOWER ABSOLUTE EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR

INDUSTRY AND SINGLE-NAME CONCENTRATIONS,

INCLUDING INVESTMENT-GRADE OBLIGORS. THE

FIRM WAS ALSO MORE ACTIVE IN MANAGING

COMMERCIAL CREDIT BY SELLING HIGHER-RISK

LOANS AND COMMITMENTS AND ENTERING INTO

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP HEDGES.

TOTAL CONSUMER LOANS ON A MANAGED BASIS,

WHICH INCLUDES BOTH REPORTED AND

SECURITIZED LOANS, INCREASED BY $15.7

BILLION, OR 10%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS PREDOMINANTLY

U.S.-BASED. THE LARGEST COMPONENT, 14

FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH

ARE PRIMARILY SECURED BY FIRST MORTGAGES,

COMPRISED 43% OF THE TOTAL CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

JPMPS PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO DECLINED

BY 12% TO $7.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, FROM $8.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. AT YEAR-END 2003, THE PORTFOLIO WAS

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRY SECTORS AND

GEOGRAPHIES  WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE

INVESTED IN MORE MATURE LEVERAGED BUYOUTS

AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE IN VENTURE

INVESTMENTS THAN AT YEAR-END 2002. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF JPMPS PORTFOLIO HAS

DECREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR, CONSISTENT WITH

MANAGEMENTS GOAL TO REDUCE, OVER TIME,

THE CAPITAL COMMITTED TO PRIVATE EQUITY.

THE FIRM USES SEVERAL TOOLS, BOTH

STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, TO MEASURE

MARKET RISK, INCLUDING VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR), RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE

EXPOSURES (RIFLE), ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS

TESTS AND NET INTEREST INCOME STRESS

TESTS. THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR DAILY ON

ITS TRADING AND NONTRADING ACTIVITIES.

AVERAGE TRADING VAR DECREASED FOR

FULL-YEAR 2003. THE YEAR-END TRADING VAR

INCREASED COMPARED WITH YEAR-END 2002 DUE

TO HIGHER VAR FOR EQUITY ACTIVITIES. IN

2003, TRADING LOSSES EXCEEDED VAR ON ONLY

ONE DAY, A RESULT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH

THE 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, AND DECEMBER 31

NONTRADING VAR INCREASED IN 2003,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN MARKET

VOLATILITY DURING THE 2003 THIRD QUARTER

AND TO THE RISE IN INTEREST RATES IN THE

SECOND HALF OF 2003. THERE WAS AN

ADDITIONAL DAY IN 2003 IN WHICH LOSSES

EXCEEDED VAR; THIS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CERTAIN POSITIONS IN THE MORTGAGE BANKING

BUSINESS.

THE FIRM IS ALSO COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING

BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

THE FIDUCIARY RISK COMMITTEE IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THAT BUSINESSES

PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PERFORM AT THE

APPROPRIATE STANDARD IN THEIR

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS. IN ADDITION,

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE OVERSEES THE

REVIEW OF TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS IN

TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL ISSUES

AND REPUTATION RISK, WITH

THE GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE

NOT USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR

OTHERS.

DURING THE YEAR, THE FIRM REVISED ITS

CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES FOR

CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, BUSINESS AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK. THIS RESULTED IN THE

REALLOCATION OF CAPITAL AMONG THE RISK

CATEGORIES AND THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS; THE

REALLOCATION DID NOT RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL

CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AS A WHOLE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISK

MANAGEMENT AND THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION

METHODOLOGY, SEE PAGES 45-74 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND FINANCIAL

MARKETS ACTIVITY ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE

TO IMPROVE IN 2004. WHILE RISING INTEREST

RATES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MORTGAGE

AND GLOBAL TREASURY BUSINESSES; ON THE

POSITIVE SIDE, GAINS IN MARKET SHARE,

RISING EQUITY VALUES AND INCREASED MARKET

ACTIVITY MAY BENEFIT MANY OF THE FIRMS

OTHER BUSINESSES.

THE FIRM EXPECTS TO SEE A DIFFERENT MIX OF

EARNINGS IN 2004. IB IS TARGETING HIGHER

ISSUER AND INVESTOR CLIENT REVENUE, BUT

SECURITIES GAINS AND NET INTEREST INCOME

MAY BE LOWER. MORTGAGE EARNINGS ARE LIKELY

TO DECLINE FROM THE RECORD SET IN 2003,

AND GROWTH IN OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES MAY

NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE DECLINE IN

MORTGAGE REVENUE. IMPROVED EQUITY MARKETS

AND INCREASED M&A ACTIVITY MAY PROVIDE

INCREASED EXIT OPPORTUNITIES IN PRIVATE

EQUITY AND COULD RESULT IN HIGHER FEES IN

IMPB AND IN THE CUSTODY BUSINESS OF TSS.

COMMERCIAL NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS MAY BE

LOWER, BUT CREDIT COSTS MAY RISE AS THE

REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES SLOWS. THE FIRM EXPECTS STABLE

CONSUMER NET CHARGE-OFF RATIOS IN 2004.

BUSINESS EVENTS

AGREEMENT TO MERGE WITH BANK ONE CORPORATION

ON JANUARY 14, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE AND

BANK ONE CORPORATION (BANK ONE)

ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO MERGE. THE

MERGER AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED

BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF BOTH

COMPANIES, PROVIDES FOR A STOCK-FOR-STOCK

MERGER IN WHICH 1.32 SHARES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE COMMON STOCK WILL BE EXCHANGED, ON A

TAX-FREE BASIS, FOR EACH SHARE OF BANK ONE

COMMON STOCK.

THE MERGED COMPANY, HEADQUARTERED IN NEW

YORK, WILL BE KNOWN AS J.P. MORGAN CHASE &

CO. AND WILL HAVE COMBINED ASSETS OF $1.1

TRILLION, A STRONG CAPITAL BASE, 2,300

BRANCHES IN 17 STATES AND TOP-TIER

POSITIONS IN RETAIL BANKING AND LENDING,

CREDIT CARDS, INVESTMENT BANKING, ASSET

MANAGEMENT, PRIVATE BANKING, TREASURY AND

SECURITIES SERVICES, MIDDLE MARKETS AND

PRIVATE EQUITY. IT IS EXPECTED THAT COST

SAVINGS OF $2.2 BILLION (PRE-TAX) WILL BE

ACHIEVED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

MERGER-RELATED COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE $3

BILLION (PRE-TAX).

THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE

SHAREHOLDERS OF BOTH INSTITUTIONS AS WELL

AS U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S.

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IT IS EXPECTED TO

BE COMPLETED IN MID-2004.

TRADING REVENUE

TRADING REVENUE IN 2003 OF $4.4 BILLION

WAS UP 65% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITIES DROVE GROWTH IN BOTH CLIENT AND

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REVENUES. PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT, IN PARTICULAR, WAS UP

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 2002 AS A RESULT OF

GAINS IN CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

EQUITY DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES. TRADING

REVENUE, ON A REPORTED BASIS, EXCLUDES THE

IMPACT OF NET INTEREST INCOME (NII)

RELATED TO IBS TRADING ACTIVITIES, WHICH

IS REPORTED IN NII. HOWEVER, THE FIRM

INCLUDES TRADING-RELATED NII AS PART OF

TRADING REVENUE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING

PURPOSES TO BETTER ASSESS THE

PROFITABILITY OF IBS TRADING BUSINESS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TRADING

REVENUE, SEE IB SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON

PAGES 2931 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEES AND COMMISSIONS

FEES AND COMMISSIONS OF $10.7 BILLION IN

2003 ROSE 3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS A

RESULT OF HIGHER CREDIT CARD SERVICING

FEES ASSOCIATED WITH $5.8 BILLION IN

GROWTH IN AVERAGE SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

INCREASE FROM 2002 WERE HIGHER CUSTODY,

INSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND OTHER

PROCESSING-RELATED SERVICE FEES. THESE

FEES REFLECTED THE MORE FAVORABLE

ENVIRONMENT FOR DEBT AND EQUITY

ACTIVITIES. FOR A TABLE

SHOWING THE COMPONENTS OF FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 8889

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS

SERVICE FEES, IMPB FOR INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE FEES, AND CFS FOR

CONSUMER-RELATED FEES ON PAGES 3233,

3435 AND 3843, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS (LOSSES)

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS OF $33 MILLION IN

2003 REFLECT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM

LOSSES OF $746 MILLION IN 2002. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS

(LOSSES), WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN

JPMP, SEE JPMP RESULTS ON PAGES 3637.

SECURITIES GAINS

IN 2003, SECURITIES GAINS OF $1.4 BILLION

DECLINED 7% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

DECLINE REFLECTED LOWER GAINS REALIZED

FROM THE SALE OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY

SECURITIES IN IB AND MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES IN CHASE HOME FINANCE (CHF),

DRIVEN BY THE INCREASING INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2003. IB USES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MANAGE, IN PART,

THE ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES OF THE FIRM;

CHF USES THESE INSTRUMENTS TO ECONOMICALLY

HEDGE THE VALUE OF MORTGAGE SERVICING

RIGHTS (MSRS). FOR A FURTHER ANALYSIS OF

SECURITIES GAINS, SEE IB AND CHF ON PAGES

2931 AND 3940, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME OF $892

MILLION IN 2003 DECLINED 10% FROM 2002.

THE DECLINE REFLECTS LOWER MORTGAGE

SERVICING FEES AND LOWER REVENUES FROM MSR

HEDGING ACTIVITIES; THESE WERE OFFSET BY

HIGHER FEES FROM ORIGINATION AND SALES

ACTIVITY AND OTHER FEES DERIVED FROM

VOLUME AND MARKET-SHARE GROWTH. MORTGAGE

FEES AND RELATED INCOME, ON A REPORTED

BASIS, EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NII AND

SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO

CHASE HOME FINANCES MORTGAGE BANKING

ACTIVITIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

MORTGAGE-RELATED REVENUE, SEE THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION FOR CHASE HOME FINANCE ON PAGES

3940 AND NOTE 4 ON PAGE 89 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

OTHER REVENUE

OTHER REVENUE OF $579 MILLION IN 2003 ROSE

26% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS

A RESULT OF $200 MILLION IN GAINS FROM THE

SALE OF SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN LOAN

SATISFACTIONS (COMPARED WITH $26 MILLION

IN 2002), PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET

RESULTS FROM CORPORATE AND BANK-OWNED LIFE

INSURANCE POLICIES. MANY OTHER FACTORS

CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHANGE FROM 2002,

INCLUDING $73 MILLION OF WRITE-DOWNS TAKEN

IN 2002 FOR SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN

INVESTMENTS.

NET INTEREST INCOME

NII OF $12.3 BILLION WAS 7% HIGHER THAN

IN 2002. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE

POSITIVE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES

ON CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND

RELATED FUNDING COSTS. AVERAGE MORTGAGE

LOANS IN CHF ROSE 32% TO $74.1 BILLION, AND

AVERAGE AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND LEASES IN CHASE AUTO FINANCE

INCREASED 32% TO

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

$41.7 BILLION. NII WAS

LOANS AND LOWER SPREADS ON INVESTMENT

SECURITIES. AS A COMPONENT OF NII,

TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME OF

$2.1 BILLION WAS UP 13% FROM 2002 DUE TO A

THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING

COMPENSATION EXPENSE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2003 WAS 6% HIGHER

THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES, AND HIGHER

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

COSTS, PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

COSTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES 8993 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE INCREASE PERTAINING TO

INCENTIVES INCLUDED $266 MILLION AS A

RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 123, AND $120

MILLION FROM THE REVERSAL IN 2002 OF

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES FOR CERTAIN

FORFEITABLE KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS, AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 ON PAGES 9395 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE

DECLINED AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSFER,

BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2003, OF 2,800

EMPLOYEES TO IBM IN CONNECTION WITH A

TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL-TIME

EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS 93,453 COMPARED WITH

94,335 AT THE PRIOR YEAR-END.

OCCUPANCY EXPENSE

OCCUPANCY EXPENSE OF $1.9 BILLION ROSE 19%

FROM 2002. THE INCREASE REFLECTED COSTS OF

ADDITIONAL LEASED SPACE IN MIDTOWN

MANHATTAN AND IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST

REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES; HIGHER REAL

ESTATE TAXES IN NEW YORK CITY; AND THE

COST OF ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE CHARGES

FOR UNOCCUPIED EXCESS REAL ESTATE OF $270

MILLION; THIS COMPARED WITH $120 MILLION

IN 2002, MOSTLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

THAT YEAR.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE

IN 2003, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS

EXPENSE WAS 11% ABOVE THE PRIOR-YEAR

LEVEL. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

SHIFT IN EXPENSES: COSTS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH COMPENSATION

AND OTHER EXPENSES SHIFTED, UPON THE

COMMENCEMENT OF THE IBM OUTSOURCING

AGREEMENT, TO TECHNOLOGY AND

COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE INCREASE WERE HIGHER COSTS RELATED

TO SOFTWARE AMORTIZATION. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE IBM OUTSOURCING

AGREEMENT, SEE SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE

ON PAGE 44 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER EXPENSE

OTHER EXPENSE IN 2003 ROSE SLIGHTLY FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER OUTSIDE

SERVICES. FOR A TABLE SHOWING THE

COMPONENTS OF OTHER EXPENSE, SEE NOTE 8

ON PAGE 96 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SURETY SETTLEMENT AND LITIGATION RESERVE

THE FIRM ADDED $100 MILLION TO THE

ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION RESERVE IN 2003

TO SUPPLEMENT A $900 MILLION RESERVE

INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2002. THE 2002

RESERVE WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER

ENRON-RELATED MATTERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN

OTHER MATERIAL LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS

INVOLVED. IN ADDITION, IN 2002 THE FIRM

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $400 MILLION FOR THE

SETTLEMENT OF ENRON-RELATED SURETY

LITIGATION.

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO

BUSINESS RESTRUCTURINGS ANNOUNCED AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2002, WERE RECORDED IN THEIR

RELEVANT EXPENSE CATEGORIES. IN 2002,

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $1.2

BILLION, FOR PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED PRIOR TO

JANUARY 1, 2002, WERE VIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT AS NONOPERATING EXPENSES OR

SPECIAL ITEMS. REFER TO NOTE 8 ON PAGES 9596 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND FOR A

SUMMARY, BY EXPENSE CATEGORY AND BUSINESS

SEGMENT, OF COSTS INCURRED IN 2003 AND

2002 FOR PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED AFTER JANUARY

1, 2002.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE 2003 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$2.8 BILLION LOWER THAN IN 2002, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

QUALITY OF THE COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO

AND A HIGHER VOLUME OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND

THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, SEE

THE DISCUSSIONS OF NET CHARGE-OFFS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL AND

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ON PAGES 6365 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $3.3 BILLION IN

2003, COMPARED WITH $856 MILLION IN 2002.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2003 WAS 33%,

COMPARED WITH 34% IN 2002. THE TAX RATE

DECLINE WAS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME

SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT RESULTS

JPMORGAN CHASES LINES OF BUSINESS ARE

SEGMENTED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER

SERVICED AND REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATED BY THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT.

REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED

WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN

DETERMINING THAT SEGMENTS RESULTS.

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AND OTHER POLICIES

EXIST TO ALLOCATE THOSE REMAINING EXPENSES

THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY INCURRED BY THE

SEGMENTS.

OVERVIEW

THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

ARE KNOWN GLOBALLY AS JPMORGAN AND

COMPRISE THE INVESTMENT BANK, TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

& PRIVATE BANKING AND JPMORGAN PARTNERS.

THE NATIONAL CONSUMER AND MIDDLE MARKET

BUSINESSES ARE KNOWN AS CHASE AND

COLLECTIVELY COMPRISE CHASE FINANCIAL

SERVICES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH APPEAR ON

PAGES 8285 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, USING

U.S. GAAP AND PREVAILING INDUSTRY

PRACTICES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

PRESENTED ON A REPORTED BASIS, WHICH

PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING

OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE

CONSISTENTLY TRACKED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND

ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS

PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S.

GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS

RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT

LOOKS AT RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS,

WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO

ASSESS EACH OF ITS LINES OF BUSINESS AND

TO MEASURE OVERALL FIRM RESULTS AGAINST

TARGETED GOALS. THE DEFINITION OF

OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED

U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND THEN EXCLUDES THE

IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS.

SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE JPMORGAN

CHASES REPORTED VERSUS OPERATING NET

INCOME; HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE

CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, SEE CHASE CARDMEMBER

SERVICES ON PAGE 41 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIOR TO 2003, THE FIRM EXCLUDED FROM ITS

OPERATING RESULTS THE IMPACT OF MERGER AND

RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS, AS

THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE VIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT AS NOT PART OF THE FIRMS

NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR

UNUSUAL IN NATURE AND, THEREFORE, NOT

INDICATIVE OF TRENDS. TO BE CONSIDERED A

SPECIAL ITEM, THE NONRECURRING GAIN OR

LOSS HAD TO BE AT LEAST $75 MILLION OR

MORE DURING 2002. COMMENCING IN 2003,

MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT MANY OF THE

COSTS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED NONOPERATING

WERE TO BE DEEMED OPERATING COSTS.

HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE

FUTURE, MANAGEMENT MAY DESIGNATE CERTAIN

MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES INCURRED BY THE

FIRM TO BE SPECIAL ITEMS.

THE SEGMENT RESULTS ALSO REFLECT

REVENUE- AND EXPENSE-SHARING AGREEMENTS

BETWEEN CERTAIN LINES OF BUSINESS.

REVENUE AND EXPENSES ATTRIBUTED TO

SHARED ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EACH

LINE OF BUSINESS, AND ANY DOUBLE

COUNTING IS ELIMINATED AT THE SEGMENT

LEVEL. THESE ARRANGEMENTS PROMOTE

CROSS-SELLING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHARED

CLIENT EXPENSES. THEY ALSO ENSURE THAT

THE CONTRIBUTIONS

OF BOTH BUSINESSES ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED.

PRIOR-PERIOD SEGMENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ALIGNMENT OF

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CHANGES

IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AMONG

BUSINESSES. RESTATEMENTS OF SEGMENT

RESULTS MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

SEE NOTE 34 ON PAGES 126-127 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ABOUT JPMORGAN CHASES FIVE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

THE FIRM ALLOCATES CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESS

UNITS UTILIZING A RISK-ADJUSTED

METHODOLOGY, WHICH QUANTIFIES CREDIT,

MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISKS

WITHIN EACH BUSINESS AND ADDITIONALLY, FOR

JPMP, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THOSE RISKS, SEE THE RISK

MANAGEMENT SECTIONS ON PAGES 4574 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE FIRM ALLOCATES

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESSES

INCORPORATING AN ASSET CAPITAL TAX ON

MANAGED ASSETS AND SOME OFFBALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION, BUSINESSES ARE

ALLOCATED CAPITAL EQUAL TO 100% OF

GOODWILL AND 50% FOR CERTAIN

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

THE FIRM USES THE SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED

(SVA) FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE THE

PERFORMANCE OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. TO

DERIVE SVA, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE,

FOR ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, THE FIRM

APPLIES A 12% (AFTER-TAX) COST OF CAPITAL

TO EACH SEGMENT, EXCEPT JPMP  THIS

BUSINESS IS CHARGED A 15% (AFTER-TAX) COST

OF CAPITAL. THE CAPITAL ELEMENTS AND

RESULTANT CAPITAL CHARGES PROVIDE EACH

BUSINESS WITH THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK TO

EVALUATE THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN USING

CAPITAL VERSUS ITS RETURN TO SHAREHOLD-

ERS. CAPITAL CHARGES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART

OF THE SVA MEASUREMENT FOR EACH BUSINESS.

UNDER THE FIRMS MODEL, ECONOMIC CAPITAL

IS EITHER UNDERALLOCATED OR OVERALLOCATED

TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AS COMPARED WITH

THE FIRMS TOTAL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY. THE REVENUE AND SVA IMPACT OF THIS OVER/UNDER

ALLOCATION IS REPORTED UNDER SUPPORT UNITS

AND CORPORATE. SEE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON

PAGE 131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A

DEFINITION OF SVA AND PAGE 44 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE DETAILS.

6% THE RESULT OF TIGHTENING OF CREDIT

SPREADS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, AS

WELL AS LOWER NII, WHICH REFLECTED LOWER

LEVELS OF COMMERCIAL LOANS. EQUITIES

REVENUE OF $1.5 BILLION WAS UP 51% FROM

LAST YEAR DUE TO HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY

AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN

DERIVATIVES AND CONVERTIBLES.

OPERATING EXPENSE

INCREASED 6% FROM 2002,

REFLECTING HIGHER INCENTIVES RELATED TO

IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE

IMPACT OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS.

NONCOMPENSATION COSTS WERE UP 4% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASES IN TECHNOLOGY

AND OCCUPANCY COSTS. SEVERANCE AND RELATED

COSTS OF $347 MILLION WERE DOWN 41%. THE

OVERHEAD RATIO FOR 2003 WAS 59%, COMPARED

WITH 64% IN 2002.

CREDIT COSTS

WERE NEGATIVE $181 MILLION,

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

IN 2004, THE COMPOSITION OF IBS REVENUES

IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE. GROWTH IN

CLIENT-RELATED REVENUE MAY BE OFFSET BY

POTENTIALLY LOWER SECURITIES GAINS AND NII. NII MAY BE LOWER

DUE TO DECREASED SPREADS ON INVESTMENT

SECURITIES AND LOWER LOAN VOLUMES. THE IB CREDIT

OUTLOOK IS STABLE, ALTHOUGH CREDIT COSTS

MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE UNUSUALLY LOW

LEVELS SEEN IN 2003.

OPERATING EARNINGS

DECREASED BY 16% FROM

2002 WHILE DELIVERING A RETURN ON

ALLOCATED CAPITAL OF 19%. INCREASED

OPERATING EXPENSE OF 7% AND A LOWER

CORPORATE CREDIT ALLOCATION CONTRIBUTED TO

THE LOWER EARNINGS.

OPERATING REVENUE

GROWTH AT INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES

(ITS) OF 7%. ITS REVENUE GROWTH CAME

FROM DEBT

IN 2003. TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE ROSE

6% ON HIGHER TRADE AND COMMERCIAL PAYMENT

CARD REVENUE AND INCREASED BALANCE-RELATED

EARNINGS, INCLUDING HIGHER BALANCE

DEFICIENCY FEES RESULTING FROM THE LOWER

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. INVESTOR

SERVICES REVENUE CONTRACTED 4%, THE

RESULT OF LOWER NII DUE TO LOWER INTEREST

RATES, COUPLED WITH LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE

AND SECURITIES LENDING REVENUE.

TSS RESULTS INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$41 MILLION ON THE SALE OF A NONSTRATEGIC

BUSINESS IN 2003, COMPARED WITH A PRE-TAX

GAIN OF $50 MILLION ON THE SALE OF THE

FIRMS INTEREST IN A NON-U.S. SECURITIES

CLEARING FIRM IN 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSE

INCREASED BY 7%,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SEVERANCE, THE

IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, THE COST

SHARED WITH TSS. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

REVISED TO REFLECT THIS ALLOCATION. FOR

2003, THE IMPACT TO TSS OF THIS CHANGE

$712 MILLION, AND IT DECREASED SVA BY $65

FROM TWO RECENT ACQUISITIONS: THE NOVEMBER

2003 ACQUISITION OF THE BANK ONE CORPORATE

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING

(IMPB) OPERATING EARNINGS ARE INFLUENCED

BY NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EQUITY,

FIXED INCOME AND OTHER ASSET VALUATIONS;

INVESTOR FLOWS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS;

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE; AND EXPENSE AND

RISK MANAGEMENT. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS REBOUNDED IN 2003, AS CORPORATE

EARNINGS IMPROVED AND THE CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT STRENGTHENED. DURING 2003,

GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS ROSE (AS EXEMPLIFIED

BY THE S&P 500 INDEX, WHICH ROSE BY 26%,

AND THE MSCI WORLD INDEX, WHICH ROSE BY

31%), AND INVESTOR ACTIVITY LEVELS INCREASED ACROSS IMPBS RETAIL AND PRIVATE

BANK CLIENT BASES,

PARTICULARLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR. THIS GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET RECOVERY,

ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, BROUGHT 2003S

AVERAGE ANNUAL MARKET LEVELS BROADLY BACK

IN LINE WITH 2002S AVERAGE. INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE IN CORE INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS

IMPROVED WITH ALL MAJOR ASSET CLASSES,

WITH U.S. INSTITUTIONAL FIXED INCOME AND

EQUITIES MARKETS SHOWING ABOVE-BENCHMARK

RESULTS.

IMPBS

OPERATING EARNINGS

WERE 3% HIGHER

THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN

IMPROVED CREDIT PORTFOLIO, THE BENEFITS OF

SLIGHTLY HIGHER REVENUES AND MANAGED

EXPENSE GROWTH. QUARTERLY EARNINGS

INCREASED SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE YEAR.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE

FIRM ACQUIRED AMERICAN CENTURY RETIREMENT

PLAN SERVICES INC., A PROVIDER OF DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION RECORDKEEPING SERVICES, AS

PART OF ITS STRATEGY TO GROW ITS U.S.

RETAIL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. THE

BUSINESS WAS RENAMED JPMORGAN RETIREMENT

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN PARTNERS (JPMP) RECOGNIZED

NEGATIVE OPERATING REVENUE

OF $190 MILLION

AND

OPERATING LOSSES

OF $293 MILLION IN

2003. OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE VALUE

THROUGH SALES, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS) OF

INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH LIMITED, IMPROVED

DURING THE YEAR AS THE M&A AND IPO MARKETS

STARTED TO RECOVER.

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS TOTALED $27 MILLION

IN 2003, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $733

MILLION IN 2002. JPMP RECOGNIZED GAINS OF

$346 MILLION ON DIRECT INVESTMENTS AND

LOSSES OF $319 MILLION ON SALES AND

WRITEDOWNS OF PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY FUND

INVESTMENTS.

REALIZED CASH GAINS ON DIRECT INVESTMENTS

OF $535 MILLION INCREASED 18% FROM THE

PREVIOUS YEAR. REALIZED CASH GAINS WERE

RECOGNIZED ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES BUT WERE

PRIMARILY REALIZED FROM THE INDUSTRIAL

AND CONSUMER RETAIL AND SERVICES SECTORS.

IN ADDITION, JPMP RECORDED UNREALIZED

GAINS OF $215 MILLION

FROM

THE MARK-TO-MARKET

(MTM) VALUE OF ITS PUBLIC

PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY IN THE HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE,

TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SECTORS.

JPMPS UNREALIZED AND REALIZED GAINS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET WRITE-OFFS

(REALIZED LOSSES) AND WRITE-DOWNS

(UNREALIZED LOSSES) ON THE DIRECT

PORTFOLIO OF $404 MILLION. THESE

WRITE-DOWNS AND WRITE-OFFS INCLUDED $239

INVESTMENT PACE, PORTFOLIO

DIVERSIFICATION AND CAPITAL UNDER

MANAGEMENT

IN 2003, INCREASED EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON

LEVERAGED BUYOUTS AND GROWTH EQUITY

OPPORTUNITIES. JPMPS DIRECT INVESTMENTS

FOR THE FIRMS ACCOUNT IN 2003 WERE $773

MILLION, A 19% DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR. APPROXIMATELY 67% OF DIRECT

INVESTMENTS WERE IN THE INDUSTRIAL,

CONSUMER RETAIL AND SERVICES, LIFE

SCIENCES AND HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE

SECTORS.

JPMP REDUCED THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO BY

12%, LARGELY THE RESULT OF SALES OF

THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS, WHICH

DECLINED BY $744 MILLION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE CARRYING VALUE

OF JPMPS PUBLIC SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS

$643 MILLION, A 24% INCREASE FROM 2002.

THE INCREASE RESULTED FROM HIGHER MARKET

VALUATIONS AND FROM IPOS OF CERTAIN

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

ONGOING SALES ACTIVITY.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REGARD JPMP AS A

STRATEGIC BUSINESS THAT WILL CREATE VALUE

OVER THE LONG TERM. JPMP IS SEEKING TO SELL

SELECTED INVESTMENTS THAT

ARE NOT CENTRAL TO ITS PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WITH

THE GOAL THAT, OVER TIME, JPMPS PRIVATE

EQUITY PORTFOLIO WILL REPRESENT A LOWER

PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS COMMON

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

JPMPS PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO AND

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE

LEVEL OF M&A, IPO AND DEBT FINANCING

ACTIVITY. IMPROVED MARKETS IN 2004 COULD

PROVIDE INCREASED EXIT OPPORTUNITIES AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW

CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES (CFS)

OPERATING

EARNINGS

ARE AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS,

INCLUDING U.S. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE

VOLATILITY AND LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES,

AND COMPETITION IN ITS VARIOUS PRODUCT

LINES. IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTINUING

LOWINTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND

COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE, IN 2003,

CFS FOCUSED ITS EFFORTS ON GROWING OR

MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE IN ITS VARIOUS

BUSINESSES, ENHANCING ITS ONLINE BANKING

CAPABILITIES,

DISCIPLINED EXPENSE MANAGEMENT AND

MAINTAINING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS LOAN

PORTFOLIOS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE EFFORTS, 2003 CFS OPERATING

EARNINGS WERE A RECORD $2.5 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF 8% FROM 2002. RETURN ON

ALLOCATED CAPITAL WAS 28%, UP FROM 27% IN

2002. SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED INCREASED

BY 12%.

OPERATING REVENUE

WAS $14.6 BILLION IN

2003, AN INCREASE OF 9% OVER 2002. NET

INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 17% TO $9.6

BILLION, REFLECTING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF

THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT ON

CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS, PARTICULARLY

IN CHASE HOME FINANCE (CHF), AND LOWER

FUNDING COSTS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTLY

OFFSET BY REDUCED SPREADS ON DEPOSITS. CHF

REVENUE INCREASED BY 38% OVER THE PRIOR

YEAR, DRIVEN BY STRONG OPERATING REVENUE

(WHICH EXCLUDES MSR HEDGING REVENUE) AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER MSR HEDGING

REVENUE. CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES (CCS)

REVENUE INCREASED BY 4%, THE RESULT OF

LOWER FUNDING COSTS, GROWTH IN AVERAGE

RECEIVABLES AND HIGHER INTERCHANGE FEES

EARNED ON CUSTOMER PURCHASES. CHASE AUTO

FINANCE (CAF) REVENUE GREW 23%, DRIVEN

BY RECORD ORIGINATIONS OF ALMOST $28

BILLION AND LOWER FUNDING COSTS. CHASE

REGIONAL BANKING (CRB) AND CHASE MIDDLE

MARKET (CMM) REVENUES DECREASED 9% AND

1%, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF LOWER

DEPOSIT SPREADS FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES,

PARTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DEPOSIT VOLUMES

COMPARED WITH 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSE

ROSE 10% TO $7.3

BILLION. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE REFLECTS

HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUME AND HIGHER

COMPENSATION COSTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

HIGHER EXPENSES WERE SAVINGS ACHIEVED

THROUGH SIX SIGMA AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY

EFFORTS. THE OVERHEAD RATIO INCREASED

SLIGHTLY COMPARED WITH A YEAR AGO.

CREDIT COSTS

ON A MANAGED BASIS (WHICH

INCLUDES SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS) OF $3.4

BILLION INCREASED BY 9% COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR. WHILE CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED

STABLE IN 2003, NET CHARGE-OFFS INCREASED

BY 2%. THE INCREASE IN 2003 NET

CHARGE-OFFS WAS DRIVEN BY A 19% INCREASE

IN AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT

PORTFOLIO, SEE CREDIT RISK ON PAGES 6162

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

IN 2004, CFS ANTICIPATES OPERATING REVENUE

AND EARNINGS WILL BE LOWER, PRIMARILY DUE

TO A DECREASE IN PRODUCTION REVENUE IN

CHF, AS REFINANCING ACTIVITY DECLINES FROM

THE RECORD LEVELS SET IN 2003. WHILE CFS

EXPECTS THE OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES TO

REPORT MODEST REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVED

EFFICIENCIES, THIS GROWTH MAY NOT OFFSET

CHF IS THE FOURTH LARGEST MORTGAGE

ORIGINATOR AND SERVICER IN THE UNITED

STATES, WITH MORE THAN FOUR MILLION

CUSTOMERS. CHF CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN ALL 50

STATES AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 17,000

EMPLOYEES IN MORE THAN 300 LOCATIONS

NATIONWIDE. CHF OFFERS AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY

OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS DELIVERED

ACROSS A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

AND CUSTOMER TOUCH POINTS. CHF COMPRISES

THREE KEY BUSINESSES: PRODUCTION,

SERVICING AND

PORTFOLIO LENDING. THE PRODUCTION BUSINESS

ORIGINATES AND SELLS MORTGAGES. THE

SERVICING BUSINESS MANAGES ACCOUNTS FOR

CHFS FOUR MILLION CUSTOMERS. THE

PORTFOLIO LENDING BUSINESS HOLDS FOR

INVESTMENT ADJUSTABLE-RATE FIRST MORTGAGE

LOANS, HOME EQUITY AND MANUFACTURED

HOUSING LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED

THROUGH THE PRODUCTION CHANNELS. THESE

THREE SEGMENTS PROVIDE CHF WITH BALANCE TO

ENABLE IT TO BENEFIT ACROSS VARYING

BUSINESS CYCLES. THE PRODUCTION SEGMENT IS

MOST PROFITABLE WHEN MORTGAGE RATES ARE

DECLINING AND ORIGINATION VOLUME IS HIGH.

ALTERNATIVELY, THE SERVICING BUSINESS

COLLECTS MORE FEES WHEN RATES ARE RISING

AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS ARE LOW.

PORTFOLIO LENDING PROVIDES INCREASING NII,

WITH GROWTH IN HOME EQUITY AND

ADJUSTABLE-RATE FIRST MORTGAGE LENDING.

THE COUNTER-CYCLICAL

(PRODUCTION/SERVICING) AND COMPLEMENTARY

(PORTFOLIO LENDING) NATURE OF THESE

BUSINESSES, IN COMBINATION WITH FINANCIAL

RISK MANAGEMENT, ENABLED CHF TO PRODUCE

RECORD EARNINGS.

THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET HAD A

RECORD YEAR IN 2003, WITH AN ESTIMATED

$3.8 TRILLION IN INDUSTRY-WIDE

ORIGINATION VOLUME. THE STRONG MARKET WAS

DRIVEN BY HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST

RATES, HIGHER CONSUMER CONFIDENCE,

IMPROVED HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND

EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG NEW AND EXISTING

HOME SALES. CHF CAPITALIZED ON THIS

CHFS BUSINESS RESULTS TO THE REPORTED

GAAP LINE ITEMS SHOWN ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME AND IN THE RELATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. WHILE THE OPERATING AND

MSR HEDGING FUNCTION IS A RISK MANAGEMENT

INCREASED BY 48% FROM 2002.

CHFS

OPERATING REVENUE (EXCLUDING MSR HEDGING REVENUE) OF $3.8 BILLION

INCREASED BY 38% OVER 2002. THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE WAS DUE TO RECORD PRODUCTION

REVENUE RESULTING FROM MARKET-SHARE

GROWTH, RECORD MARGINS AND HIGHER HOME

EQUITY REVENUE. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS A

DECREASE IN REVENUE IN 2004, AS PRODUCTION

MARGINS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE DUE TO

LOWER ORIGINATION VOLUMES AND INCREASED

PRICE COMPETITION.

IN ITS HEDGING ACTIVITIES, CHF USES A

COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES AND AFS

SECURITIES TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO

OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF

MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENT.

DURING 2003, NEGATIVE MSR VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS OF $785 MILLION WERE MORE

THAN OFFSET BY $1.0 BILLION OF AGGREGATE

DERIVATIVE GAINS, REALIZED GAINS ON SALES

OF AFS SECURITIES AND NET INTEREST EARNED

ON AFS SECURITIES. UNREALIZED

GAINS/(LOSSES) ON AFS SECURITIES WERE

$(144) MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND

$377 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSRS, SEE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ON PAGE 77 AND NOTE

16 ON PAGES 107109 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATING EXPENSE OF $1.7 BILLION

INCREASED BY 28% FROM 2002 AS A RESULT OF

GROWTH IN ORIGINATION VOLUME AS WELL AS A

HIGHER LEVEL OF MORTGAGE SERVICING.

SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF CHFS EXPENSES ARE

VARIABLE IN NATURE AND, ACCORDINGLY,

FLUCTUATE WITH THE OVERALL LEVEL OF

ORIGINATION AND SERVICING ACTIVITY. IN

ADDITION TO INCREASES BROUGHT ON BY HIGHER

BUSINESS VOLUMES, EXPENSES INCREASED DUE

TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES,

AS WELL AS STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS MADE TO

FURTHER EXPAND INTO HIGHER-MARGIN BUSINESS

SECTORS, ALONG WITH PRODUCTION-RELATED

RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS INITIATED IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. THESE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED GAINS

IN PRODUCTIVITY AND BENEFITS REALIZED FROM

SIX SIGMA INITIATIVES DURING 2003.

CREDIT COSTS OF $240 MILLION FOR 2003

INCREASED BY 26% FROM 2002 DUE TO A

HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER LOAN

BALANCES. CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUED TO BE

STRONG RELATIVE TO 2002, AS EVIDENCED BY

A LOWER NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO AND 30+ DAY

CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES

CCS IS THE FOURTH LARGEST U.S. CREDIT CARD

ISSUER, WITH $52.3 BILLION IN MANAGED

RECEIVABLES AND $89.7 BILLION IN TOTAL

VOLUME (CUSTOMER PURCHASES, CASH ADVANCES

AND BALANCE TRANSFERS). IN ADDITION, CCS

IS THE LARGEST U.S. MERCHANT ACQUIRER (AN

ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS WITH MERCHANTS TO

FACILITATE THE ACCEPTANCE OF TRANSACTION

CARDS), WITH ANNUAL SALES VOLUME IN EXCESS

OF $260 BILLION, THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE

WITH FIRST DATA MERCHANT SERVICES.

CCSS OPERATING RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT

OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. CCS

PERIODICALLY SECURITIZES A PORTION OF ITS

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO BY TRANSFERRING A

POOL OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A

TRUST, WHICH SELLS SECURITIES TO

INVESTORS. CCS RECEIVES FEE REVENUE FOR

CONTINUING TO SERVICE THOSE RECEIVABLES

AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM ANY INTEREST

AND FEES ON THE RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF

THE INTEREST PAID TO INVESTORS, NET OF

CREDIT LOSSES AND SERVICING FEES. CCS

REPORTS CREDIT COSTS ON A MANAGED OR

OPERATING BASIS. CREDIT COSTS

ON AN OPERATING BASIS ARE COMPOSED OF THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (WHICH

INCLUDES A PROVISION FOR CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET) AS WELL AS THE CREDIT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD

LOANS. AS THE HOLDER OF THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST IN THE SECURITIZATION TRUST, CCS

BEARS ITS SHARE OF THE CREDIT COSTS FOR

SECURITIZED LOANS. IN JPMORGAN CHASES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CREDIT

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIZED CREDIT

CARD LOANS REDUCE THE NONINTEREST INCOME

REMITTED TO THE FIRM FROM THE

SECURITIZATION TRUST. THIS INCOME IS

REPORTED IN CREDIT CARD FEES, IN FEES

AND COMMISSIONS, OVER THE LIFE OF THE

SECURITIZATION.

SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE CCSS

HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE CLASSIFICATION

OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY 3% OVER

REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CREDIT

COSTS AND EXPENSES. THE OPERATING

ENVIRONMENT REFLECTED CONTINUED

COMPETITIVE PRICING, A RECORD LEVEL OF

BANKRUPTCY FILINGS AND LOW RECEIVABLES

GROWTH. THIS WAS PARTLY THE RESULT OF

MORTGAGE REFINANCING ACTIVITY, WHICH

PERMITTED CONSUMERS TO USE CASH RECEIVED

IN THEIR MORTGAGE REFINANCINGS TO PAY DOWN

CREDIT CARD DEBT. CCS WAS ABLE TO GROW

EARNINGS AND ORIGINATE A RECORD NUMBER OF

NEW ACCOUNTS BY OFFERING REWARDS-BASED

PRODUCTS, IMPROVING OPERATING EFFICIENCY,

DELIVERING HIGH-LEVEL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND

IMPROVING RETENTION AND CARD USAGE.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE SHIFT TOWARDS

REWARDS-BASED PRODUCTS POSITIONS CCS TO

CAPTURE CONSUMER WALLET SHARE IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE, COMMODITIZED MARKETPLACE. IN

2003, CCS LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW REWARDS

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE CHASEPERFECT CARD,

THE MARATHON CO-BRANDED CARD AND THE GM

SMALL BUSINESS CARD.

OPERATING REVENUE INCREASED BY 4% TO $6.2

BILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED BY

2%, REFLECTING LOWER FUNDING COSTS, PARTLY

OFFSET BY A LOWER YIELD. THE 4% GROWTH IN

AVERAGE RECEIVABLES WAS IN LINE WITH

INDUSTRY TRENDS. NONINTEREST REVENUE

INCREASED BY 6%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

HIGHER INTERCHANGE REVENUE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER REBATE COSTS. THE

INCREASE IN INTERCHANGE REVENUE REFLECTS

HIGHER PURCHASE VOLUME DUE TO NEW ACCOUNT

GROWTH AND THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS HIGHER

SPENDING USING REWARDS-BASED PRODUCTS.

DURING 2003, CCS ORIGINATED 4.2 MILLION

NEW ACCOUNTS VIA MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS. CCS CONTINUES

TO MAKE PROGRESS IN CROSS-SELLING

ACCOUNTS TO OTHER CFS CUSTOMERS (13% OF

NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS). THESE

MULTIPLE-RELATIONSHIP ACCOUNTS GENERATE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

CHASE AUTO FINANCE

CAF IS THE LARGEST U.S. BANK ORIGINATOR OF

AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND LEASES, WITH MORE

THAN 2.9 MILLION ACCOUNTS. IN 2003, CAF

HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILE LOAN AND

LEASE ORIGINATIONS, GROWING BY 10% OVER

2002 TO $27.8 BILLION. LOAN AND LEASE

RECEIVABLES OF $43.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, WERE 16% HIGHER THAN AT THE

PRIOR YEAR-END. DESPITE A CHALLENGING

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT REFLECTING SLIGHTLY

DECLINING NEW CAR SALES IN 2003 AND

INCREASED COMPETITION, CAFS MARKET SHARE

AMONG AUTOMOBILE FINANCE COMPANIES

IMPROVED TO 6.1% IN 2003 FROM 5.7% IN

2002. THE INCREASE IN MARKET SHARE WAS THE

RESULT OF STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH AND AN

ORIGINATION STRATEGY THAT ALLIES THE

BUSINESS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS.

CAFS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEVERAL MAJOR CAR

MANUFACTURERS CONTRIBUTED TO 2003 GROWTH,

AS DID CAFS DEALER RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH

INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 12,700

DEALERS IN 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY 13,700

DEALERS IN 2003.

IN 2003, OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $205

MILLION, 23% HIGHER COMPARED WITH 2002.

THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS WAS DRIVEN BY

CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVED

OPERATING EFFICIENCY. IN 2003, CAFS

OPERATING REVENUE GREW BY 23% TO $842

MILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME GREW BY 33%

COMPARED WITH 2002. THE INCREASE WAS

DRIVEN BY STRONG OPERATING PERFORMANCE

DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE LOANS AND LEASES

OUTSTANDING, REFLECTING CONTINUED STRONG

ORIGINATION VOLUME AND LOWER FUNDING

COSTS.

OPERATING EXPENSE OF $292 MILLION

INCREASED BY 18% COMPARED WITH 2002. THE

INCREASE IN EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

AVERAGE

LOANS OUTSTANDING, HIGHER ORIGINATION

VOLUME AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

INCENTIVES. CAFS OVERHEAD RATIO IMPROVED

FROM 36% IN 2002 TO 35% IN 2003, AS A

RESULT OF STRONG REVENUE GROWTH, CONTINUED

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND DISCIPLINED EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT.

CREDIT COSTS INCREASED 18% TO $205

MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A 32%

INCREASE IN AVERAGE LOAN AND LEASE

RECEIVABLES. CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUED TO

BE STRONG RELATIVE TO 2002, AS EVIDENCED

BY A LOWER NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO AND 30+

DAY DELINQUENCY RATE.

CAF ALSO COMPRISES CHASE EDUCATION

FINANCE, A TOP PROVIDER OF

GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED AND PRIVATE LOANS

FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. LOANS ARE PROVIDED

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE WITH SALLIE MAE, A

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE AND THE

LEADER IN FUNDING AND SERVICING EDUCATION

LOANS. CHASE EDUCATION FINANCES

ORIGINATION VOLUME TOTALED $2.7 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF 4% FROM LAST YEAR.

CHASE REGIONAL BANKING

CRB IS THE NO. 1 BANK IN THE NEW YORK

TRI-STATE AREA AND A TOP FIVE BANK IN

TEXAS (BOTH RANKED BY RETAIL DEPOSITS),

PROVIDING PAYMENT, LIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT,

INSURANCE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER

SEGMENTS: SMALL BUSINESS, AFFLUENT AND

RETAIL. WITHIN THESE SEGMENTS, CRB SERVES

326,000 SMALL BUSINESSES, 433,000

AFFLUENT CONSUMERS AND 2.6 MILLION

MASS-MARKET CONSUMERS.

CRBS CONTINUED FOCUS ON EXPANDING

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS RESULTED IN A 14%

INCREASE IN CORE DEPOSITS (FOR THIS PURPOSE, CORE DEPOSITS ARE TOTAL DEPOSITS

LESS TIME DEPOSITS) FROM DECEMBER 31,

2002, AND A 77% INCREASE IN THE CROSS-SELL

OF CHASE CREDIT PRODUCTS OVER 2002. IN

2003, MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY

ORIGINATIONS THROUGH CRBS DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS WERE $3.4 BILLION AND $4.7

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BRANCH-ORIGINATED

CREDIT CARDS TOTALED 77,000, CONTRIBUTING

TO 23% OF CRB CUSTOMERS HOLDING CHASE

CREDIT CARDS. CRB IS COMPENSATED BY CFSS

CREDIT BUSINESSES FOR THE HOME FINANCE AND

CREDIT CARD LOANS IT ORIGINATES AND DOES

NOT RETAIN THESE BALANCES.

WHILE CRB CONTINUES TO POSITION ITSELF FOR

GROWTH, DECREASED DEPOSIT SPREADS RELATED

TO THE LOW-RATE ENVIRONMENT AND INCREASED

CREDIT COSTS RESULTED IN AN 80% DECLINE IN

CRB OPERATING EARNINGS FROM 2002. THIS

DECREASE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN 8%

INCREASE IN TOTAL AVERAGE DEPOSITS.

OPERATING REVENUE OF $2.6 BILLION

DECREASED BY 9% COMPARED WITH 2002. NET

INTEREST INCOME DECLINED BY 11% TO $1.7

BILLION, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.

NONINTEREST REVENUE DECREASED 6% TO $927

MILLION DUE TO LOWER DEPOSIT SERVICE FEES,

DECREASED DEBIT CARD FEES AND ONE-TIME

GAINS IN 2002. CRBS REVENUE DOES NOT

INCLUDE FUNDING PROFITS EARNED ON ITS

DEPOSIT BASE; THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED

IN THE RESULTS OF GLOBAL TREASURY.

OPERATING EXPENSE OF $2.4 BILLION

INCREASED BY 7% FROM 2002. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE BRANCH NETWORK; ALSO

CONTRIBUTING WERE HIGHER COMPENSATION

EXPENSES RELATED TO INCREASED STAFF LEVELS

AND HIGHER SEVERANCE COSTS AS A RESULT OF

CONTINUED RESTRUCTURING. THIS INCREASE IN

OPERATING

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPENSE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY SIX SIGMA

AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS. CRBS

OVERHEAD RATIO INCREASED TO 93% IN 2003

FROM 79% IN 2002, REFLECTING BOTH THE

DECLINE IN REVENUES AND AN INCREASE OF

EXPENSES.

CREDIT COSTS OF $77 MILLION INCREASED BY

$88 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2002 PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY THE RELEASE OF THE ALLOWANCE

ATTRIBUTED TO THE SHARED ACTIVITIES WITH

TREASURY SERVICES. SEE SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGE 27 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS REVENUE AND

EXPENSE-SHARING AGREEMENTS AMONG BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

CMMS OPERATING EARNINGS OF $324 MILLION

INCREASED BY 3% COMPARED WITH 2002.

OPERATING REVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION

DECREASED BY 1% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR. NII WAS DOWN 5% DUE TO LOWER

SPREADS, PARTLY OFFSET BY 17% HIGHER

DEPOSITS

AND 3% HIGHER LOANS COMPARED WITH 2002.

NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED BY 6%,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER DEPOSIT

SERVICE AND CORPORATE FINANCE FEES.

DEPOSIT SERVICE FEES INCREASED, AS THE

LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT RESULTED

IN REDUCED VALUES OF CUSTOMERS

COMPENSATING BALANCES; CONSEQUENTLY,

CUSTOMERS PAID INCREMENTAL FEES FOR

DEPOSIT SERVICES.

OPERATING EXPENSE WAS $871 MILLION, AN

INCREASE OF 4% COMPARED WITH 2002. THE

INCREASE IN EXPENSES WAS DUE TO HIGHER

SEVERANCE COSTS AND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, PARTLY

OFFSET BY SAVINGS FROM SIX SIGMA AND OTHER

PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES.

CREDIT COSTS OF $7 MILLION WERE DOWN 90%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS

DUE TO A LOWER REQUIRED ALLOWANCE AND 36%

LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS, REFLECTING STRONG

CREDIT QUALITY.

THE FOCUS FOR 2004 WILL BE ON GENERATING

REVENUE GROWTH THROUGH

EFFECTIVE CROSS-SELLING, THE DELIVERY OF

SUPERIOR CLIENT SERVICE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT QUALITY AND EXPENSES.

THE SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE SECTOR

INCLUDES TECHNOLOGY, LEGAL, AUDIT,

FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, RISK

MANAGEMENT, REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT,

PROCUREMENT, EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND

MARKETING GROUPS WITHIN CORPORATE. THE

TECHNOLOGY AND PROCUREMENT SERVICES

ORGANIZATIONS SEEK TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES THAT ARE

COMPETITIVE WITH COMPARABLE THIRD-PARTY

PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF PRICE AND SERVICE

QUALITY. THESE UNITS USE THE FIRMS

GLOBAL SCALE AND TECHNOLOGY TO GAIN

EFFICIENCIES THROUGH CONSOLIDATION,

STANDARDIZATION, VENDOR MANAGEMENT AND

OUTSOURCING.

SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE REFLECTS THE

APPLICATION OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AT THE CORPORATE

LEVEL. THESE POLICIES ALLOCATE THE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL

AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, WITH THE INTENT TO RECOVER ALL

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

SERVICES. OTHER ITEMS ARE RETAINED WITHIN

SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE BASED ON

POLICY DECISIONS, SUCH AS THE OVER/UNDER

ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL, THE

RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF CREDIT COSTS AND

TAXES. BUSINESS SEGMENT REVENUES ARE

REPORTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WITH

THE OFFSET REFLECTED IN SUPPORT UNITS AND

CORPORATE.

DURING 2003, THE FIRM REVIEWED ITS

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH

RESULTED IN THE REALIGNMENT OF CERTAIN

REVENUES AND EXPENSES FROM THE CORPORATE

SEGMENT TO OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

POLICY REFINEMENTS RANGED FROM UPDATING

EXPENSE-ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES TO

REVISING TRANSFER PRICING POLICIES TO MORE

CLEARLY REFLECT THE ACTUAL INTEREST INCOME

AND EXPENSE OF THE FIRM. THE IMPACT OF

THESE CHANGES WAS ALLOCATED AMONG THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS; PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

REVISED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT

METHODOLOGIES.

FOR 2003, SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE HAD

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $44 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH AN OPERATING LOSS OF $313

MILLION IN 2002, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

INCOME TAX BENEFITS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

IN ALLOCATING THE ALLOWANCE (AND

PROVISION) FOR CREDIT LOSSES, EACH

BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CREDIT

COSTS. ALTHOUGH THE SUPPORT UNITS AND

CORPORATE SECTOR HAS NO TRADITIONAL CREDIT

ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE

ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR LOSSES

IN ANY BUSINESS SEGMENT, IS MAINTAINED AT

THE CORPORATE LEVEL. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT, SEE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON PAGES 64-65

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL WAS $2.9

BILLION HIGHER THAN 2002, REFLECTING A

REDUCTION IN RISKS AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL

ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERED

INTO A SEVEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH IBM TO

OUTSOURCE PORTIONS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES.

COMMENCING APRIL 1, 2003, 2,800 EMPLOYEES

WERE TRANSFERRED TO IBM IN CONNECTION WITH

THIS AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED

TO TRANSFORM THE FIRMS TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH INCREASED COST

VARIABILITY, ACCESS TO THE BEST RESEARCH

AND INNOVATION, AND IMPROVED SERVICE

LEVELS. BY MOVING FROM A TRADITIONAL

FIXED-COST APPROACH TO ONE WITH INCREASED

CAPACITY AND COST VARIABILITY, THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE QUICKLY

TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT AT JPMORGAN CHASE IS

GUIDED BY SEVERAL PRINCIPLES,

INCLUDING.



DEFINED RISK GOVERNANCE



INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT



CONTINUAL EVALUATION OF RISK APPETITE,

MANAGED THROUGH RISK LIMITS



PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION



RISK ASSESSMENT AND MEASUREMENT,

INCLUDING VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS AND

PORTFOLIO STRESS TESTING



PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT (SVA) THAT

ALLOCATES RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL TO

BUSINESS UNITS AND CHARGES A COST AGAINST

THAT CAPITAL.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT BEGINS WITH

THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, WHICH REVIEWS THE GOVERNANCE OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, DELEGATING THE

FORMULATION OF POLICY AND DAY-TO-DAY RISK

OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT TO THE OFFICE OF

THE CHAIRMAN AND TO TWO CORPORATE RISK COMMITTEES: THE

CAPITAL COMMITTEE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

COMMITTEE.

THE

CAPITAL COMMITTEE

, CHAIRED BY THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FOCUSES ON

FIRM-WIDE CAPITAL PLANNING, INTERNAL

CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT. THE

RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

,

CHAIRED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, FOCUSES

ON CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL

RISK, BUSINESS RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK

AND FIDUCIARY RISK. BOTH RISK COMMITTEES

HAVE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY, WITH MAJOR

POLICY DECISIONS AND RISK EXPOSURES

SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE OFFICE OF THE

CHAIRMAN.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE,

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF

GUIDELINES AND POLICIES TO GOVERN THE

PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND

MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION,

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH

MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS

RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

THE FIRMS USE OF SVA, WHICH INCORPORATES

A RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL METHODOLOGY AS ITS

PRIMARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE, HAS

STRENGTHENED ITS RISK MANAGEMENT

DISCIPLINE BY CHARGING THE BUSINESSES THE

COST OF CAPITAL LINKED TO THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE

ACTIVITIES.

ASSESSES CAPITAL ADEQUACY UTILIZING

INTERNAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES.

THE FIRM ASSIGNS ECONOMIC CAPITAL BASED

PRIMARILY ON FIVE RISK FACTORS: CREDIT

RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND

BUSINESS RISK FOR EACH BUSINESS, AND

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, PRINCIPALLY FOR JPMP.

THE METHODOLOGIES QUANTIFY THESE RISKS AND

ASSIGN CAPITAL ACCORDINGLY. THESE

METHODOLOGIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE RISK

MANAGEMENT SECTIONS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

A REVIEW OF THE FIRMS RISK AND CAPITAL

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES WAS COMPLETED IN

2003, RESULTING IN THE REALLOCATION OF

CAPITAL AMONG THE RISK CATEGORIES AND

CERTAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE NEW CAPITAL

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES DID NOT RESULT

IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE TOTAL

CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AS A WHOLE.

PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE REVISED CAPITAL MEASUREMENT

METHODOLOGIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THESE NEW METHODOLOGIES, SEE CAPITAL

ALLOCATION FOR CREDIT RISK, OPERATIONAL

RISK AND BUSINESS RISK, AND PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK ON PAGES 52, 73 AND 74, RESPECTIVELY,

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. INTERNAL CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY CHANGE IN THE

FUTURE TO REFLECT REFINEMENTS OF ECONOMIC

CAPITAL METHODOLOGIES.

CAPITAL ALSO IS ASSESSED AGAINST BUSINESS

UNITS FOR CERTAIN NONRISK FACTORS.

BUSINESSES ARE ASSESSED CAPITAL EQUAL TO

100% OF ANY GOODWILL AND 50% FOR CERTAIN

OTHER INTANGIBLES GENERATED THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE

ASSESSES AN ASSET CAPITAL TAX AGAINST

MANAGED ASSETS AND SOME OFF-BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS. THESE ASSESSMENTS RECOGNIZE

THAT CERTAIN MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL

RATIOS MUST BE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ESTIMATES THE

PORTFOLIO EFFECT ON REQUIRED ECONOMIC

CAPITAL BASED ON CORRELATIONS OF RISK

ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES. THIS ESTIMATED

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT LEADS TO A

REDUCTION IN REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL FOR

THE FIRM.

THE TOTAL REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE AS DETERMINED BY ITS MODELS

AND AFTER CONSIDERING THE FIRMS ESTIMATED

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS IS THEN COMPARED

WITH AVAILABLE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TO EVALUATE OVERALL CAPITAL UTILIZATION.

THE FIRMS POLICY IS TO MAINTAIN AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF EXCESS CAPITAL TO

PROVIDE FOR GROWTH AND ADDITIONAL

PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES.

THE FIRMS CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH

IS INTERNALLY REQUIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, INCREASED BY $2.7 BILLION OVER

DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE CHANGE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE

COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $1.6

BILLION AND TO A $1.3 BILLION REDUCTION IN

AVERAGE CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, PRINCIPALLY IN RELATION TO

CREDIT RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL DECREASED BY $0.9

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE

TO A REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL EXPOSURES,

IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO AND AN INCREASE IN

HEDGING OF COMMERCIAL EXPOSURES USING

SINGLE-NAME CREDIT DERIVATIVES. PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF THE REDUCTION IN JPMPS PRIVATE

EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

REGULATORY CAPITAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES

PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, ESTABLISHES CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED

STANDARDS AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, FOR THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND

ITS STATE-CHARTERED BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY ESTABLISHES

SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS

FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES,

INCLUDING CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA, N.A.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED CAPITAL LEVELS

WELL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE TIER 1 AND TOTAL

CAPITAL RATIOS WERE 8.5% AND 11.8%,

RESPECTIVELY, AND THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE

RATIO WAS 5.6%. THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE

REVIEWS THE FIRMS CAPITAL LEVELS AND

POLICIES REGULARLY IN LIGHT OF CHANGING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS NEEDS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, TOTAL CAPITAL OF

JPMORGAN CHASE (THE SUM OF TIER 1 AND TIER

2 CAPITAL) WAS $59.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $5.3 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THIS INCREASE REFLECTED A $5.6 BILLION

INCREASE IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY A $3.8 BILLION INCREASE IN

RETAINED EARNINGS (NET INCOME LESS COMMON

AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS) GENERATED DURING THE

PERIOD, $1.1 BILLION IN TIER 1 TRUST

PREFERRED NET ISSUANCE AND $1.3 BILLION IN

NET STOCK ISSUANCES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

NEEDS AND THE DESIRED MATURITY PROFILE

OF ITS LIABILITIES.

OVERVIEW

LIQUIDITY RISK ARISES FROM THE GENERAL

FUNDING NEEDS OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES AND

IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES THE

IMPORTANCE OF SOUND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

AS A KEY FACTOR IN MAINTAINING STRONG

CREDIT RATINGS AND UTILIZES A LIQUIDITY

FRAMEWORK INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY

ACCESS AND MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS. THROUGH

ACTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, THE FIRM

SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO

REPLACE MATURING OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND

FUND ITS ASSETS AT APPROPRIATE MATURITIES

AND RATES IN ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE SETS THE OVERALL

LIQUIDITY POLICY FOR THE FIRM, REVIEWS THE

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN AND RECOMMENDS

BALANCE SHEET TARGETS FOR THE FIRM. THE

LIQUIDITY RISK COMMITTEE, REPORTING TO THE

LIQUIDITY ISSUES, PROVIDES POLICY GUIDANCE

AND MAINTAINS AN EVOLVING CONTINGENCY

ALSO REPORTS TO THE CAPITAL COMMITTEE,

IDENTIFIES AND MONITORS KEY BALANCE SHEET

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LIQUIDITY

MONITORING TOOLS TO HELP MAINTAIN

APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY THROUGH

NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. THE FIRMS

LIQUIDITY ANALYTICS RELY ON MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT ABOUT JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO

LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR USE THEM AS COLLATERAL

FOR BORROWINGS. THESE ANALYTICS ALSO

INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTS

HISTORICAL DATA ON

THE FUNDING OF LOAN COMMITMENTS (E.G.,

COMMERCIAL PAPER BACK-UP FACILITIES),

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, COMMITMENTS

WITH RATING TRIGGERS AND COLLATERAL

POSTING REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF SPES AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH

OBLIGATIONS ON PAGES 49-50 AS WELL AS NOTE

1, NOTE 13 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 86-87,

100-103 AND 103-106, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS THREE PRIMARY MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE.



HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM SURPLUS.

MEASURES THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANYS

ABILITY TO REPAY ALL OBLIGATIONS WITH A

MATURITY UNDER ONE YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE

ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BANKS TO PAY

DIVIDENDS TO THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IS

CONSTRAINED.



CASH CAPITAL SURPLUS: MEASURES THE

FIRMS ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A FULLY

COLLATERALIZED BASIS, ASSUMING ACCESS TO

UNSECURED FUNDING IS LOST.



BASIC SURPLUS: MEASURES JPMORGAN CHASE

BANKS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN A 90-DAY STRESS

EVENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRM WHERE

NO NEW FUNDING CAN BE RAISED TO MEET

OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE.

EACH OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY SURPLUS

POSITIONS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

INDICATES THAT JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED

FUNDING, INCLUDING CORE DEPOSITS, EXCEEDS

ILLIQUID ASSETS AND THAT THE FIRMS

OBLIGATIONS CAN BE MET IF ACCESS TO

FUNDING IS TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

AN EXTENSION OF THE FIRMS ONGOING

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS ITS CONTINGENCY

FUNDING PLAN, WHICH IS INTENDED TO HELP

THE FIRM MANAGE THROUGH LIQUIDITY STRESS

PERIODS. THE PLAN CONSIDERS TEMPORARY AND

LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS AND FORECASTS

POTENTIAL FUNDING NEEDS WHEN ACCESS TO

UNSECURED FUNDING IS SEVERELY LIMITED OR

NONEXISTENT. THESE SCENARIOS TAKE INTO

ACCOUNT BOTH ON-AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

EXPOSURES, EVALUATING ACCESS TO FUNDS BY

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK AND CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA, N.A.,

SEPARATELY.

FUNDING

CREDIT RATINGS.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY

OF UNSECURED FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY

CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION IN THESE

RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, AND COULD

INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDING OR TRIGGER

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH

CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE: A STABLE AND

DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM; STRONG CAPITAL

RATIOS; STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK

MANAGEMENT CONTROLS; DIVERSE FUNDING

SOURCES; AND STRONG LIQUIDITY MONITORING

PROCEDURES.

BALANCE SHEET.

THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS

INCREASED TO $771 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, FROM $759 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE DECEMBER 31, 2003, BALANCE SHEET

INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF ADOPTING FIN 46,

WHICH ADDED $10 BILLION TO TOTAL ASSETS,

INCLUDING $5.8 BILLION IN COMMERCIAL LOANS

PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH MULTI-SELLER

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS.

COMMERCIAL LOANS DECLINED $14.2 BILLION,

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 46,

AS A RESULT OF WEAKER LOAN DEMAND, AS WELL

AS THE FIRMS ONGOING EFFORTS TO REDUCE

COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE. CONSUMER LOANS

INCREASED $11.6 BILLION, LED BY STRONG

GROWTH IN MORTGAGE AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS,

DRIVEN BY THE FAVORABLE RATE ENVIRONMENT

THROUGHOUT 2003. CREDIT CARD LOANS

DECLINED MODESTLY, AFFECTED BY INCREASED

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER LEVELS

OF PAYMENTS FROM CASH REDEPLOYED FROM

CONSUMER MORTGAGE REFINANCINGS. THE

SECURITIES PORTFOLIO DECLINED DUE TO

CHANGES IN POSITIONING RELATED TO

STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN DEPOSITS

CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

SOURCES OF FUNDS.

THE DIVERSITY OF THE

FIRMS FUNDING SOURCES ENHANCES FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON ANY

ONE SOURCE, THEREBY MINIMIZING THE COST OF

FUNDS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING

MARKETS ACROSS THE GLOBE AND ACROSS A BROAD

INVESTOR BASE. LIQUIDITY IS GENERATED USING

A VARIETY OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS, FEDERAL

FUNDS PURCHASED, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS,

COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK NOTES, MEDIUM- AND

LONG-TERM DEBT, CAPITAL SECURITIES AND

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. A MAJOR SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS

PROVIDED BY ITS LARGE CORE DEPOSIT BASE.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, CORE DEPOSITS INCLUDE ALL U.S. DOMESTIC

DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FDIC, UP TO THE

LEGAL LIMIT OF $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR. IN

ADDITION TO CORE DEPOSITS, THE FIRM

BENEFITS FROM SUBSTANTIAL, STABLE DEPOSIT

BALANCES ORIGINATED BY TSS THROUGH THE

NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED

BY THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE

REPURCHASE AND ASSET SECURITIZATION

MARKETS. THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE EVALUATED

ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE THE

APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SECURED AND

UNSECURED FUNDING. THE ABILITY TO

SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED GAINS

ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY

DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND YIELDS

OF THE ASSETS SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY

NOT DEPENDENT ON THE

CREDIT RATINGS OF THE

ISSUING ENTITY. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE

FIRM AND ITS SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE

REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; THESE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDE

RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE

NOTES 13 AND 14 ON PAGES 100-103 AND

103-106, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ISSUANCE.

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS

NARROWED IN 2003 ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND

SECTORS, REFLECTING THE MARKET PERCEPTION

THAT CREDIT RISKS WERE IMPROVING SHARPLY

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AS THE NUMBER OF

DOWNGRADES DECLINED, CORPORATE BALANCE

SHEET CASH POSITIONS INCREASED, AND

CORPORATE PROFITS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREADS

OUTPERFORMED RELATIVE TO PEER SPREADS

FOLLOWING THE ENRON SETTLEMENT, REFLECTING

REDUCED HEADLINE RISK AND IMPROVED

EARNINGS PERFORMANCE. THIS RESULTED IN A

POSITIVE OVERALL SHIFT IN FIXED INCOME

INVESTOR SENTIMENT TOWARD JPMORGAN CHASE,

AS EVIDENCED BY INCREASED INVESTOR

PARTICIPATION IN DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND

EXTENSION OF DEBT MATURITIES. THE FIRM

TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ITS NARROWING CREDIT

SPREADS BY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT AND

CAPITAL SECURITIES OPPORTUNISTICALLY

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

DURING 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED

APPROXIMATELY $17.2 BILLION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT AND CAPITAL SECURITIES. DURING THE

YEAR, $8.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND

CAPITAL SECURITIES MATURED OR WAS

REDEEMED. IN ADDITION, IN 2003 THE FIRM

SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $13.3 BILLION OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $8.8 BILLION

OF CREDIT CARD LOANS AND $4.5 BILLION OF

AUTOMOBILE LOANS, RESULTING IN PRE-TAX

GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $168 MILLION,

$44 MILLION AND $13 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES

100-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DURING 2003, THE FIRM ADOPTED FIN 46 AND,

AS A RESULT, DECONSOLIDATED THE TRUSTS

THAT ISSUE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES.

THIS COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS

FOR THE FIRMS CAPITAL, BECAUSE IT MAY

CHANGE THE WAY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

VIEWS THE TIER 1 STATUS OF TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES. ON JULY 2, 2003, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A SUPERVISORY LETTER

INSTRUCTING BANKS AND BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL.

BASED ON THE TERMS OF THIS LETTER AND IN

CONSULTATION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INCLUDE ITS

TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TIER 1

CAPITAL. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

WILL CONTINUE TO PERMIT TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES TO COUNT AS TIER 1 CAPITAL IN

THE FUTURE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

NOTE 18 ON PAGES 110-111 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

DERIVATIVES ARE USED IN LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT AND FUNDING TO ACHIEVE THE

FIRMS DESIRED INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE.

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS

TO SWAP FIXED-RATE DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE

OBLIGATIONS AND TO SWAP FLOATING-RATE DEBT

TO FIXED-RATE OBLIGATIONS. DERIVATIVES

CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED TO HEDGE THE

VARIABILITY IN INTEREST RATES THAT ARISES

FROM OTHER FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS,

SUCH AS THE ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES),

SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES (SPVS), OR

VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES), ARE

AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY

FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC

PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. SPES ARE

NOT OPERATING ENTITIES; TYPICALLY THEY ARE

ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE

PURPOSE, HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND HAVE NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE

INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE

SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE ASSET PURCHASE BY

SELLING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. TO

INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CREDITORS OF OTHER

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER OF THE

ASSETS, SPES ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED TO BE

BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE. SPES ARE CRITICAL TO

THE FUNCTIONING OF MANY INVESTOR MARKETS,

INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MARKET FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, OTHER

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER. JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH

SPES IN THREE BROAD CATEGORIES OF

TRANSACTIONS: LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

(THROUGH QUALIFYING SPES), MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS, AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION.

CAPITAL IS HELD, AS APPROPRIATE, AGAINST

ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED

EXPOSURES SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS

OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION,

AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS

WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND

REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH

THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS

PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE

FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT

WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS WORLDWIDE RULES

OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES

FROM SELF-DEALING AND PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES

FROM ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN

TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR

FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

INTEREST.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES,

THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

FUNDING IF THE CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC

LEVELS, PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND F1 FOR

MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF THESE

LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WAS $34.0 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK

WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING UNDER

THESE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM COULD BE

REPLACED AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER.

ADDITIONALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND STRUCTURED

COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES FOR WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK HAS EXTENDED LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS, THE BANK COULD FACILITATE THE

SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE

SPE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS LENDING (E.G., LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS), TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE

RISK-ASSESSMENT PROCESS. PROCESSES IN PLACE ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT CREDIT

RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY ASSESSED, PROPERLY APPROVED, CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND

ACTIVELY MANAGED. RISK IS MANAGED AT BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION AND

PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE FIRM

ASSESSES AND MANAGES ALL CREDIT EXPOSURES, WHETHER THEY ARISE FROM TRANSACTIONS

RECORDED ON- OR OFFBALANCE SHEET.

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORT-

FOLIO DECLINED BY 9% IN 2003, REFLECTING A COMBINATION OF CONTINUED WEAK LOAN

DEMAND, THE FIRMS ONGOING GOAL OF REDUCING COMMERCIAL CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

AND REFINANCINGS INTO MORE LIQUID CAPITAL MARKETS. THE FIRMS SVA DISCIPLINE

DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF LOAN ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN

ABOVE THE COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. SVA REMAINS A CRITICAL DISCIPLINE IN

MAKING LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER CREDIT AND

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

DISCIPLINES.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

TO MEASURE COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBLIGOR

OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT; THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT; AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED ON

THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH EXPECTED

AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR EACH SEGMENT OF THE PORTFOLIO. EXPECTED LOSSES ARE

STATISTICALLY-BASED ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER TIME, ANTICIPATED AS A

RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THEY ARE USED TO SET RISK-ADJUSTED

CREDIT LOSS PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE

INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE EXPECTED LOSS RATE

COULD BE FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL AND RECURRING COST OF

DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED LOSSES REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL

LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LEVEL OF LOSSES AND ARE THE BASIS FOR THE

FIRMS CREDIT RISK CAPITAL-ALLOCATION PROCESS.

IN 2003, THE FIRM SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED ITS APPROACH TO COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT TO FURTHER ENHANCE RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE, IMPROVE RETURNS AND

LIQUIDITY AND USE CAPITAL MORE EFFICIENTLY. THREE PRIMARY INITIATIVES WERE

LAUNCHED DURING THE YEAR: IMPROVED SINGLE-NAME AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION

MANAGEMENT, THROUGH A REVISED THRESHOLD AND LIMIT STRUCTURE; A REVISED CAPITAL

METHODOLOGY; AND INCREASED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY UTILIZING CREDIT

DERIVATIVES AND LOAN SALES. THE FIRM MANAGES CAPITAL AND EXPOSURE

CONCENTRATIONS BY OBLIGOR, RISK RATING, INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY. THE FIRM HAS

REDUCED BY ONE-HALF THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHOSE CREDIT EXPOSURE EXCEEDED THE

NARROWEST DEFINITION OF CONCENTRATION LIMITS DURING 2003, THROUGH FOCUSED

CLIENT PLANNING AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

INFRASTRUCTURE WAS COMPLETED IN 2003. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM HAS COMMENCED A

MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REENGINEER SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE CREDIT RISK

INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING CREATION OF A SIMPLER INFRASTRUCTURE WITH MORE

STANDARDIZED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS. THE GOAL OF THE INITIATIVE IS TO

ENHANCE THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AND ACCURATE RISK AND EXPOSURE

INFORMATION; ACTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK IN THE RESIDUAL PORTFOLIO; SUPPORT

CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; MANAGE MORE QUICKLY THE ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL;

AND SUPPORT COMPLIANCE WITH BASEL II INITIATIVES.

CONSUMER

CONSUMER CREDIT RISKS ARE MONITORED AT THE AGGREGATE CFS LEVEL AND WITHIN EACH

LINE OF BUSINESS (MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARDS, AUTOMOBILE FINANCE, SMALL BUSINESS

AND CONSUMER BANKING).

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT USES SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT

SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. RISK PARAMETERS ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COST OF CREDIT RISK IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF PRODUCT

PRICING AND EVALUATING PROFIT DYNAMICS. LOSSES GENERATED BY CONSUMER LOANS ARE

MORE PREDICTABLE THAN FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO CYCLICAL AND

SEASONAL FACTORS. THE FREQUENCY OF LOSS IS HIGHER ON CONSUMER LOANS THAN ON

CORPORATE LOANS BUT THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND MORE

MANAGEABLE, DEPENDING ON WHETHER LOANS ARE SECURED OR NOT. IN ADDITION, COMMON

MEASURES OF CREDIT QUALITY DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE CAN BE USED

TO PREDICT CON-

SUMER LOSSES. LIKEWISE, UNDERWRITING PRINCIPLES AND PHILOSOPHIES ARE COMMON

AMONG LENDERS FOCUSING ON BORROWERS OF SIMILAR CREDIT QUALITY. FOR THESE

REASONS, CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS

AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN

UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND ADHERENCE TO PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT ALSO MONITORS KEY RISK ATTRIBUTES, INCLUDING BORROWER CREDIT

QUALITY, LOAN PERFORMANCE (AS MEASURED BY DELINQUENCY) AND LOSSES (EXPECTED

VERSUS ACTUAL). THE MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF TRENDS AROUND THESE

ATTRIBUTES IS MONITORED AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR CREDIT RISK

UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES DRIVE THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL BY

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT.

IN THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK

RATING, LOSS SEVERITY, MATURITY, CORRELATIONS AND ASSUMED EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT.

IN 2003, THE FIRM REVISED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO, MORE CLOSELY ALIGNING

CAPITAL WITH CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE NEW APPROACH EMPLOYS

ESTIMATES OF DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD THAT ARE DERIVED FROM CURRENT MARKET PARAMETERS

AND IS INTENDED TO CAPTURE THE IMPACT OF BOTH DEFAULTS AND DECLINES IN MARKET

VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION. THIS APPROACH IS INTENDED TO REFLECT MORE

ACCURATELY

CURRENT RISK CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS TO ENHANCE THE MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL

CREDIT RISK BY ENCOURAGING THE UTILIZATION OF THE GROWING MARKET IN CREDIT

DERIVATIVES AND SECONDARY MARKET LOAN SALES. SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SECTION

ON PAGES 4647 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WITHIN THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES, CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY

PRODUCT AND PRODUCT SEGMENT. FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE

PLACED INTO CATEGORIES WITH HOMOGENOUS CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS, FROM WHICH

DEFAULT RATES AND CHARGE-OFFS CAN BE ESTIMATED. CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS

ALLOCATED BASED ON THE UNEXPECTED LOSS INHERENT IN THOSE CATEGORIES.

COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE (WHICH INCLUDES $34.9 BILLION OF

SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS) WAS $730.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, A 2%

INCREASE FROM YEAR-END 2002. THE INCREASE REFLECTED A CHANGE IN THE PORTFOLIOS

COMPOSITION: A $41.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CONSUMER EXPOSURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A $30.2 BILLION DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE.

MANAGED CONSUMER LOANS INCREASED BY $15.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM

HIGHER LEVELS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND AUTOMOBILE ORIGINATIONS, WHILE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INCREASED BY $25.8 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN THE HOME

FINANCE AND CREDIT CARD BUSINESSES.

COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE DECREASED BY 7% TO $382.7 BILLION AS OF YEAR-END 2003, THE

RESULT OF AN $8.5 BILLION DECREASE IN LOANS AND A $22.4 BILLION DECREASE IN

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE DECREASE IN LOANS OUTSTANDING REFLECTED WEAKER

DEMAND, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS ONGOING CREDIT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

$5.2 BILLION IN LOAN AND COMMITMENT SALES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE RELATED TO VIES CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46.

THE DECREASE IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS DUE TO AN OVERALL CONTRACTION

IN LENDING DEMAND AND REFLECTED A $6.3 BILLION DECLINE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF

FIN 46. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FIN 46, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 103106 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ALSO VIEWS ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS, WHICH IS THE

BASIS UPON WHICH IT ALLOCATES CREDIT CAPITAL TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE

PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE ON A REPORTED BASIS AND

ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATES TO THE WAY THE FIRM VIEWS ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

FOR DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, THE FIRM MEASURES ITS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE

USING THE AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG) METRIC. THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED

MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS,

INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. THE THREE-YEAR AVERAGE OF THE AVG METRIC

IS THE FIRMS ECONOMIC MEASURE OF DERIVATIVE RISK SINCE THREE YEARS IS THE

AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO; IT WAS $34 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SECTION

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES ON A MTM BASIS WITH THE

FIRMS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE BASIS, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.

FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM MEASURES ITS ECONOMIC

CREDIT EXPOSURE USING A LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT, RATHER

THAN THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENT. THE CONTRACTUAL

AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW

DOWN THE COMMITMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE

COMMITMENTS EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A

RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE FIRMS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT

AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION

OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS LIKELY, BASED ON

AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF

A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR. IT IS THIS AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW,

REPRESENTS THE FIRMS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE TO THE OBLIGOR. THE AGGREGATE

AMOUNT OF ITS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $106.9 BILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $115.5

BILLION IN 2002.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, TOTAL ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS $572.4 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $548.0 BILLION AS OF YEAR-END 2002. ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE FOR

2003 WAS $572.4 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2003 CREDIT EXPOSURE OF $730.9 BILLION.

THE FIRMS ALLOCATED CREDIT CAPITAL (INCLUDING THE BENEFIT FROM CREDIT

DERIVATIVE HEDGES) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2003, TO

$10.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, FROM $15.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. THE

$5.1 BILLION DECREASE WAS RELATED TO LOWER EXPOSURE IN THE COMMERCIAL

PORTFOLIO, HEDGING AND LOAN SALE ACTIVITIES, AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CREDIT

QUALITY IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE MATURITY AND RATINGS PROFILES OF THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002. THE RATINGS SCALE IS

BASED ON THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS, AND IS PRESENTED ON AN

S&PEQUIVALENT BASIS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, 83% OF THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE OF $383

BILLION WAS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT-GRADE, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM 80% AT YEAR-END

2002. THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT ACROSS ALL COMPONENTS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, MOST

SIGNIFICANTLY

IN LOANS, AS COMMERCIAL CRITICIZED EXPOSURE DECLINED BY 47%, WHILE THE TOTAL

COMMERCIAL LOAN BALANCE DECLINED BY 9%.

UNDER THE FIRMS ECONOMIC VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO

THAT WAS DEEMED INVESTMENT-GRADE IMPROVED TO 80% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, FROM

74% AT YEAR-END 2002. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, THE INVESTMENT-GRADE COMPONENT OF DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES IMPROVED TO 91% AT YEAR-END 2003 FROM 85% AT THE END OF 2002.

COMMERCIAL EXPOSURE  SELECTED INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS

DURING 2003, THE FIRM UNDERTOOK A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF INDUSTRY RISK

CORRELATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM DEVELOPED A NEW INDUSTRY STRUCTURE,

INTENDED TO PROVIDE STRONGER LINKAGES BETWEEN EXPOSURES WITH COMMON RISK

ATTRIBUTES. THE FIRM EXPECTS THESE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE

INDUSTRY RISKS CONSISTENTLY ACROSS REGIONS AND LINES OF BUSINESS. THE

IMPLEMENTATION

OF THE NEW INDUSTRY STRUCTURE RESULTED IN SHIFTS IN CREDIT EXPOSURE, WITH

INCREASES IN SOME INDUSTRIES DUE TO CONSOLIDATION AND DECREASES IN OTHERS AS A

RESULT OF REALIGNMENTS. IN MANAGING INDUSTRY RISK, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES

CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE INDUSTRY AFFILIATIONS IN EACH INDUSTRY CATEGORY.

HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING TABLE RANKS EXPOSURES ONLY BY A CUSTOMERS PRIMARY

INDUSTRY AFFILIATION TO PREVENT DOUBLE COUNTING.

BASED ON THE 2003 DETERMINATION OF TOP 10 INDUSTRIES.

SELECTED INDUSTRY DISCUSSION

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS

SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE AND WHICH IT CONTINUES TO

MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS.



COMMERCIAL BANKS.

THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS

COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE, AND 96% OF THE CREDIT EXPOSURE IS RATED

INVESTMENT-GRADE. COLLATERAL HELD AGAINST $33.3 BILLION IN DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES IS VALUED AT $24.7 BILLION.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS



UTILITIES.

THE FIRM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

THIS SEGMENT OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, FROM $17.7 BILLION TO $15.3

BILLION, A 14% DECLINE. THIS REDUCTION WAS ACHIEVED BY SIGNIFICANT

REFINANCING ACTIVITY IN NONBANK CAPITAL MARKETS, RESTRUCTURINGS IN THE

INDUSTRY AND A DECLINE IN CLIENT DEMAND FOR LENDING ACTIVITY.

CRITICIZED CREDIT EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO U.S. CUSTOMERS, WERE

REDUCED BY 65%, TO $998 MILLION. UTILITIES BECAME A TOP-10 INDUSTRY AS

A RESULT OF THE NEW INDUSTRY STRUCTURE, WHICH CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL

RELATED SECTORS.



MEDIA.

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE DECLINED BY 20% TO $14.1 BILLION. THE

QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS ENHANCED BY A REDUCTION IN CRITICIZED

EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN THE EUROPEAN CABLE SECTOR, WHICH INCREASED THE

PROPORTION OF INVESTMENT-GRADE EXPOSURES FROM 58% TO 65% OF THE

PORTFOLIO. OVERALL, CRITICIZED EXPOSURES WERE REDUCED BY 36%, TO $1.7

BILLION. MEDIA BECAME A TOP-10 INDUSTRY AS A RESULT OF THE NEW INDUSTRY

STRUCTURE, WHICH CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL RELATED SECTORS.



TELECOM SERVICES.

IN 2003, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY

WORLDWIDE IMPROVED ITS FINANCIAL PICTURE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER SEVERE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS IN 2002. OVERALL, CREDIT EXPOSURES

DECLINED BY 30% TO $10.9 BILLION DURING THE YEAR; 75% OF THE CREDIT

EXPOSURE IS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT-GRADE COMPARED WITH 59% IN 2002.

CRITICIZED EXPOSURES WERE REDUCED BY 59% DURING THE YEAR, THE RESULT OF

CAPITAL MARKETS REFINANCINGS, OTHER RESTRUCTURINGS AND ACQUISITIONS OF

WEAKER MARKET PARTICIPANTS BY STRONGER COMPANIES.



AUTOMOTIVE.

IN 2003, AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES ACCESSED NONBANK CAPITAL

MARKETS, REDUCING THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE BY $924 MILLION. WHILE

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY IS SIGNIFICANT, MORE THAN HALF

OF THE EXPOSURE IS UNDRAWN. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, 76% OF THIS PORTFOLIO

WAS RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE, AN INCREASE FROM 2002.



ALL OTHER.

ALL OTHER AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED $180 BILLION OF

CREDIT EXPOSURE TO 21 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED TO

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES AND HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS TOTALED 38% OF

THIS CATEGORY. SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING

(GENERALLY BACKED BY RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR BONDS) ORIGINATED BY

COMPANIES IN A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES WHICH ARE NOT HIGHLY

CORRELATED. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL DIVERSIFIED ACROSS

OTHER INDUSTRIES, NONE OF WHICH COMPRISE MORE THAN 3% OF TOTAL

EXPOSURE.

COMMERCIAL CRITICIZED EXPOSURE

EXPOSURES DEEMED CRITICIZED GENERALLY REPRESENT A RATINGS PROFILE SIMILAR TO A

RATING OF CCC+/CAA1 AND LOWER, AS DEFINED BY STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS. AS OF

YEAR-END 2003, THE TOTAL $8.9 BILLION IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE REPRESENTED 2% OF

TOTAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND WAS DOWN $7.7 BILLION, OR 47%, FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE WAS DUE TO IMPROVED ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS AND CAPITAL MARKETS REFINANCINGS DURING THE YEAR, IN

PARTICULAR IN THE TELECOM SERVICES, MEDIA AND UTILITIES INDUSTRIES.

DURING THE YEAR, FROM $688 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, TO $609 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE REDUCTION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MATURATION OF $50

MILLION OF DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING AND REPAYMENTS ON SECURED EXPOSURES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, SECURED EXPOSURE OF $270 MILLION IS PERFORMING AND IS

REPORTED ON AN AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS FOR

MEASURING AND MANAGING ITS COUNTRY

EXPOSURES AND RISK. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY

INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING,

TRADING AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER

CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. IN

ADDITION TO MONITORING COUNTRY EXPOSURES,

THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE AND

MANAGE THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS ASSOCIATED

WITH SOVEREIGN CRISES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FIRMS

EXPOSURE TO SELECTED COUNTRIES. THE

SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED ON THE

MATERIALITY OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURE AND ITS

VIEW OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY ADVERSE

CREDIT CONDITIONS. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS ARE

ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G.,

GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED

BY THIRD PARTIES LOCATED OUTSIDE THE

COUNTRY IF THE ENHANCEMENTS FULLY COVER

THE COUNTRY RISK, AS WELL AS THE

COMMERCIAL RISK. IN

ADDITION, THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL,

CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES AND OTHER SHORT

CREDIT OR EQUITY TRADING POSITIONS ARE

REFLECTED. TOTAL EXPOSURE INCLUDES

EXPOSURE TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AND

PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY.

THE SLIGHT DECREASE IN EXPOSURE TO BRAZIL

OVER THE PRIOR YEAR-END WAS DUE TO

REDUCTIONS IN LOANS. THE DECLINE IN

MEXICAN EXPOSURE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN

MATURITIES AND REDUCTIONS IN COUNTERPARTY

EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVES. THE REDUCTION IN

SOUTH KOREA WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF

LOAN MATURITIES AND TRADING ACTIVITIES.

HONG KONGS EXPOSURE DECLINED DUE TO LOWER

COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON

DERIVATIVES. THE INCREASE IN RUSSIAN

EXPOSURE WAS DUE TO CROSS-BORDER AND LOCAL

TRADING POSITIONS AND SHORT-TERM LENDING.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM

UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET

THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, TO GENERATE

REVENUES THROUGH TRADING ACTIVITIES, TO

MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER

MARKETS AND TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT RISK.

THE FIRM USES THE SAME CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES TO ASSESS AND

APPROVE POTENTIAL CREDIT

EXPOSURES WHEN ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS AS THOSE USED FOR

TRADITIONAL LENDING.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE

AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND THE

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE $34 TRILLION OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL OF

THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE POSSIBLE CREDIT

LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SUCH

TRANSACTIONS. FOR MOST DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE HANDS; IT IS SIMPLY

USED AS A REFERENCE TO CALCULATE PAYMENTS.

IN TERMS OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE,

THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RISK IS THE MTM

VALUE OF THE CONTRACT. THE MTM EXPOSURE

REPRESENTS THE COST TO REPLACE THE

CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD

THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WHEN JPMORGAN

CHASE HAS MORE THAN ONE TRANSACTION

OUTSTANDING WITH A COUNTERPARTY, AND A

LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING

AGREEMENT EXISTS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY,

THE MTM EXPOSURE, LESS COLLATERAL HELD,

REPRESENTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE

APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK

WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AS OF THE REPORTING

DATE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE MTM VALUE

OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES (AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS) WAS

$84 BILLION. FURTHER, AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT $36 BILLION OF COLLATERAL HELD BY

THE FIRM, THE NET CURRENT MTM CREDIT

EXPOSURE WAS $48 BILLION.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DOES NOT CAPTURE

THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT

CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE,

THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A

CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE MEASURES OF

POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT

LOSS.

PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT

(DRE) AND

AVERAGE EXPOSURE

(AVG).

THIS LAST MEASURE IS USED AS THE BASIS

FOR THE FIRMS ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE

AS DEFINED ON PAGE 53 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE

NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN

EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE

CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT

RISK EMBEDDED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES

PORTFOLIO IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL

PEAK CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE,

AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, CREDIT RISK IS

REDUCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN OFFSETTING

TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH SEPARATE

COUNTERPARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO TRADES

CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS EVEN IF BOTH

COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO DEFAULT

SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIRM REFERS TO THIS

EFFECT AS MARKET DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE

MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK

(MDP) MEASURE IS

A PORTFOLIO AGGREGATION OF COUNTERPARTY

PEAK MEASURES, REPRESENTING THE MAXIMUM

LOSSES AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT

WOULD OCCUR IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES

DEFAULTED UNDER ANY ONE GIVEN MARKET

SCENARIO AND TIMEFRAME.

DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT EXPOSURE IS A

MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISKINESS OF

DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO

BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISKINESS OF LOAN

EXPOSURES. THIS IS DONE BY EQUATING THE

UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH

THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS

IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT

RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME

MEASURE OF THE POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN

PEAK, AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY

THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 53 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT, AVERAGE EXPOSURE IS A

MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE

TIME PERIODS. THE THREE-YEAR AVERAGE OF

THE AVG IS THE BASIS OF THE FIRMS

ECONOMIC CREDIT EXPOSURE, WHILE AVG

EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE

PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND

IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND

THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA).

THE CHART BELOW SHOWS THE EXPOSURE

PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10

YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE MDP, DRE AND

AVG METRICS. ALL THREE MEASURES GENERALLY

SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST

YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE

PORTFOLIO.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

COUNTERPARTIES. THIS IS CALLED CVA AND WAS

$635 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRMS AVG

TO A COUNTERPARTY, AND ON THE

COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY

COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT

SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND

CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET

ENVIRONMENT. THE CVA DECREASE IN 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN

CREDIT SPREADS DURING THE YEAR. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF CVA ON TRADING

REVENUE, SEE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY

ON PAGES 60-61 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK

MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING

THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE

DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM HEDGES

ITS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY

ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS.

TRANSACTIONS; THIS COLLATERAL SECURES

EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE IN THE EXISTING

PORTFOLIO OF DERIVATIVES SHOULD THE MTM OF

THE CLIENTS TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE

FIRMS FAVOR. THE $36 BILLION ALSO

EXCLUDES CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM

OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY

RECEIVABLES.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF

COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES.

THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES

TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS INCREASED TO 78% ON DECEMBER

31, 2003, FROM 67% ON DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE INCREASE OF COLLATERALIZED

TRANSACTIONS WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY NEW

COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS. THE FIRM HELD $36

BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, COMPARED WITH $30 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE FIRM POSTED $27

BILLION OF COLLATERAL AT YEAR-END 2003,

COMPARED WITH $19 BILLION AT THE END OF

2002.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE

BOTH THE FIRM AND THE COUNTERPARTY, UPON

SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE

CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST COLLATERAL FOR THE

BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. THE IMPACT ON

REQUIRED COLLATERAL OF A SINGLE-NOTCH

RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,

FROM ITS CURRENT RATING OF AA- TO A+,

WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADDITIONAL $1.3 BILLION

OF COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE

IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (FROM AA- TO BBB-)

WOULD HAVE BEEN $3.7 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003. THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL

REQUIRED UPON DOWNGRADE MOVES IN TANDEM

WITH THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO AND RANGED (WITH

RESPECT TO A SIX-NOTCH DOWNGRADE) FROM

$3.4 BILLION TO $4.2 BILLION THROUGHOUT

2003, AS THE LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES

MANAGES ITS COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE

THROUGH LOAN SALES. DURING 2003, THE FIRM SOLD

$5.2 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, OF

WHICH $1.3 BILLION WAS CRITICIZED.

THE 2003 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY

RESULTED IN $191 MILLION OF LOSSES

INCLUDED IN TRADING REVENUE. THESE LOSSES

INCLUDED $746 MILLION RELATED TO CREDIT

DERIVATIVES THAT WERE USED TO HEDGE THE

FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY $504 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED

WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE

ACCRUAL LENDING ACTIVITIES AND THE

REMAINDER PRIMARILY HEDGED THE CREDIT RISK

OF MTM DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THE LOSSES

WERE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY AN OVERALL GLOBAL

TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS. THE $746

MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO A NET LOSS

OF $119 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER.

DEALER/CLIENT ACTIVITY

JPMORGAN CHASES DEALER ACTIVITY IN CREDIT

DERIVATIVES IS CLIENT-DRIVEN. THE BUSINESS

ACTS AS A MARKET-MAKER IN SINGLE-NAME

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND ALSO STRUCTURES

MORE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS FOR CLIENTS

INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES TRADING FUNCTION

OPERATES WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK AS

OTHER MARKET-MAKING DESKS. RISK LIMITS ARE

ESTABLISHED AND CLOSELY MONITORED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE TOTAL

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF PROTECTION PURCHASED

AND SOLD BY THE DEALER BUSINESS WERE $264

BILLION AND $276 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THESE NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRM

SELLING PROTECTION ON LARGE, DIVERSIFIED,

PREDOMINANTLY INVESTMENT-GRADE PORTFOLIOS

(INCLUDING THE MOST SENIOR TRANCHES) AND

THEN HEDGING THESE POSITIONS BY BUYING

PROTECTION ON THE MORE SUBORDINATED

TRANCHES OF THE SAME PORTFOLIOS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY USE SECURITIES TO

HEDGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE THERE IS A MISMATCH IN

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES,

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE RISK POSITIONS ARE

LARGELY MATCHED.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FIRMS MANAGED CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO

TOTALED $171.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, AN INCREASE OF 10% FROM 2002.

CONSUMER LENDINGRELATED COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO

CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF 14 FAMILY

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARDS AND

AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS. THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO IS PREDOMINANTLY U.S.-BASED. THE

FOLLOWING PIE GRAPH PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO BY LOAN TYPE AT

YEAR-END 2003 AND EACH LOAN TYPES NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE.

THE FIRMS LARGEST COMPONENT, 14 FAMILY

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS PRIMARILY

SECURED BY FIRST MORTGAGES, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

COMPRISED 43% OF THE TOTAL CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO. THE RISK OF THESE LOANS IS THE

PROBABILITY THE CONSUMER WILL DEFAULT AND

THAT THE VALUE OF THE HOME WILL BE

INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MORTGAGE PLUS

CARRYING COSTS. MORTGAGE LOANS FOR 14

FAMILY RESIDENCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

INCREASED BY 10% COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR

TO $54.5 BILLION. HOME EQUITY LOANS AND

HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED $19.3

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AN INCREASE

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

OF $4.6 BILLION, OR 31%, FROM 2002. THESE

LOANS AND LINES ARE SECURED BY FIRST AND

SECOND MORTGAGES. THE RISKS ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE OF FIRST MORTGAGES; HOWEVER, LOSS

SEVERITY CAN INCREASE WHEN THE FIRM IS IN A

SECOND-LIEN POSITION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, 88% OF HOME EQUITY LOANS AND LINES OF

CREDIT WERE SECURED BY SECOND LIENS.

BORROWERS WITH HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT

ARE APPROVED FOR A LINE OF CREDIT FOR UP TO

10 YEARS. THE FIRM HAS A FUTURE FUNDING

LIABILITY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE BORROWER

DOES NOT MAKE USE OF THE LINE OF CREDIT

IMMEDIATELY BUT HAS THE RIGHT TO DRAW DOWN

THE COMMITMENT AT ANY TIME. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003, OUTSTANDINGS UNDER HOME EQUITY

LINES WERE $16.6 BILLION AND

UNUSED COMMITMENTS WERE $23.4 BILLION

(INCLUDED IN THE $28.8 BILLION OF 14

FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS). THE BUSINESS ACTIVELY MANAGES

THE UNUSED PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND

FREEZES A COMMITMENT WHEN THE BORROWER

BECOMES DELINQUENT. THESE ACCOUNTS ARE THEN

SUBJECT TO PROACTIVE DEFAULT MANAGEMENT,

WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING POTENTIAL

LOSSES.

THE FIRM ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH

INCLUDES CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THOSE THAT

HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED. CREDIT CARD

CUSTOMERS ARE INITIALLY APPROVED FOR A

SPECIFIC REVOLVING CREDIT LINE. FOR OPEN

ACCOUNTS (THOSE IN GOOD STANDING AND ABLE

TO TRANSACT), THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

APPROVED LINE AND THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING

IN THE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT IS REFERRED TO

AS OPEN-TO-BUY. THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO

CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMERS CREDIT STANDING

AND THEREFORE MUST CALCULATE THE AGGREGATE

SIZE OF THIS UNUSED EXPOSURE AND MANAGE

THE POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK. THE SIZE OF THE

CREDIT LINE AND RESULTING OPEN-TO-BUY

BALANCE IS ADJUSTED BY THE FIRM BASED ON

THE BORROWERS PAYMENT AND GENERAL CREDIT

PERFORMANCE. MANAGED CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES INCREASED BY $1.3 BILLION, OR

2%, DURING 2003. THE MANAGED NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE OF 5.87% WAS UNCHANGED

FROM 2002.

AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS GREW BY 15% TO

APPROXIMATELY $38.7 BILLION, WHILE THE NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE IMPROVED FROM 0.57% IN

2002 TO 0.45% IN 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS DECREASED BY $1.7

BILLION, OR 35%, DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003, TO $3.1 BILLION. THE

DECREASE WAS DUE TO ACTIVITY IN THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO: TOTAL REDUCTIONS,

INCLUDING REPAYMENTS, LOAN SALES AND NET

CHARGE-OFFS EXCEEDED NEW ADDITIONS,

RESULTING IN NET REDUCTIONS OF $1.7

BILLION. BY CONTRAST, THERE WERE

COMMERCIAL NET ADDITIONS DURING 2002. A

DECLINE IN EXPOSURE TO THE TELECOM

SERVICES, UTILITIES AND MEDIA INDUSTRIES

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE

OVERALL $1.7 BILLION DECREASE.

COMMERCIAL

COMMERCIAL NONPERFORMING LOANS DECREASED

BY 45%, TO $2.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003, FROM $3.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END

2002. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, NONPERFORMING

COMMERCIAL LOANS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

COMMERCIAL LOANS FELL TO 2.42% FROM

4.01%. COMMERCIAL LOAN NET CHARGE-OFFS IN

2003 WERE $816 MILLION, COMPARED WITH

$1.9 BILLION IN 2002, THE RESULT OF

IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY IN THE PORTFOLIO

AND INCREASED RECOVERIES RESULTING FROM

RESTRUCTURINGS. THERE WERE NO NET

CHARGE-OFFS OF COMMERCIAL LENDINGRELATED

COMMITMENTS IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $212

MILLION IN 2002. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS

IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, TO 0.91% IN 2003

FROM 1.93% IN 2002.

COMMERCIAL NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2004 ARE

EXPECTED TO DECLINE, BUT AT A SLOWER

PACE THAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003.

CONSUMER

THE $21 MILLION DECREASE IN CONSUMER

NONPERFORMING LOANS REFLECTED IMPROVED

CREDIT QUALITY IN THE PORTFOLIO. WHILE NET

CHARGE-OFFS INCREASED BY $92 MILLION

DURING THE YEAR REFLECTING A 10% GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO, THE AVERAGE ANNUAL NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE DECLINED TO 1.96% FROM

2.30% DURING 2002.

IN 2004, THE AMOUNT OF GROSS CHARGE-OFFS

IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO GROWTH IN

OUTSTANDINGS, BUT NET CHARGE-OFF RATES ARE

EXPECTED TO REMAIN STABLE.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE

CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING LOSSES WHERE THE

ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR

THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN

DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE FIRMS

RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATIVE TO

THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED BASED ON THAT

REVIEW IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT,

CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE

INCLUDES SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS

COMPONENTS AND A RESIDUAL COMPONENT. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE

FIRM ON PAGES 7576 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGE

100 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOANS

THE COMMERCIAL SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT

OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $917 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, A DECREASE OF 43%

FROM YEAR-END 2002. THE DECREASE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMMERCIAL LOAN

PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS THE REDUCTION IN

THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE COMMERCIAL EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF

THE ALLOWANCE WAS $454 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, A DECREASE OF 26% FROM YEAR-END

2002. THE DECREASE REFLECTED AN

IMPROVEMENT IN THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF THE

LOAN PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS THE IMPROVING

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, WHICH AFFECTED INPUTS

TO THE EXPECTED LOSS MODEL.

THE CONSUMER EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF

THE ALLOWANCE WAS $2.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, A DECREASE OF 4% FROM YEAR-END

2002. ALTHOUGH THE CONSUMER MANAGED LOAN

PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY 10%, THE BUSINESSES

THAT DROVE THE INCREASE, HOME FINANCE AND

AUTO FINANCE, HAVE COLLATERALIZED PRODUCTS

WITH LOWER EXPECTED LOSS RATES.

THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE

WAS $895 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT, WHICH

INCORPORATES MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT,

ADDRESSES UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED IN THE FORMULA-BASED

COMMERCIAL SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED

COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES.

THE $121 MILLION INCREASE ADDRESSED

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

AND CONCENTRATIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL LOAN

PORTFOLIO THAT EXISTED DURING THE FIRST

HALF OF 2003. IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR, AS COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY

CONTINUED TO IMPROVE AND THE COMMERCIAL

ALLOWANCE DECLINED FURTHER, THE RESIDUAL

COMPONENT WAS REDUCED AS WELL. AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE TOTAL

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WITHIN THE

FIRMS TARGET RANGE OF BETWEEN 10% AND

20%. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT IF THE

CURRENT POSITIVE TREND IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUES,

THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDUAL COMPONENTS

WILL CONTINUE TO BE REDUCED.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT

IN THE CREDIT-EXTENSION PROCESS,

MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES SPECIFIC AND

EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS AS WELL AS A

RESIDUAL COMPONENT FOR COMMERCIAL

LENDINGRELATED COMMITMENTS. THIS IS

COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO

THAT USED FOR THE COMMERCIAL LOAN

PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED

MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

THE ALLOWANCE DECREASED BY 11% TO $324

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, DUE TO

IMPROVEMENT IN THE CRITICIZED PORTION OF

THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THERE ARE ALSO GROUPS THAT REPORT TO THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH SOME

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MARKET RISK-RELATED

ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE

FINANCE AREA, THE VALUATION CONTROL

FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE

ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF POSITIONS

THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET

RISK ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES.

TRADING RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS HELD AS

PART OF A BUSINESS WHOSE STRATEGY IS TO

TRADE, MAKE MARKETS OR TAKE POSITIONS FOR

THE FIRMS OWN TRADING ACCOUNT; GAINS AND

LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE REPORTED IN

TRADING REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK INCLUDES

MORTGAGE BANKING POSITIONS HELD FOR

LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT AND POSITIONS USED

TO MANAGE THE FIRMS ASSET/LIABILITY

EXPOSURES. IN MOST CASES, UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE

GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED IN NET INCOME OR

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISKS

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL

ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES

SEVERAL MEASURES, BOTH STATISTICAL AND

NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



STATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

-

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)

-

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

-

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS

-

NET INTEREST INCOME STRESS TESTS

-

OTHER MEASURES OF POSITION SIZE AND SENSITIVITY TO MARKET MOVES

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE,

VAR, GAUGES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM

ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES A CONSISTENT

CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF

RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF RISK

DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED TO COMPARE

RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES, TO MONITOR LIMITS

AND TO ALLOCATE ECONOMIC CAPITAL TO THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. VAR PROVIDES RISK

TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING

ENVIRONMENT.

EACH BUSINESS DAY, THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A

COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT

INCLUDES BOTH TRADING AND NONTRADING

ACTIVITIES. JPMORGAN CHASES VAR

CALCULATION IS HIGHLY GRANULAR, COMPRISING

MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION POSITIONS AND

240,000 PRICING SERIES (E.G., SECURITIES

PRICES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES). FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS

EXPOSURE, THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED

FULL-REVALUATION VAR, WHICH, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES, GENERATES THE MOST ACCURATE

RESULTS.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES

HISTORICAL SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES

RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND PORTFOLIOS IN

A CONSISTENT, COMPARABLE WAY. THIS

APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES

IN MARKET VALUE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

FUTURE CHANGES. THE SIMULATION IS BASED

ON MARKET DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12

MONTHS.

THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR USING A ONE-DAY

TIME HORIZON AND A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

THIS MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO

INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED

BY VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN EVERY 100

TRADING DAYS, OR ABOUT 2.5 TIMES A YEAR.

ALL STATISTICAL MODELS INVOLVE A DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY, DEPENDING ON THE ASSUMPTIONS

THEY EMPLOY. THE FIRM PREFERS HISTORICAL

SIMULATION, BECAUSE IT INVOLVES FEWER

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF

PORTFOLIO LOSSES THAN PARAMETER-BASED

METHODOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

REGULARLY ASSESSES THE QUALITY OF THE

MARKET DATA, SINCE THEIR ACCURACY IS

CRITICAL TO COMPUTING VAR. NEVERTHELESS,

BECAUSE VAR IS BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET

DATA, IT MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT FUTURE

RISK DURING ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH MARKET

VOLATILITY IS CHANGING. IN ADDITION, THE

VAR MEASURE ON ANY PARTICULAR DAY MAY NOT

BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RISK LEVELS, SINCE

POSITIONS AND MARKET CONDITIONS MAY BOTH

CHANGE OVER TIME.

WHILE VAR IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR

EVALUATING RELATIVE RISKS AND AGGREGATING

RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES, IT ONLY MEASURES

THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF DAILY

REVENUES. PROFITABILITY AND RISK LEVELS

OVER LONGER TIME PERIODS  A FISCAL

QUARTER OR A YEAR  MAY BE ONLY LOOSELY

RELATED TO THE AVERAGE VALUE OF VAR OVER

THOSE PERIODS. FIRST, WHILE VAR MEASURES

POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS AROUND AVERAGE

DAILY REVENUE, THE AVERAGE ITSELF COULD

REFLECT SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES; FOR

EXAMPLE, FROM CLIENT REVENUES THAT

ACCOMPANY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. SECOND,

LARGE TRADING REVENUES MAY RESULT FROM

POSITIONS TAKEN OVER LONGER PERIODS OF

TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, A BUSINESS MAY MAINTAIN

AN EXPOSURE TO RISING OR FALLING INTEREST

RATES OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS OR MONTHS. IF

THE MARKET EXHIBITS A LONG-TERM TREND OVER

THAT TIME, THE BUSINESS COULD EXPERIENCE

LARGE GAINS OR LOSSES, EVEN THOUGH REVENUE

VOLATILITY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL DAY MAY HAVE

BEEN SMALL.

VAR BACKTESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR

MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACKTESTING

OF VAR AGAINST ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS,

BASED ON DAILY MARKET RISKRELATED

REVENUE. MARKET RISKRELATED REVENUE IS

DEFINED AS THE DAILY CHANGE IN VALUE OF

THE MARK-TO-MARKET TRADING PORTFOLIOS PLUS

ANY TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME,

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES

OR OTHER REVENUE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF

MARKET RISKRELATED REVENUE IS CONSISTENT

WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEES

MARKET RISK CAPITAL RULES. THE HISTOGRAM

BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE FIRMS

DAILY MARKET RISKRELATED REVENUE FOR

TRADING BUSINESSES FOR 2003. THE CHART

SHOWS THAT THE FIRM POSTED POSITIVE DAILY

MARKET RISKRELATED REVENUE ON 235 OUT OF

260 DAYS IN 2003, WITH 170 DAYS EXCEEDING

$25 MILLION. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 25

DAYS; NINE OF THOSE DAYS WERE IN THE THIRD

QUARTER, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY POOR OVERALL

TRADING RESULTS. THE LARGEST DAILY TRADING

LOSS DURING THE YEAR WAS $100 MILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE INSET IN THE HISTOGRAM EXAMINES THE 25

DAYS ON WHICH THE FIRM POSTED TRADING

LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR

WAS GREATER THAN THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH

DAY. THERE WAS ONE DAY ON WHICH TRADING

LOSSES EXCEEDED VAR BY APPROXIMATELY 10%,

A PERFORMANCE STATISTICALLY CONSISTENT

WITH THE FIRMS 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, THERE WAS AN

ADDITIONAL DAY

ON WHICH THE FIRMS LOSSES EXCEEDED VAR;

THESE LOSSES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CERTAIN POSITIONS IN THE MORTGAGE

BANKING BUSINESS, WHICH WERE THEN

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS TRADING

PORTFOLIO, BUT WHICH ARE NOW INCLUDED IN

THE NONTRADING PORTFOLIO WITH OTHER

MORTGAGE BANKING POSITIONS.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO

UNLIKELY EVENTS IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS

TESTING CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO

UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL

MARKETS. STRESS TESTING IS EQUALLY

IMPORTANT AS VAR IN MEASURING AND

CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES

THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK

PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL AND IS USED FOR

MONITORING LIMITS, CROSS-BUSINESS RISK

MEASUREMENT AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL

ALLOCATION.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS MEASURE THE

POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE

FIRMS PORTFOLIOS. APPLYING ECONOMIC-VALUE

STRESS TESTS HELPS THE FIRM UNDERSTAND HOW

THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS BALANCE SHEET

(NOT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER GAAP)

WOULD CHANGE UNDER CERTAIN SCENARIOS. THE

FIRM CONDUCTS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS

FOR BOTH ITS TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING

ACTIVITIES, USING THE SAME SCENARIOS FOR

BOTH.

THE FIRM STRESS TESTS ITS PORTFOLIOS AT

LEAST ONCE A MONTH USING MULTIPLE

SCENARIOS. SEVERAL MACROECONOMIC

EVENT-RELATED SCENARIOS ARE EVALUATED

ACROSS THE FIRM, WITH SHOCKS TO ROUGHLY

10,000 MARKET

PRICES SPECIFIED FOR EACH SCENARIO.

ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS

PREDOMINANT IN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS AND INCLUDE SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS

ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE MOVES IN

COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS.

SCENARIOS ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND

UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE FIRMS

RISK PROFILE AND ECONOMIC EVENTS.

STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND

EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED EACH MONTH TO

THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE

LINES OF BUSINESS, TO HELP THEM BETTER

MEASURE AND MANAGE RISKS AND TO UNDERSTAND

EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

THE FIRMS STRESS-TEST METHODOLOGY ASSUMES

THAT, DURING AN ACTUAL STRESS EVENT, NO

MANAGEMENT ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN TO CHANGE

THE RISK PROFILE OF PORTFOLIOS. THIS

ASSUMPTION CAPTURES THE DECREASED

LIQUIDITY THAT OFTEN OCCURS WITH ABNORMAL

MARKETS AND RESULTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW,

IN A CONSERVATIVE STRESS-TEST RESULT.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT VAR RESULTS

CANNOT BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO

STRESS-TEST LOSS RESULTS FOR THREE

REASONS. FIRST, STRESS-TEST LOSSES ARE

CALCULATED AT VARYING DATES EACH MONTH,

WHILE VAR IS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERFORMED DAILY AND DISCLOSED AT THE

PERIOD-END DATE. SECOND, VAR AND STRESS

TESTS ARE TWO DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS

YIELDING VERY DIFFERENT LOSS POTENTIALS.

THUS, ALTHOUGH THE SAME TRADING PORTFOLIOS

ARE USED FOR BOTH TESTS, VAR IS BASED ON A

DISTRIBUTION OF ONE-DAY HISTORICAL LOSSES

MEASURED OVER THE MOST RECENT ONE YEAR; BY

CONTRAST, STRESS TESTING SUBJECTS THE

PORTFOLIO TO MORE EXTREME, LARGER MOVES

OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON (E.G., 2-3

WEEKS). THIRD, AS VAR AND STRESS TESTS ARE

DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS, THE IMPACT OF

PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION CAN VARY

GREATLY. FOR VAR, MARKETS CAN CHANGE IN

PATTERNS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON,

MOVING FROM HIGHLY CORRELATED TO LESS SO;

IN STRESS TESTING, THE FOCUS IS ON A

SINGLE EVENT AND THE ASSOCIATED

CORRELATIONS IN AN EXTREME MARKET

SITUATION. AS A RESULT, WHILE VAR OVER A

GIVEN TIME HORIZON CAN BE LOWERED BY A

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT IN THE PORTFOLIO,

THIS BENEFIT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

MANIFEST ITSELF IN STRESS-TEST SCENARIOS,

WHICH ASSUME LARGE, COHERENT MOVES ACROSS

ALL MARKETS.

NET INTEREST INCOME STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED

ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC

SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO

CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET

INCOME IS ALSO CRITICAL. THE FIRM CONDUCTS

SIMULATIONS OF NET INTEREST INCOME FOR ITS

NONTRADING ACTIVITIES UNDER A VARIETY OF

INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE SCENARIOS USED FOR

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING.

NET INTEREST INCOME STRESS TESTS MEASURE

THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FIRMS NII

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THESE STRESS

TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS

INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS

RATES

(E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING

STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS AND CHANGES IN

PRODUCT MIX. THESE STRESS TESTS ALSO TAKE

INTO ACCOUNT FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET

CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES AND

SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT

AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

RIFLE

IN ADDITION TO VAR, JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYS

THE RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE

EXPOSURES (RIFLE) METHODOLOGY AS ANOTHER

STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE. THE FIRM

REQUIRES THAT ALL MARKET RISK

-

TAKING

BUSINESSES SELF-ASSESS THEIR RISKS TO

UNUSUAL AND SPECIFIC EVENTS. INDIVIDUALS

WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY

COMPLEX POSITIONS, IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

WORST-CASE LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM AN

UNUSUAL OR SPECIFIC EVENT, SUCH AS A

POTENTIAL TAX CHANGE, AND ESTIMATE THE

PROBABILITIES OF SUCH LOSSES. THROUGH THE

FIRMS RIFLE SYSTEM, THIS INFORMATION IS

THEN DIRECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF

MANAGEMENT, THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO

IDENTIFY FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITIES

NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY VAR AND STRESS

TESTING.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN

STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS,

BASIS POINT VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES,

POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION

TURNOVER. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AN EXPOSURES

SIZE AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS

MOVING. NONSTATISTICAL MEASURES ARE USED

FOR MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS

AND TACTICAL CONTROLS.

TRADING RISK

MAJOR RISKS

INTEREST RATES.

INTEREST RATE RISK (WHICH

INCLUDES CREDIT SPREAD RISK) INVOLVES THE

POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES

IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN CHANGES TO NII, SECURITIES VALUATIONS,

AND OTHER INTEREST-SENSITIVE REVENUES AND

EXPENSES.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES.

THESE RISKS INVOLVE THE POTENTIAL DECLINE

IN NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

EQUITIES OR COMMODITIES MARKETS, WHETHER

DUE TO PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE

FIRM, OR

DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF CLIENT

ACTIVITY.

HEDGE FUND INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM INVESTS IN

NUMEROUS HEDGE FUNDS THAT HAVE VARIOUS

STRATEGIC GOALS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES,

INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, PORTFOLIO SIZES

AND MANAGEMENT STYLES. FUND INVESTMENTS ARE

PASSIVE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. INDIVIDUAL

HEDGE FUNDS MAY HAVE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND

COMMODITY RISK WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIO RISK

STRUCTURES.

TRADING VAR

THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO TRADING VAR WAS

INTEREST RATE RISK. BEFORE PORTFOLIO

DIVERSIFICATION, INTEREST RATE RISK

ACCOUNTED FOR ROUGHLY 60% OF THE AVERAGE

TRADING PORTFOLIO VAR. THE DIVERSIFICATION

EFFECT, WHICH ON AVERAGE REDUCED THE DAILY

AVERAGE TRADING PORTFOLIO VAR BY $38

MILLION IN 2003, REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE

LARGEST LOSSES FOR DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND

RISKS DO NOT TYPICALLY OCCUR AT THE SAME

TIME. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS

IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF

THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES. THE

DEGREE OF DIVERSIFICATION IS DETERMINED

BOTH BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT

MARKET VARIABLES TEND TO MOVE TOGETHER, AND

BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT BUSINESSES

HAVE SIMILAR POSITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN YEAR-END VAR WAS DRIVEN BY

AN INCREASE IN THE VAR FOR EQUITIES RISK,

WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN CUSTOMER-DRIVEN BUSINESS IN

EQUITY OPTIONS. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE

OF A YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY AS TRADING POSITIONS CHANGE

AND MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES.

THE POTENTIAL STRESS-TEST LOSS AS OF

DECEMBER 4, 2003, IS THE RESULT OF THE

EQUITY MARKET COLLAPSE STRESS SCENARIO,

WHICH IS BROADLY MODELED ON THE EVENTS OF

OCTOBER 1987. UNDER THIS SCENARIO, GLOBAL

EQUITY MARKETS SUFFER A SHARP REVERSAL

AFTER A LONG SUSTAINED RALLY; EQUITY PRICES

DECLINE GLOBALLY; VOLATILITIES FOR

EQUITIES, INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT

PRODUCTS INCREASE DRAMATICALLY FOR SHORT

MATURITIES AND LESS SO FOR LONGER

MATURITIES; SOVEREIGN BOND YIELDS DECLINE

MODERATELY; AND SWAP SPREADS AND CREDIT

SPREADS WIDEN MODERATELY.

NONTRADING RISK

MAJOR RISK  INTEREST RATES

THE EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS CORE BUSINESS

STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE

DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS THE FIRM UNDERTAKES

TO RISK-MANAGE STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES GIVE

RISE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN ITS

NONTRADING ACTIVITIES.

THIS EXPOSURE CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE

TIMING BETWEEN THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF

ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE LEVEL AND SHAPE

OF INTEREST RATE CURVES MAY ALSO CREATE

INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE REPRICING

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT

NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK,

WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE REPRICING

CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO FLOATING-RATE

INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND 3-MONTH

LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE FIRMS

PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT MAY

HAVE AN IMPACT ON PRICING AND BALANCE

LEVELS.

THE FIRM MANAGES EXPOSURE IN ITS STRUCTURAL

INTEREST RATE ACTIVITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED,

CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS

TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO GLOBAL

TREASURY THROUGH A TRANSFER PRICING SYSTEM,

WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE HEDGED

IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS

INCLUDE CURRENT BALANCE AND CONTRACTUAL

RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL

PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT

EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND

MATURITIES AND RATE INDICES USED FOR

RE-PRICING. ALL TRANSFER PRICING

ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ON A SEMIANNUAL

BASIS AND MUST BE APPROVED BY THE FIRMS

CAPITAL COMMITTEE.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES ALSO

GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS.

THE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM THE FIRMS

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES IS A RESULT OF

OPTION AND BASIS RISKS. OPTION RISK ARISES

FROM PREPAYMENT FEATURES IN MORTGAGES AND

MSRS, AND FROM THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY

ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY

CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT

RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES

AND OTHER INTEREST RATES. THESE RISKS ARE

MANAGED THROUGH HEDGING PROGRAMS SPECIFIC

TO THE DIFFERENT MORTGAGE BANKING

ACTIVITIES. POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET

VALUE OF MSRS AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION

LEVELS OF MSRS ARE MANAGED VIA A RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ATTEMPTS TO OFFSET

CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF MSRS WITH

CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF DERIVATIVES

AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES. A SIMILAR

APPROACH IS IMPLEMENTED TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE AND OPTION RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE FIRMS MORTGAGE ORIGINATION

BUSINESS.

NONTRADING VAR

FOR NONTRADING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE

MARKET RISK, VAR MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE;

HOWEVER, IT IS NOT A MEASURE OF REPORTED

REVENUES, SINCE THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT

MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE, MAXIMUM AND

DECEMBER 31 NONTRADING PORTFOLIO VAR WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN

MARKET VOLATILITY DURING THE 2003 THIRD

QUARTER, AND TO THE RISE IN INTEREST RATES

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003, WHICH INCREASED

THE SENSITIVITY OF MORTGAGE INSTRUMENTS TO

THE BASIS RISK BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES AND

OTHER INTEREST RATES.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

THE FIRM CONDUCTS BOTH ECONOMIC-VALUE AND

NII STRESS TESTS ON ITS NONTRADING

THE POTENTIAL STRESS-TEST LOSS AS OF

CREDIT CRUNCH STRESS SCENARIO, WHICH IS

BROADLY BASED ON THE EVENTS OF 1997-98.

UNDER THAT SCENARIO, POLITICAL INSTABILITY

NONSTATISTICAL MEASURES

THE FIRM ALSO CALCULATES EXPOSURES TO

DIRECTIONAL INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND TO

CHANGES IN THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE SWAP

CURVE AND OTHER BASIS RISKS. AT YEAR-END,

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIRMS NONTRADING

POSITIONS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

EXPOSURE TO INCREASES OR DECREASES IN

INTEREST RATES. HOWEVER, THE FIRMS

NON-TRADING POSITIONS MAINTAIN AN EXPOSURE

TO THE SPREAD BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES AND

SWAP RATES; AT YEAR-END THE FIRM WAS

EXPOSED TO A WIDENING OF THIS SPREAD.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR MARKET RISK

THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL

GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT

CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH

RISKS ARE PRESENT IN BUSINESSES. DAILY

VAR, MONTHLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER

FACTORS DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL

CHARGES FOR MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

VAR MEASURE CAPTURES A LARGE NUMBER OF

ONE-DAY PRICE MOVES, WHILE STRESS TESTS

CAPTURE A SMALLER NUMBER OF VERY LARGE

PRICE MOVES. THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET

RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT

ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT

SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS PRIMARILY CONTROLLED THROUGH

A SERIES OF LIMITS. THE SIZES OF THE LIMITS

REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK APPETITE AFTER

EXTENSIVE ANALYSES OF THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE

ANALYSES EXAMINE FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET

VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS

TRACK RECORD, AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND

DEPTH.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS ENCOMPASS

VAR CALCULATIONS AND STRESS-TEST LOSS

ADVISORIES. SIMILARLY, BUSINESS-SEGMENT

LEVELS INCLUDE LIMITS ON VAR CALCULATIONS,

NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND P&L LOSS

ADVISORIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST

WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED

DAILY. AN EXCEEDED LIMIT IS REPORTED

IMMEDIATELY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE

AFFECTED BUSINESS UNIT MUST TAKE

APPROPRIATE ACTION TO COMPLY WITH THE

LIMIT. IF THE BUSINESS CANNOT DO THIS

WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIMEFRAME, SENIOR

MANAGEMENT IS CONSULTED ON THE APPROPRIATE

ACTION.

MRM REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK

LIMITS, AND THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND

EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK CONTROLS ARE

REVIEWED. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

MANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CANNOT BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES BUT ARE INSTEAD VALUED USING

PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE USED FOR

MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING RISK AGAINST LIMITS, AND FOR

VALUATION. THE FIRM REVIEWS THE MODELS IT

USES TO ASSESS MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND

CONSISTENCY ACROSS BUSINESSES. THE MODEL

REVIEWS CONSIDER A

NUMBER OF ISSUES: APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

MODEL, ASSESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT

ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

THE TRANSACTION AND CAPTURES ITS

SIGNIFICANT RISKS; INDEPENDENCE AND

RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES;

APPROPRIATENESS AND ADEQUACY OF NUMERICAL

ALGORITHMS; AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT

PARAMETERS OR OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WHICH

CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED FOR NEW OR CHANGED

MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED

MODELS. RE-REVIEWS ASSESS WHETHER THERE

HAVE BEEN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE

ACCEPTED MODELS; WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN

ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT

MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY; AND

WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR

COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE

REASSESSMENT OF THE MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR

A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS,

SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY

THE FIRM ON PAGES 76-77 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS

RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED

PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS, OR

EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT

ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST

ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS,

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE

BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS THAT DO

NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH

OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS

CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN FINANCIAL

LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK,

THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND A CONTROL

FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND

WELL CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT

APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS

FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT

OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS

SUBJECT.

NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES,

THE FIRM INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES. THE

FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK

MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH

LOSSES.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

THROUGHOUT 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUED

TO EXECUTE A MULTI-YEAR PLAN, BEGUN IN

2001, FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT

EMPHASIZES ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

OPERATIONAL RISK THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. THE

OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO SUPPLEMENT

THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACH TO

OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS

AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC,

CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED

FIRM-WIDE. KEY THEMES FOR THIS EFFORT ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF

KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE

RESOLUTION. ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES RESIDES WITH THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER. THE COMPONENTS ARE.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

THE GOVERNANCE

STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE

FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR

MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK RESTS WITH

BUSINESS MANAGERS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROL

PROCEDURES FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE

BUSINESSES.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE, WHICH

MEETS QUARTERLY, IS COMPOSED OF SENIOR

OPERATIONAL RISK AND FINANCE MANAGERS FROM

EACH OF THE BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, EACH

OF THE BUSINESSES MUST MAINTAIN BUSINESS

CONTROL COMMITTEES TO OVERSEE THEIR

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

IN 2003, JPMORGAN

CHASE CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS FIRM-WIDE

SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE GOAL OF THE

PROCESS WAS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY

THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS

ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH

IT MAINTAINED APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION

PLANS WERE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES

IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE TO BE HELD

ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING

THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

SELF-ASSESSMENTS WERE COMPLETED BY THE

BUSINESSES THROUGH THE USE OF HORIZON, A

SOFTWARE APPLICATION DEVELOPED BY THE

FIRM. WITH THE AID OF HORIZON, ALL

BUSINESSES WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM

SEMIANNUAL SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN 2003. GOING

FORWARD, THE FIRM WILL UTILIZE THE

SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS A DYNAMIC RISK

MANAGEMENT TOOL.

OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT MONITORING.

THE

FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR REPORTING

OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING

ANALYSES OF ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS

TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSES, PERFORMED BOTH AT A

LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK EVENT

TYPE, ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF ROOT CAUSES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL

DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL

DATA FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH

INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED WILL

ENABLE THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST AGAINST

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS.

INTEGRATED REPORTING.

THE FIRM IS

PRESENTLY DESIGNING AN OPERATIONAL RISK

ARCHITECTURE MODEL TO INTEGRATE THE ABOVE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS INTO A UNIFIED,

WEB-BASED TOOL. WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED,

THIS MODEL WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO ENHANCE

ITS REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL

RISK DATA, LEADING TO IMPROVED RISK

MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT.

IN ADDITION TO CONDUCTING

INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS, THE FIRMS

INTERNAL AUDIT GROUP PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON

THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK. THIS GUIDANCE

HAS HELPED FURTHER THE FIRM-WIDE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRAMEWORK, WHICH IN

TURN HAS LED TO A STRONGER OVERALL CONTROL

ENVIRONMENT. THE INTERNAL AUDIT GROUP

UTILIZES THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT

RESULTS TO HELP FOCUS ITS INTERNAL AUDITS

ON OPERATIONAL CONTROL ISSUES. THE GROUP

ALSO REVIEWS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND

ACCURACY OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS DURING THE CONDUCT OF ITS AUDITS.

OPERATIONAL RISK CATEGORIES

FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS AND AGGREGATION,

THE FIRM BREAKS OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS

DOWN INTO FIVE PRIMARY CATEGORIES.



CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND UNAUTHORIZED ACTIVITY



EXECUTION AND PROCESSING ERRORS



EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY



PHYSICAL ASSET AND INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE

COMPLIANCE WITH SARBANES-OXLEY SECTION 404

THE FIRM INTENDS TO USE, AS MUCH AS

POSSIBLE, ITS EXISTING CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF

SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

REGARDING INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS

OF EVALUATING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 AND OF IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES INTO

ITS EXISTING PRACTICES. THE

FIRM INTENDS TO BE IN FULL

COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

ACT WHEN THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE IN 2004.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ACT, SEE

PAGE 79 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISK

DURING 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A NEW

RISK-BASED CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY

WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS

RISK INDEPENDENTLY, ON A BOTTOMS-UP

BASIS, AND ALLOCATES CAPITAL TO EACH

COMPONENT. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW

METHODOLOGY IN 2003 RESULTED IN AN

OVERALL LOWER AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED

TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO

OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISKS.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL IS

BASED ON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL

SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO

REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE

CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND WITH A POTENTIAL

OFFSET FOR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER

PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE MODEL IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED BASEL II

ACCORD AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT EVENTUALLY

FOR QUALIFICATION UNDER THE ADVANCED

MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

BUSINESS RISK IS DEFINED AS THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH VOLATILITY IN THE FIRMS

EARNINGS DUE TO FACTORS NOT CAPTURED BY

OTHER PARTS OF ITS ECONOMIC-CAPITAL

FRAMEWORK. SUCH VOLATILITY CAN ARISE FROM

INEFFECTIVE DESIGN OR EXECUTION OF

BUSINESS STRATEGIES, VOLATILE ECONOMIC OR

FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITY, CHANGING CLIENT

EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS, AND

RESTRUCTURING TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. FOR BUSINESS

RISK, CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO EACH

BUSINESS BASED ON HISTORICAL REVENUE

VOLATILITY AND MEASURES OF FIXED AND

VARIABLE EXPENSES. EARNINGS VOLATILITY

ARISING FROM OTHER RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS

CREDIT, MARKET, OR OPERATIONAL RISK, IS

EXCLUDED FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF BUSINESS

RISK CAPITAL, AS THOSE FACTORS ARE

CAPTURED UNDER THEIR RESPECTIVE RISK

CAPITAL MODELS.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS

PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET,

OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISKS, BUT

EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE OF ITS

REPUTATION AMONG MANY CONSTITUENTS

 CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL

AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  FOR BUSINESS

PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

ATTENTION TO ITS REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS

BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES,

AND MAINTENANCE OF REPUTATION IS THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE AT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL

RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS: THE WORLDWIDE

RULES OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, POLICIES AND

OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE

TRANSACTIONS. THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS

INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE, WHICH EXAMINES

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR ROLE FOR THE

FIRM.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

(FRMC) TO OVERSEE FIDUCIARY-RELATED

RISKS THAT MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, AND THAT ARE NOT

COVERED ELSEWHERE BY THE CORPORATE RISK

MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE. THE

PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS TO ENSURE THAT A

BUSINESS, IN PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK

MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, PERFORMS

AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO

ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT, WHETHER IT

BE FIDUCIARY OR NONFIDUCIARY IN NATURE. A

PARTICULAR FOCUS OF THE FRMC IS THE

POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A

BUSINESSS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT,

INCLUDING THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT

ADDRESS CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION,

DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND PERFORMANCE

EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE

INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. IN THIS WAY, THE

FRMC PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS

EFFORTS TO MEASURE, MONITOR AND CONTROL

THE RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY

OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS,

AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ITS

FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDERTAKEN ON

BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES.

THE FIRM HAS AN ADDITIONAL STRUCTURE TO

ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON

ITS REPUTATION FROM TRANSACTIONS WITH

CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEX DERIVATIVES

AND STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS. THIS

STRUCTURE, IMPLEMENTED IN 2002, REINFORCES

THE FIRMS PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING

TRANSACTIONS IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS,

ETHICAL ISSUES AND REPUTATIONAL RISK, AND

IT INTENSIFIES THE FIRMS

SCRUTINY OF THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS

TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS POINT OF

VIEW, WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO MISLEAD

INVESTORS OR OTHERS. THE STRUCTURE

OPERATES AT THREE LEVELS: AS PART OF EVERY

BUSINESSS TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS;

THROUGH REVIEW BY REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW

COMMITTEES; AND THROUGH OVERSIGHT BY THE

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

BUSINESS TRANSACTION APPROVAL

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO

THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO

ADDRESS REPUTATION RISK LIES WITH THE

BUSINESS UNITS CONDUCTING THE TRANSACTIONS

IN QUESTION. THE FIRMS TRANSACTION

APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES REVIEW AND

SIGN-OFF FROM, AMONG OTHERS, INTERNAL

LEGAL/COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS, TAX AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUPS. TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING AN SPE ESTABLISHED BY THE FIRM

RECEIVE PARTICULAR SCRUTINY AND MUST

COMPLY WITH A SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLE

POLICY, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SUCH

ENTITY IS PROPERLY APPROVED, DOCUMENTED,

MONITORED AND CONTROLLED.

REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES

BUSINESS UNITS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT

TO REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES

PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY HEIGHTEN

REPUTATION

RISK  PARTICULARLY A CLIENTS MOTIVATION

AND ITS INTENDED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OF

THE TRANSACTION. THE COMMITTEES APPROVE,

REJECT OR REQUIRE FURTHER CLARIFICATION

ON OR CHANGES TO THE TRANSACTIONS. THE

MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE SENIOR

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS AND

SUPPORT UNITS IN THE REGION. THE

COMMITTEES MAY ESCALATE TRANSACTION

REVIEW TO THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE IS THE MOST

SENIOR APPROVAL LEVEL FOR CLIENT

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING REPUTATION RISK

ISSUES. THE MANDATE OF THE OFFICE IS TO

OPINE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS BROUGHT BY

THE REGIONAL COMMITTEES AND CONSIDER

CHANGES IN POLICIES OR PRACTICES RELATING

TO REPUTATION RISK. THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE

CONSULTS WITH THE FIRMS MOST SENIOR

EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AND PROVIDES

REGULAR UPDATES. ASIDE FROM GOVERNANCE AND

GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, THE

OBJECTIVE OF THE POLICY REVIEW PROCESS IS

TO REINFORCE A CULTURE, THROUGH A CASE

STUDY APPROACH, THAT ENSURES THAT ALL

EMPLOYEES, REGARDLESS OF SENIORITY,

UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF

REPUTATION RISK CONTROL AND CAN RECOGNIZE

AND ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

JPMP EMPLOYS PROCESSES FOR RISK

MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL OF PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR

OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM. THE

PROCESSES ARE COORDINATED WITH THE FIRMS

OVERALL APPROACH TO MARKET AND

CONCENTRATION RISK. PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS

INITIALLY MONITORED THROUGH THE USE OF

INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS.

ADDITIONALLY, TO MANAGE THE PACE OF NEW

INVESTMENTS, A CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF

ANNUAL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.

JPMPS PUBLIC EQUITY HOLDINGS CREATE A

SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO GENERAL DECLINES

IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. TO GAUGE THAT

RISK, VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES ARE

CALCULATED IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY ARE

FOR THE FIRMS TRADING AND NONTRADING

PORTFOLIOS. JPMP MANAGEMENT UNDERTAKES

FREQUENT REVIEWS OF ITS PUBLIC SECURITY

HOLDINGS AS PART OF A DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO SALES AND HEDGING ISSUES.

HEDGING PROGRAMS ARE LIMITED BUT ARE

CONSIDERED WHEN

PRACTICAL AND AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE.

OVER TIME, THE FIRM MAY CHANGE THE NATURE

AND TYPE OF HEDGES IT ENTERS INTO, AS

WELL AS CLOSE HEDGING POSITIONS

ALTOGETHER.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR PRIVATE EQUITY RISK

INTERNAL CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO JPMPS

PUBLIC EQUITIES PORTFOLIO BASED ON STRESS

SCENARIOS WHICH REFLECT THE POTENTIAL

LOSS INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO IN THE

EVENT OF A LARGE EQUITY MARKET DECLINE.

CAPITAL IS ALSO ALLOCATED FOR LIQUIDITY

RISK, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONTRACTUAL

SALES RESTRICTIONS TO WHICH SOME HOLDINGS

ARE SUBJECT. FOR PRIVATE EQUITIES,

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED BASED ON A LONG-TERM

EQUITY MARKET STRESS SCENARIO THAT IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT TIME

HORIZONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE HOLDINGS. FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS, ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IS

ALLOCATED AGAINST THE RISK OF AN

UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE NUMBER OF WRITE-OFFS

OR WRITE-DOWNS. THE FIRM REFINED ITS

METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003.

IT NOW ASSIGNS A MODERATELY HIGHER AMOUNT

OF CAPITAL FOR THE RISK IN THE PRIVATE

EQUITY PORTFOLIO, MOST OF WHICH IS

ASSIGNED TO JPMP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF

ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING

THE REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST

COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE

VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE

FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND

CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE

VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS

MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL

CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND

APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO

PERIOD.

IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE

INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR

CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN

APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS

ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE VALUATION

OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

APPROPRIATE.

THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT VALUATION

JUDGMENTS.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES COVERS THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER

LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE FIRMS

PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE

FIRMS LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. MANAGEMENT ALSO

COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY

SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE COMMERCIAL

LOAN PORTFOLIO. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING

THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGE 100 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FIRST AND

FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY

IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE

DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS

FACTORS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO

DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS LOANS.

COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR

INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS

ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN

ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR

LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE

THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS

EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES OF

REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF

CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND

THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE

OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED

ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION

AND CURRENT INFORMATION AS WELL AS

SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION.

EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR

CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY BE

RELEVANT IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATING OF

A PARTICULAR LOAN, BUT WHICH ARE NOT

CURRENTLY AN EXPLICIT PART OF THE FIRMS

METHODOLOGY, COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING

ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO

DERIVE LOSS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH

CREDIT FACILITY. THESE LOSS FACTORS ARE

DETERMINED BY FACILITY STRUCTURE,

COLLATERAL AND TYPE OF OBLIGOR. WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT,

VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS

FOR ESTIMATING THESE LOSS FACTORS. MANY

FACTORS CAN AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES

OF SPECIFIC LOSS AND EXPECTED LOSS,

INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF DEFAULT

PROBABILITIES, RATING MIGRATIONS AND LOSS

SEVERITY. FOR EXAMPLE, JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED TO DETERMINE HOW MANY YEARS OF

DATA TO INCLUDE WHEN ESTIMATING THE

POSSIBLE SEVERITY OF THE LOSS. IF A FULL

CREDIT CYCLE IS NOT CAPTURED IN THE DATA,

THEN ESTIMATES MAY BE INACCURATE.

LIKEWISE, JUDGMENT IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE

WHETHER THE LOSS-SEVERITY FACTOR SHOULD BE

CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER THE ENTIRE

CREDIT CYCLE OR WHETHER TO APPLY THE

LOSS-SEVERITY FACTOR IMPLIED AT A

PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE. THE

APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT LOSS-SEVERITY

FACTORS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

SIMILARLY, THERE ARE JUDGMENTS AS TO WHICH

EXTERNAL DATA ON DEFAULT PROBABILITIES

SHOULD BE USED, AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE

USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT

REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC LOAN

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD AFFECT

LOSS ESTIMATES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK

RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN. ASSUMING A

ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL

RISK RATINGS FOR ALL ITS COMMERCIAL LOANS,

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO WOULD INCREASE BY

APPROXIMATELY $470 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003. FURTHERMORE, ASSUMING A 10% INCREASE

IN THE LOSS SEVERITY ON ALL DOWNGRADED

NON-CRITICIZED LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR

COMMERCIAL LOANS WOULD INCREASE BY

APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003. THESE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES ARE

HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH

CAUTION. THE PURPOSE OF THESE ANALYSES IS

TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT

RISK RATINGS AND LOSS SEVERITY HAVE ON THE

ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED

TO IMPLY MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF

FUTURE DETERIORATION IN RISK RATINGS OR

CHANGES IN LOSS SEVERITY. GIVEN THE

PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN DETERMINING

THE RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS AND

ASSESSING LOSS SEVERITY, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE RISK RATINGS AND LOSS

SEVERITIES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO

COMMERCIAL LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE.

FURTHERMORE, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A

ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR ALL COMMERCIAL

LOANS WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME IS

REMOTE.

CONSUMER LOANS

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS SEGMENTED INTO

THREE MAIN BUSINESS LINES: CHASE HOME

FINANCE, CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES AND

CHASE AUTO FINANCE. FOR EACH MAJOR

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT WITHIN EACH LINE OF

BUSINESS, THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY FACTORS

THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE

EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES: PERIOD-END OUTSTANDINGS,

EXPECTED LOSS FACTOR AND AVERAGE LIFE. THE

VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THESE FACTORS, SUCH

AS COLLATERAL, PREPAYMENT RATES, CREDIT

SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS, COLLECTIONS AND THE

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF A BUSINESS

SEGMENT, DIFFER ACROSS BUSINESS LINES. FOR

EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD REVOLVING CREDIT HAS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHARGE-OFF RATIOS

THAN FIXED MORTGAGE CREDIT.

DETERMINATION OF EACH FACTOR IS BASED

PRIMARILY ON STATISTICAL DATA AND

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS.

RESIDUAL COMPONENT

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO APPLIED

WHEN CONSIDERING UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE

TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

DEVALUATION ON CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURES,

CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS,

UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS WITHIN THE

PORTFOLIO OR OTHER FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE,

JUDGMENT AS TO POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN A

PARTICULAR COUNTRY WILL AFFECT

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS

IN THE CREDITS THAT HAVE EXPOSURE TO THAT

COUNTRY. A SEPARATE ALLOWANCE COMPONENT,

THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT, IS MAINTAINED TO

COVER THESE UNCERTAINTIES, AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, IN THE

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO. IT IS ANTICIPATED

THAT THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT WILL RANGE

BETWEEN 10% AND 20% OF THE TOTAL

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE,

INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

AFS SECURITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE CARRIED AT

THE LOWER OF FAIR VALUE OR COST. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, APPROXIMATELY $346

BILLION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS WERE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS

DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE

INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT

TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER

THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE. THE

MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES OR ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS

THAT ARE BASED ON INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED

MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE

YIELD CURVES, OPTION VOLATILITIES AND

CURRENCY RATES.

THE VALUATION PROCESS TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY

AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND, FOR THE

DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

RISK. SEE THE DISCUSSION OF CVA ON PAGE

59 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. MANAGEMENT

APPLIES JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING THE

FACTORS USED IN THE VALUATION PROCESS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS OFTEN LIMITED

MARKET DATA TO RELY ON WHEN ESTIMATING

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LARGE OR AGED

POSITION. SIMILARLY, JUDGMENT MUST BE

APPLIED IN ESTIMATING PRICES FOR LESS

READILY OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL PARAMETERS.

FINALLY, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS MODEL

ASSUMPTIONS, MARKET DISLOCATIONS AND

UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS CAN AFFECT

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. IMPRECISION IN

ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN IMPACT THE

AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A

PARTICULAR POSITION.

TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES

HELD FOR TRADING AND INVESTMENT PURPOSES

(LONG POSITIONS) AND SECURITIES THAT THE

FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES

NOT OWN (SHORT POSITIONS) ARE

VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN SECURITIES ARE LESS

ACTIVELY TRADED AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT

ALWAYS ABLE TO BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES. THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR

FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT,

AS THIS DETERMINATION MAY REQUIRE

BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR

ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES.

AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON

AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS

THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE

ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO

EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY-PRICING SERVICES. CERTAIN

DERIVATIVES, HOWEVER, ARE VALUED BASED ON

MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS

THAT MAY BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE,

SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO

SUBSTANTIATE THE MODEL VALUATION. THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER LESS

ACTIVELY TRADED OR TRADE ACTIVITY IS

ONE-WAY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-DATED

INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY SWAPS, WHERE

SWAP RATES MAY BE UNOBSERVABLE FOR LONGER

MATURITIES; AND CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS,

WHERE CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE

UNOBSERVABLE.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INCLUDES RECORDING

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (I.E.,

REDUCTIONS) TO MODEL VALUATIONS TO

ACCOUNT FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY WHEN

VALUING COMPLEX OR LESS ACTIVELY TRADED

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS CONTROLS

IN PLACE. THESE INCLUDE: AN INDEPENDENT

REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF VALUATION MODELS;

DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION FOR PROFIT

AND LOSS ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME;

DECOMPOSING THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR

CERTAIN STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

INTO THEIR COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING

VALUATIONS, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR

PRODUCTS; AND VALIDATING VALUATION

ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT.

AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE

PRICING FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS

MORE TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM REFINES ITS

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. THE VALUATION

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE

HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY

BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES OF

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS, ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT

RISK THAT IS DISCOUNTED USING A RATE

APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT

INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE

CHANGES.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

VALUATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD BY

JPMP REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY

AND LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS.

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED

BASED ON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST

TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH

THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN

ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY JPMPS

SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY

OF FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO

ASSESS IMPAIRMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, INDUSTRY VALUATIONS

OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN

MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY

FINANCING ENVIRONMENT OVER TIME. THE

VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE

AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE

ACCURACY OF THE

CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS

HELD BY JPMP. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

DISCUSSION ON PAGE 74 AND NOTE 15 ON

PAGE 106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS

FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT

TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH

READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE,

SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, BUT THE PRECISE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND

CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS USING A

DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. THE

MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,

CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES AND

PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES,

LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES,

COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, TO RECENT

MARKET ACTIVITY AND TO ACTUAL PORTFOLIO

EXPERIENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

FAIR VALUES AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE

COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER MARKET

PARTICIPANTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

VALUE THESE RETAINED INTERESTS, AS WELL AS

THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE

ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTES 13 AND 16 ON PAGES

100-103 AND 107-109, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN

CHASE TRADES NONEX-CHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY

CONTRACTS. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE CONTRACTS, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH

ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON INTERNAL MODELS

WITH SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS. THE FIRMS NONEX-

CHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS ARE

PRIMARILY ENERGY-RELATED CONTRACTS. THE

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE

ADOPTED SFAS 123, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AND REQUIRES THAT ALL SUCH TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, BE ACCOUNTED FOR

AT FAIR VALUE AND BE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. AWARDS OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, IF NOT SUBSEQUENTLY

MODIFIED, CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER APB 25. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123, SEE NOTE 7 ON

PAGES 93-95 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46.

ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE ASSESSED FOR

CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46 ARE TYPICALLY

REFERRED TO AS SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

(SPES), ALTHOUGH NON-SPE-TYPE ENTITIES

MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE GUIDANCE. FIN

46 REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY

(VIE) TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY A COMPANY IF

THAT COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A MAJORITY OF

THE RISK OF LOSS FROM THE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITYS ACTIVITIES OR ENTITLED

TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITYS

RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH. EFFECTIVE

FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED FIN

46 FOR VIES CREATED OR MODIFIED AFTER

JANUARY 31, 2003, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS AN

INTEREST.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003, THE FIRM ADOPTED

THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 FOR ALL VIES

ORIGINATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003,

EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MADE BY

JPMP. THE FASB PROVIDED A SPECIFIC

DEFERRAL FOR NONREGISTERED INVESTMENT

COMPANIES UNTIL THE PROPOSED STATEMENT OF

POSITION ON THE CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE

OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY AUDIT GUIDE IS

FINALIZED, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN

MID-2004. THE FIRM HAS DEFERRED

CONSOLIDATION OF $2.7 BILLION OF

ADDITIONAL ASSETS RELATED TO JPMP AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003. FOR FURTHER DETAILS

REGARDING FIN 46, REFER TO NOTE 14 ON

PAGES 103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A

REVISION TO FIN 46 (FIN 46R) TO ADDRESS

VARIOUS TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN

SINCE ITS ISSUANCE. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN

46R ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL PERIODS

ENDING AFTER MARCH 15, 2004, THUS THE FIRM

WILL IMPLEMENT THE NEW PROVISIONS

EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2004. AS FIN 46R WAS

RECENTLY ISSUED AND CONTAINS PROVISIONS

THAT THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION CONTINUES

TO ANALYZE, THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT OF THE

IMPACT OF FIN 46R ON ALL VIES WITH WHICH IT

IS INVOLVED IS ONGOING. HOWEVER, AT THIS

TIME AND BASED ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT

INTERPRETATION, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

EARNINGS OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

IN MAY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 150,

WHICH ESTABLISHES

STANDARDS FOR HOW AN ISSUER CLASSIFIES AND

MEASURES IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES

AND EQUITY. IT REQUIRES THAT AN ISSUER

CLASSI-

FY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT IS WITHIN

ITS SCOPE AS A LIABILITY (OR AN ASSET IN

SOME CIRCUMSTANCES), BECAUSE THAT

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT EMBODIES AN

OBLIGATION OF THE ISSUER. INITIALLY, SFAS

150 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MODIFIED AFTER

MAY 31, 2003, AND WAS OTHERWISE EFFECTIVE

BEGINNING JULY 1, 2003. IN NOVEMBER 2003,

THE FASB DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

THE STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO MANDATORILY

REDEEMABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF

CERTAIN NONPUBLIC ENTITIES AND FOR CERTAIN

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS 150

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

IN APRIL 2003, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 149,

WHICH AMENDS AND CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN

OTHER CONTRACTS, AND FOR HEDGING

ACTIVITIES UNDER SFAS 133. SPECIFICALLY,

SFAS 149 CLARIFIES THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER

WHICH A CONTRACT WITH AN INITIAL NET

INVESTMENT MEETS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A

DERIVATIVE, AND WHEN A DERIVATIVE CONTAINS

A FINANCING COMPONENT THAT WARRANTS

SPECIAL REPORTING IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. SFAS 149 IS

GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR CONTRACTS ENTERED

INTO OR MODIFIED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003;

IMPLEMENTATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN 2003.

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 146,

WHICH ESTABLISHES NEW ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2002. SFAS 146 REQUIRES A LIABILITY FOR A

COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITY TO BE RECORDED WHEN THAT

LIABILITY IS INCURRED AND CAN BE MEASURED

AT FAIR VALUE. UNDER THE PREVIOUS RULES,

IF MANAGEMENT APPROVED AN EXIT PLAN IN ONE

QUARTER, THE COSTS OF THAT PLAN GENERALLY

WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE SAME

QUARTER EVEN IF THE COSTS WERE NOT

INCURRED UNTIL A LATER QUARTER. IN

CONTRAST, UNDER SFAS 146, SOME COSTS MAY

QUALIFY FOR IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION, WHILE

OTHER COSTS MAY BE INCURRED OVER ONE OR

MORE QUARTERS. THE IMPACT OF SFAS 146 WILL

GENERALLY BE TO SPREAD OUT THE TIMING OF

THE RECOGNITION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.

IMPAIRMENT OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES

IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK

FORCE (EITF) REACHED A CONSENSUS ON

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN

CONNECTION WITH ITS DELIBERATIONS OF ISSUE

03-1, THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY

SECURITIES UNDER SFAS 115. SEE NOTE 9 ON

PAGE 97 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT WHICH SETS

FORTH THE DISCLOSURES NOW REQUIRED.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE FIRM

ADOPTED SFAS 142 WHICH ESTABLISHES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER

THAN THOSE ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION). IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO AN

ACQUISITION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 142, SEE NOTE 16 ON

PAGE 107 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN LOANS OR DEBT SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE AICPA ISSUED

STATEMENT OF POSITION 03-3 (SOP 03-3),

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN LOANS OR DEBT

SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER. SOP

03-3 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING

FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTRACTUAL AND

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PURCHASERS

INITIAL INVESTMENT IN LOANS OR DEBT

SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER, IF

THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE, AT

LEAST IN PART, TO CREDIT QUALITY. AMONG

OTHER THINGS, SOP 03-3: (1) PROHIBITS THE

RECOGNITION OF THE EXCESS OF CONTRACTUAL

CASH FLOWS OVER EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AS AN

ADJUSTMENT OF YIELD, LOSS ACCRUAL OR

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT THE TIME OF

PURCHASE; (2) REQUIRES THAT SUBSEQUENT

INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS BE

RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY THROUGH AN

ADJUSTMENT OF YIELD; AND (3) REQUIRES THAT

SUBSEQUENT DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS BE RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPAIRMENT. IN

ADDITION, SOP 03-3 PROHIBITS THE CREATION

OR CARRYING OVER OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE

IN THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING OF ALL LOANS

WITHIN ITS SCOPE THAT ARE ACQUIRED IN A

TRANSFER. SOP 03-3 BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR

LOANS OR DEBT SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2004.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRADING DERIVATIVES

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE EITF CONCLUDED ON

ISSUE 02-3, WHICH, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2003, PRECLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING

FOR ENERGY-RELATED CONTRACTS THAT DO NOT

MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE UNDER

SFAS 133 (I.E., TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE OR

CAPACITY CONTRACTS). THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED

THIS PROVISION OF ISSUE 02-3 EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2003; IMPLEMENTATION DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. IN

NOVEMBER 2002, AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION

OF ISSUE 02-3, THE FASB STAFF FURTHER

CONFIRMED THEIR VIEW THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD

NOT RECOGNIZE PROFIT AT THE INCEPTION OF A

TRADE INVOLVING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF: (A) QUOTED

MARKET PRICES IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, (B)

OBSERVABLE PRICES OF OTHER CURRENT MARKET

TRANSACTIONS OR (C) OTHER OBSERVABLE DATA

SUPPORTING A VALUATION TECHNIQUE. THIS

CLARIFICATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN 2002 AND 2003. THE

FASB INTENDS IN 2004 TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS

ON ISSUES RELATING TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST RATE LOCK COMMITMENTS (IRLCS)

IRLCS ASSOCIATED WITH MORTGAGES

(COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AT SPECIFIED

INTEREST RATES) ARE CURRENTLY ACCOUNTED

FOR AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 149. IRLCS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT.

IN OCTOBER 2003, THE FASB ADDED A NEW

PROJECT TO ITS AGENDA TO

CLARIFY SFAS 133, WITH RESPECT TO THE

INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE USED TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF IRLCS THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES, AND WHETHER

LOAN COMMITMENTS SHOULD BE REPORTED AS

ASSETS BY THE ISSUER OF THAT COMMITMENT

(I.E., THE LENDER). IN DECEMBER 2003, THE

SEC PRESCRIBED GUIDANCE THAT IRLCS WERE

DEEMED TO BE WRITTEN OPTIONS FROM THE

STANDPOINT OF THE MORTGAGE LENDER AND, AS

A RESULT, SHOULD BE RECORDED AS A

LIABILITY AT INCEPTION AND REMAIN A

LIABILITY UNTIL THE LOAN IS FUNDED. THIS

GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR IRLCS

ENTERED INTO WITH POTENTIAL BORROWERS

AFTER MARCH 31, 2004. THIS GUIDANCE WILL

IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION

RELATED TO IRLCS. FURTHER, THE IMPACT OF

THIS GUIDANCE ON THE FIRMS CURRENT

PRACTICE WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE VOLUME

OF NEW IRLCS, THE VOLUME OF LOAN SALES AND

THE CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES

DURING THE PERIOD. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY

ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON

ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND HEDGING

STRATEGIES.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN JUNE 2003, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION ADOPTED FINAL RULES UNDER

SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF

2002 (SECTION 404). COMMENCING WITH ITS

2004 ANNUAL REPORT, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO INCLUDE A REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

ON THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE INTERNAL CONTROL

REPORT MUST INCLUDE A STATEMENT OF

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

FOR THE FIRM; OF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF YEAR-END; OF THE FRAMEWORK USED BY

MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING; AND THAT THE FIRMS

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS ISSUED AN

ATTESTATION REPORT ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH REPORT IS

ALSO REQUIRED TO BE FILED AS PART OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

COMPARISON BETWEEN 2002 AND 2001

JPMORGAN CHASES 2002 NET INCOME WAS $1.7

BILLION, RELATIVELY FLAT WHEN COMPARED

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE

WAS $0.80 IN 2002, UNCHANGED FROM 2001.

TOTAL REVENUES FOR 2002 OF $29.6 BILLION

WERE UP BY ONLY 1% FROM 2001. THE CONSUMER

BUSINESSES OF THE FIRM CONTRIBUTED TO THE

HIGHER REVENUE, BENEFITING PRIMARILY FROM

THE GRADUAL REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES IN

2002. MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AT CHASE HOME

FINANCE IN HIGH-MARGIN SECTORS LIKE

RETAIL, WHOLESALE, TELEPHONE-BASED AND

E-COMMERCE REACHED $113 BILLION, 30% ABOVE

THE LEVEL REACHED IN 2001. THIS

EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH, HOWEVER, WAS PARTLY

OFFSET BY THE SLUGGISHNESS IN THE

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY IB, DUE TO

THE CONTINUED SLOWDOWN IN MARKET

ACTIVITIES, A REFLECTION OF THE WEAK

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND DIMINISHED

INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

FROM A BUSINESS-SEGMENT POINT OF VIEW, THE

REVENUE RESULTS WERE MIXED IN 2002. CFS

REVENUE OF $13.4 BILLION GREW BY 24% OVER

2001, REFLECTING HIGH VOLUMES ACROSS ALL

CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESSES AND SIGNIFICANT

GAINS IN CHASE HOME FINANCE FROM THE

HEDGING OF MSRS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

NEGATIVE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON

DEPOSITS. TSS REPORTED MODEST REVENUE

GROWTH, AS STRONG GAINS IN TREASURY

SERVICES AND INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES,

ATTRIBUTABLE MOSTLY TO NEW BUSINESSES,

WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INVESTOR

SERVICES, WHICH SUFFERED FROM THE LOWER

VALUE OF ASSETS HELD UNDER CUSTODY. THESE

INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE

FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. IN IB,

REVENUE DECLINED 15%, DRIVEN BY THE

REDUCTION IN CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING

REVENUE, AS WELL AS IN INVESTMENT BANKING

FEES. THE REDUCTION IN CAPITAL MARKETS

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

LOWER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REVENUE RELATED

TO BOTH FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES

TRANSACTIONS. IMPBS REVENUE IN 2002

DECLINED 11% FROM 2001, REFLECTING THE

DEPRECIATION IN THE EQUITIES MARKET AND

INSTITUTIONAL OUTFLOWS ACROSS ALL

ASSET CLASSES. JPMP RECOGNIZED PRIVATE

EQUITY LOSSES OF $733 MILLION IN 2002,

COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $1.2 BILLION IN

2001, AS A RESULT OF LOWER LEVELS OF

WRITE-DOWNS AND WRITE-OFFS, PARTICULARLY

IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SECTORS.

THE FIRMS TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS

$22.8 BILLION IN 2002, DOWN 4% FROM 2001,

WITH BOTH YEARS INCURRING SEVERAL LARGE

CHARGES. IN 2002, THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

WERE $1.2 BILLION, VERSUS $2.5 BILLION IN

2001. IN ADDITION, IN 2002, THE FIRM

RECORDED A $1.3 BILLION CHARGE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF ITS

ENRON-RELATED SURETY LITIGATION AND THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESERVE RELATED TO

CERTAIN MATERIAL LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS

AND INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A $98

MILLION CHARGE FOR UNOCCUPIED EXCESS REAL

ESTATE. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE

CHARGES IN BOTH YEARS, THE FIRMS

FULL-YEAR 2002 NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF

$20.2 BILLION WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF 2001.

SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS FROM EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, APPROXIMATELY 70%

OF WHICH WERE IN IB, ADDED $890 MILLION TO

NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2002. THESE

CHARGES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE

CONTINUED FOCUS ON EXPENSES, WHICH KEPT

SPENDING LEVELS LOW, AND BY THE ADOPTION

IN 2002 OF SFAS 142, WHICH ELIMINATED THE

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL.

ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS REPORTED

LOWER-TO-FLAT NONINTEREST EXPENSES,

EXCEPT CFS, WHERE HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES

RESULTED IN EXPENSE GROWTH. IB AND IMPB

REDUCED HEADCOUNT IN RESPONSE TO LOWER

MARKET ACTIVITY LEVELS. AT TSS, TIGHT

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT IN 2002 ALLOWED FOR

INVESTMENTS WHILE KEEPING EXPENSE LEVELS ESSENTIALLY

FLAT WITH 2001.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED

TO $4.3 BILLION IN 2002, UP 36% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR. THIS WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO TROUBLED COMMERCIAL

CREDITS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

CABLE SECTORS AND THE IMPACT OF THE

PROVIDIAN ACQUISITION IN 2002, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER

PROVISION, REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2002 WAS $856

MILLION, COMPARED WITH $847 MILLION IN

2001. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34% IN

2002, VERSUS 33% IN 2001. THE INCREASE IN

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LEVEL OF INCOME

EARNED IN CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL TAX

JURISDICTIONS IN 2002.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 1

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE

OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY FOR A GROUP OF SUBSIDIARIES THAT

PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES TO A

GLOBAL CLIENT BASE THAT INCLUDES

CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENTS, INSTITUTIONS

AND INDIVIDUALS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION, SEE

NOTE 34 ON PAGES 126-127 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING

POLICIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND

PREVAILING INDUSTRY PRACTICES.

ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE

POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND

REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY BANK

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND

OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A

CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL

MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST IS OWNERSHIP OF A

MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTERESTS OF AN

ENTITY. HOWEVER, A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST MAY ALSO EXIST IN ENTITIES, SUCH

AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES),

THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE

VOTING INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET

LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS

ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS

AND RISKS. THEY ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CRITICAL

TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS

TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND

ARE TYPICALLY SET UP FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT OPERATING

ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE NO EMPLOYEES AND

A LIMITED LIFE. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE

INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE

SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE

ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS.

THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED

ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE

SPES INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT

HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES CAN

BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE,

THEREBY INSULATING INVESTORS FROM THE

IMPACT OF THE CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES,

INCLUDING THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING

FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO SPES, DEPENDING

ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE FIRMS

RELATION TO THAT ENTITY; THE QUALIFYING

SPE (QSPE) FRAMEWORK UNDER SFAS 140 AND

THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE)

FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46. THE QSPE FRAMEWORK

IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY TRANSFERS

(SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE MEETING

CERTAIN CRITERIA. THESE CRITERIA ARE

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE

ACTIVITIES OF

THE SPE ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED IN

THEIR ENTIRETY AT THE INCEPTION OF THE

VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR CANNOT

EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THE ENTITY. ENTITIES

MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT

CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFERORS. THE FIRM

PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE QSPE MODEL FOR THE

SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD LOANS

AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS,

SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 100-103 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN THE SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE

CRITERIA, CONSOLIDATION

IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46. A VIE IS

DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT: LACKS ENOUGH

EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO PERMIT THE

ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT

FROM OTHER PARTIES; HAS EQUITY OWNERS WHO

ARE UNABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS, AND/OR; HAS

EQUITY OWNERS THAT DO NOT ABSORB OR

RECEIVE THE ENTITYS LOSSES AND RETURNS.

VIES ENCOMPASS VEHICLES TRADITIONALLY

VIEWED AS SPES AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE OTHER

ENTITIES OR LEGAL STRUCTURES, SUCH AS

CERTAIN LIMITED-PURPOSE SUBSIDIARIES,

TRUSTS OR INVESTMENT FUNDS. ENTITIES EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF FIN 46 INCLUDE

ALL QSPES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIRM

WAS THE TRANSFEROR, AS LONG AS THE FIRM

DOES NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO

LIQUIDATE THE VEHICLE OR CAUSE IT TO NO

LONGER MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA, AND OTHER

ENTITIES THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA

SPECIFIED IN FIN 46.

FIN 46 REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST

HOLDER (COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF THAT PARTY WILL

ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES

OF THE VIE, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE

RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS

PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE ENTITY. THE

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE FIRM MEETS

THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF A VIE REQUIRES AN

EVALUATION OF ALL TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS

INVESTMENTS, LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES AND FEE ARRANGEMENTS) WITH THE

ENTITY. THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS EVALUATION

IS AN EXPECTED-LOSS CALCULATION PRESCRIBED

BY FIN 46. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE

14 ON PAGES 103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIOR TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF FIN 46,

THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO

CONSOLIDATE DEPENDED ON THE APPLICABLE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR NON-QSPES,

INCLUDING A DETERMINATION REGARDING THE

NATURE AND AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT MADE BY

THIRD PARTIES IN THE SPE. CONSIDERATION

WAS GIVEN TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WHETHER

A THIRD PARTY HAD MADE A SUBSTANTIVE

EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE SPE; WHICH PARTY

HAD VOTING RIGHTS, IF ANY; WHO MADE

DECISIONS ABOUT THE ASSETS IN THE SPE; AND

WHO WAS AT RISK OF LOSS. THE SPE WAS

CONSOLIDATED IF JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINED OR

ACQUIRED CONTROL OVER THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS SOLD TO AN SPE OR A VIE

ARE DERECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) THE ASSETS ARE

LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS

CREDITORS, (2) THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR

A SALE ARE MET AND (3) THE SPE IS A QSPE

UNDER SFAS 140, OR THE SPE CAN PLEDGE OR

EXCHANGE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS. ALL

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND RETAINED

INTERESTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND

NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE REFLECTED ON

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES

UNDER FIN 46, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND

FINANCING DECISIONS (GENERALLY DEFINED AS

OWNING A VOTING OR ECONOMIC INTEREST OF

20% TO 50%), ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, AND

THE FIRMS SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS IS

INCLUDED IN OTHER REVENUE. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 106 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR

FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT

ASSETS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR

PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUE, EXPENSE AND DISCLOSURES OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO

U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE RATES OF

EXCHANGE. JPMORGAN CHASE TRANSLATES

REVENUES AND EXPENSES USING EXCHANGE

RATES AT THE TRANSACTION DATE.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR U.S. REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WITHIN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

IS THE U.S. DOLLAR AND OPERATIONS IN

HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENTS, ARE

REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME.

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

87 AND SFAS 88. ITS POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

106.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF

DECEMBER 31 FOR ITS POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. THE FAIR VALUE OF

PLAN ASSETS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR ITS

U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS. FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN, THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE, WHICH

RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, IS USED TO DETERMINE THE

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS.

UNRECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE

REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE PLAN

PARTICIPANTS, IF REQUIRED.

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON

DECEMBER 8, 2003. AS PERMITTED UNDER FSP

SFAS 106-1, JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO

DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN OF THE

EFFECTS OF THE ACT PENDING ISSUANCE OF

FINAL GUIDANCE AND TRANSITION RULES. THE

FIRM IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE ACT AND

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ITS U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN. ACCORDINGLY,

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AND NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS

RELATED TO THIS PLAN DO NOT REFLECT THE

EFFECTS OF THE ACT. ONCE FINAL GUIDANCE IS

ISSUED, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION IS

SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A QUALIFIED

NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S.

PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, IN

THE FORM OF SERVICE AND INTEREST CREDITS,

TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT

RETIREMENT, BASED ON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION

AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO

ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE

YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS VEST AFTER

FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO

OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN

CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF

SERVICE.

IT IS JPMORGAN CHASES POLICY TO FUND ITS

PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO

MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS. IN

2003, THE FIRM MADE TWO CASH CONTRIBUTIONS

TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN.

$127 MILLION ON FEBRUARY 10 TO FULLY FUND

THE PLANS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND $200 MILLION ON

DECEMBER 29 TO FULLY FUND THE PLANS

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM

MADE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $87

MILLION TO FUND FULLY THE ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003. BASED ON THE CURRENT

FUNDED STATUS OF THE U.S. AND NON-U.S.

PENSION PLANS, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO

MAKE SIGNIFICANT FUNDINGS IN 2004.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS (I.E., U.S.

PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT).

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE

EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN SERVICE CREDITS ON

COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM

STIPULATED BY LAW. THIS PLAN IS A

NONQUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION

PLAN WITH AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT EACH OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, IN THE AMOUNT

OF $178 MILLION. COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO THE FIRMS OTHER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TOTALED $19 MILLION

IN 2003, $15 MILLION IN 2002 AND $22

MILLION IN 2001.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE

OF ITS INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED

LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE) RETURNS FOR

THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY

THE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION. ASSET-CLASS

RETURNS ARE DEVELOPED USING A

FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH

AND ARE NOT BASED STRICTLY ON HISTORICAL

RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION,

EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND

EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND

RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE

SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND

RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED

FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM

CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS

RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR

RELATIONSHIP TO EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH REPRESENTS THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. PENSION

PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE

UNITED STATES ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL

MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC

ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS

IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS

FOR EACH ASSET CLASS, SELECTED BY REFERENCE

TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT

BONDS AND AA-RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE

BONDS, PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE

RISK-FREE RATE.

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR

THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE

INSURANCE PLANS IS COMPUTED USING PROCEDURES

SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR THE U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLAN.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS IS

SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YEAR-END

MOODYS CORPORATE AA RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER

HIGH-QUALITY INDICES WITH SIMILAR DURATION

TO THAT OF THE RESPECTIVE PLANS BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS SELECTED BY

REFERENCE TO THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE

AA 15-YEAR-PLUS BOND RATE.

(44

)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FIRM REDUCED THE

DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE ITS U.S.

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO 6.00%. THE FIRM

ALSO REDUCED THE 2004 EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS TO

7.75% AND 7.00%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ITS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003, TO THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

AND THE DISCOUNT RATE IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE 2004 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES BY

APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION. THE IMPACT OF

THE CHANGES TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

AND THE DISCOUNT RATE ON NON-U.S. PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES IS

NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES ARE MOST

SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. WITH ALL OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS

POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD

RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $15

MILLION IN 2004 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES.

ADDITIONALLY, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD

RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2004 U.S. PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES

OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION AND AN

INCREASE IN THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

OF APPROXIMATELY $143 MILLION. THE IMPACT

OF A DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE RELATED

TO THE U.S. PENSION PLAN WOULD BE

SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF A

SIMILAR REDUCTION IN THE ASSUMED INTEREST

RATE USED FOR CREDITING PARTICIPANT

BALANCES.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO

OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS

APPROPRIATE TO THE RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS

AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF

VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY

MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR AND

ISSUER. SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO

OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX FOR FUTURE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING VARIOUS RISK

FACTORS AND EACH PLANS INVESTMENT RETURN

OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN

THE U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET

ALLOCATION, IN RECOGNITION OF ITS

LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN ASSETS ARE

MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND, ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS, ARE REBALANCED TO TARGET,

TO THE EXTENT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL.

THE FIRMS U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE

HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE INVESTED IN

WELL DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY

(INCLUDING U.S. LARGE AND SMALL

CAPITALIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL

EQUITIES), FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING

CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS), TREASURY

INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD

SECURITIES, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OTHER

SECURITIES. NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS

ARE SIMILARLY INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED

PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND

OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRMS

COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND

PARTIALLY THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH

AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN

EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS.

ASSETS USED TO FUND THE FIRMS U.S. AND

NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DO NOT

INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK,

EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN

THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND

CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN

CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN

ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIOS. FOR MOST EMPLOYEES, THE FIRM MATCHES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS

DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION PER PAY

PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE; BENEFITS VEST AFTER THREE

YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRMS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE ADMINISTERED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE PLANS TOTALED $240 MILLION IN 2003, $251

MILLION IN 2002 AND $208 MILLION IN 2001.

NOTE 7

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE ADOPTED SFAS 123 USING THE

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. SFAS 123 REQUIRES ALL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE

IS BASED ON A BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL, WITH COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD. UNDER

THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, ALL NEW AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ON OR

AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 123. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123, THE FIRM DECIDED TO PROVIDE KEY EMPLOYEES, EXCLUDING

MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WITH THE ABILITY TO ELECT TO RECEIVE THE

VALUE OF THEIR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AS STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED

STOCK OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF. THE NET EFFECT WAS TO REDUCE NET INCOME BY

$0.08 PER SHARE IN 2003. AWARDS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

IF NOT SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED, CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25.

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002, JPMORGAN CHASE ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER THE

INTRINSIC-VALUE METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH APB 25. UNDER THIS METHOD, NO EXPENSE

IS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AT THE STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE,

SINCE SUCH OPTIONS HAVE NO INTRINSIC VALUE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED

STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) IS MEASURED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

SHARES GRANTED AND THE STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE AND IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE

REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD.

KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES UNDER TWO PLANS (THE LTI PLANS). THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN,

APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN MAY 2000, PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS,

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSU AWARDS, AND THE

STOCK OPTION PLAN, A NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN, PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS AND SARS. THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003, SARS HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED UNDER

EITHER OF THESE PLANS.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. GENERALLY, OPTIONS

CANNOT BE EXERCISED UNTIL AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND BECOME

EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT.

OPTIONS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. IN JANUARY 2001,

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED 82.2 MILLION OPTIONS UNDER THE LTI PLANS, PURSUANT TO A

GROWTH PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM (GPIP). FORFEITURES OF GPIP OPTIONS

AGGREGATED 23.7 MILLION SHARES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS ARE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER THE LTI PLANS AT

NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT. RESTRICTED STOCK/ RSUS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE

UNTIL CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED, INCLUDING CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR A

SPECIFIED PERIOD. THE RECIPIENT OF A SHARE OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO

VOTING RIGHTS AND DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK. AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT

TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AFTER THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE; THE

RECIPIENT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO DIVIDENDS ON THE

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING.

DURING 2003, 43.5 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK/RSU AWARDS WERE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN

CHASE UNDER THE LTI PLANS. IN 2002 AND 2001, 24.0 MILLION AND 25.9 MILLION

AWARDS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE GRANTED UNDER THESE PLANS. ALL THESE AWARDS ARE

PAYABLE SOLELY IN STOCK. THE 2001 GRANTS INCLUDED 1.3 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK/

RSU AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITABLE IF CERTAIN TARGET PRICES ARE NOT ACHIEVED. THE

VESTING OF THESE AWARDS IS CONDITIONED UPON CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS BEING

MET AND JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE REACHING AND SUSTAINING TARGET

PRICES WITHIN A FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DURING 2002, IT WAS DETERMINED

THAT IT WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE TARGET STOCK PRICES RELATED TO

FORFEITABLE AWARDS GRANTED IN 1999, 2000 AND 2001 WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITHIN

THEIR RESPECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND ACCORDINGLY, PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED

EXPENSES WERE

REVERSED. THE TARGET STOCK

PRICES FOR THESE AWARDS RANGED FROM $73.33 TO

$85.00. THESE AWARDS WILL BE FORFEITED IN 2004 THROUGH 2006 IF THE TARGET STOCK

PRICES ARE NOT ACHIEVED.

A PORTION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THAT EXCEEDED

SPECIFIED LEVELS WAS AWARDED IN RESTRICTED STOCK/ RSU AWARDS OR OTHER DEFERRED

INVESTMENTS (THE REQUIRED DEFERRAL PLAN) ISSUED UNDER THE LTI PLANS. THESE

RESTRICTED STOCK/RSU AND OTHER DEFERRED AWARDS VEST BASED SOLELY ON CONTINUED

EMPLOYMENT. DURING 2001, 137,500 OF SUCH RESTRICTED STOCK/UNITS WERE GRANTED.

THE REQUIRED DEFERRAL PLAN WAS DISCONTINUED IN 2002.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN JANUARY 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED 12.8 MILLION OPTIONS TO ALL ELIGIBLE

FULL-TIME (150 OPTIONS EACH) AND PART-TIME (75 OPTIONS EACH) EMPLOYEES UNDER

THE VALUE SHARING PLAN, A NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS

EQUAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. THE OPTIONS

BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS AND GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE

GRANT DATE.

COMPARISON OF THE FAIR AND

PRE-TAX EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE PLANS

TOTALED $919 MILLION IN 2003 (WHICH INCLUDES THE $266 MILLION IMPACT OF

ADOPTING SFAS 123), $590 MILLION IN 2002 AND $798 MILLION IN 2001. COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR 2002 INCLUDED THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSE OF $120

MILLION RELATED TO FORFEITABLE KEY EMPLOYEE AWARDS GRANTED IN 1999, 2000 AND

2001, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS NET INCOME AND BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE AS REPORTED, AND AS IF ALL OUTSTANDING AWARDS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE. THE LOWER EXPENSE FROM APPLYING SFAS 123 IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS, A LOWER COMMON STOCK PRICE, LOWER BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION FAIR VALUES AND

LONGER VESTING PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE AFTER APPLYING SFAS

123 IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 REFLECTS A HIGHER LEVEL OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

PRIOR YEARS THAT WERE NOT FULLY VESTED. THIS INCREASE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECLINE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

2002.

INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS

THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER; AND

THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR AN

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE. IF, BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, IT IS

DETERMINED THAT THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN

DOWN AND A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO

DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN

SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. SECURITIES

THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE

CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDED IN THE $799 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 IS $46 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT HAVE

EXISTED FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE LOSSES PRIMARILY RELATE TO

$1.5 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES HELD BY COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS THAT

WERE CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46 ON JULY 1, 2003. THE

SECURITIES HELD BY THE CONDUITS ARE OF HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, PREDOMINANTLY RATED

AA OR BETTER. UPON ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE SECURITIES WERE MEASURED AT THE

AMOUNTS AT WHICH SUCH INTERESTS WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED HAD THE FIRM

CONSOLIDATED THE CONDUITS WHEN IT FIRST MET THE CONDITIONS TO BE CONSIDERED THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY; THIS RESULTED IN AN INITIAL TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGE 106. THE OVERALL

DEPRECIATION IN FAIR VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE ILLIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR THESE SECURITIES AND IS CONSIDERED

TEMPORARY, AS THE FIRM HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS

WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE UNREALIZED MARKET VALUE LOSS WILL BE RECOVERED.

IN CALCULATING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) AND

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMO), JPMORGAN CHASE ACTIVELY MONITORS

THE LIKELIHOOD OF PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENT THROUGH ITS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

FUNCTION. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY PERFORMS SIMULATION TESTING TO DETERMINE THE

IMPACT THAT MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE ON ITS MBS AND CMO PORTFOLIOS. MBSS

AND CMOS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES HAVE HIGH PREPAYMENT RISK ARE INCLUDED IN THE

AFS PORTFOLIO AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AMORTIZED COST, ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND

SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES

BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY TO FINANCE

THE FIRMS INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND

SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO THESE

TRANSACTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) ARE

GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL BE

SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. WHERE APPROPRIATE,

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A

NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 41.

JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND REQUESTS ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES WHEN NECESSARY.

SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER THAN FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE) OF THE

UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A FORWARD OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE

SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A DERIVATIVE, IS RECORDED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS PURCHASES UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $15 BILLION AND $8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SALES UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $8 BILLION AND $13 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE SHORT-TERM DURATION OF THESE

CONTRACTS, THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IS INSIGNIFICANT.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH

COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST

INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES-LENDING AGREEMENTS OR TO COVER SHORT

NOTE 11

LOANS

LOANS ARE REPORTED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES. LOANS HELD FOR

SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF AGGREGATE COST OR FAIR VALUE. LOANS ARE

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING FOR SECONDARY MARKET TRADING ACTIVITIES WHERE POSITIONS

ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD TO MAKE PROFITS FROM SHORT-TERM MOVEMENTS IN PRICE. LOANS

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND ARE CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN TRADING REVENUE. INTEREST

INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST METHOD, OR ON A BASIS APPROXIMATING A

LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED.

LOANS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON

NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF

PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR

MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN

IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN

ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST

INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN

CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF

LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL CASH THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE LOAN. LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY

ASSURED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON

REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (FFIEC) POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE,

CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF AT THE EARLIER OF 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN

60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING OF BANKRUPTCY. RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 180 DAYS

PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF (TO NET REALIZABLE

VALUE IF COLLATERALIZED) AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCUSSED ABOVE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED

AGAINST INTEREST INCOME WHEN THE CONSUMER LOAN IS CHARGED OFF.

A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURE AND IS

RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN

OTHER ASSETS, ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE

COLLATERAL. THIS IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE

TAKEN PLACE.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES FOR WHICH EITHER THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF

THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. WITHIN THE ALLOWANCE, THERE ARE

SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS AND A RESIDUAL COMPONENT.

THE SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT COVERS THOSE COMMERCIAL LOANS DEEMED BY THE FIRM TO

BE CRITICIZED. THE FIRM INTERNALLY CATEGORIZES ITS CRITICIZED COMMERCIAL LOANS

INTO THREE GROUPS: DOUBTFUL, SUBSTANDARD AND SPECIAL-MENTION.

CRITICIZED NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS (EXCLUDING LEASES) ARE CONSIDERED TO

BE IMPAIRED LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS IS COMPUTED USING THE

METHODOLOGY UNDER SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS (OR COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF AN IMPAIRED LOAN

ARE LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE SPECIFIC LOSS

COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY,

AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. CRITICIZED BUT PERFORMING LOANS

ALSO ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL, USING HISTORICAL LOSS RATES.

THE EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS (EXCEPT

CRITICIZED LOANS) AND CONSUMER LOANS. EXPECTED LOSSES ARE THE PRODUCT OF

DEFAULT PROBABILITY AND LOSS SEVERITY. THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK

RATING AND MATURITY FOR COMMERCIAL LOANS. THE EXPECTED LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE FIRMS HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.

FINALLY, A RESIDUAL COMPONENT IS MAINTAINED TO COVER UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD

AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES. THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE

ALLOWANCE REFLECTS THE MARGIN OF IMPRECISION IN THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS USED

FOR ESTIMATING SPECIFIC LOSSES AND EXPECTED LOSSES. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE

RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WILL RANGE BETWEEN 10% AND 20% OF THE TOTAL

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWS, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED BASED ON

THAT REVIEW IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E.,

SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO BUT NOT YET

IDENTIFIABLE).

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE CREDIT EXTENSION PROCESS,

MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES SPECIFIC AND EXPECTED LOSS COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS A

RESIDUAL COMPONENT, FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR

TO THAT USED FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES, SELLS AND SERVICES VARIOUS CONSUMER LOANS

ORIGINATED BY CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES (RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND

AUTOMOBILE LOANS), AS WELL AS CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY REAL ESTATE)

ORIGINATED BY THE INVESTMENT BANK. INTERESTS IN THE SOLD AND SECURITIZED LOANS

MAY BE RETAINED AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE TRANSFERRED

LOANS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS AND THE ACCOUNTING

CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED

BETWEEN THE LOANS SOLD AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS, BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR

VALUES AT THE DATE OF SALE. SINCE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE GENERALLY NOT

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABLE, THE FIRM USUALLY ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY

DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING MODELING

TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY

VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND DISCOUNT RATES

APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN

OTHER REVENUE. RETAINED INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK, SUCH

THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT, ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN EARNINGS, IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RETAINED INTEREST

HAS DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND SUCH DECLINE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO

BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE

SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A

QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW) BUT ARE

INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE SPE PURCHASING THE ASSETS. ASSETS HELD BY

INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE GENERALLY RETAINED BY THE FIRM IN THE

FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, SUBORDINATED TRANCHES,

ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND SERVICING RIGHTS, AND THEY ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN OTHER

ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS, REPRESENTING THE FIRMS

INTERESTS IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

SECURITIZED. THESE INTERESTS ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE

FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN

LOANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE,

CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IT ESTABLISHES. THE FIRM RECEIVES ANNUAL SERVICING FEES

BASED ON THE SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE PLUS CERTAIN ANCILLARY FEES. IT ALSO

RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IT SELLS IN

CONNECTION WITH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT

NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (GNMA), FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION

(FNMA) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC). FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 107-109 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM SOLD RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $123 BILLION AND

$62.2 BILLION DURING 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY AS GNMA, FNMA AND

FREDDIE MAC MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; THESE SALES RESULTED IN GAINS OF $564

INTEREST AND FEES ON THE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO PREDETERMINED LIMITS FOR SOME OF

ITS CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF

DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS OWED TO INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN SUCH

ESCROW ACCOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

DURING 2003, THE FIRM SOLD CERTAIN RESIDUAL INTERESTS OF APPROXIMATELY

(NIM) SECURITIZATIONS. THE FIRM RETAINED RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN THESE AND

PRIOR NIM SECURITIZATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $169.8 MILLION, WHICH ARE VALUED

USING A 30% DISCOUNT RATE.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE BASED ON A 10% OR 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE

EXTRAPOLATED EASILY, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS

TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT

THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE

FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER ASSUMPTION, WHICH MIGHT COUNTERACT OR

MAGNIFY THE SENSITIVITIES.

EXPECTED STATIC-POOL NET CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDE ACTUAL INCURRED LOSSES PLUS

PROJECTED NET CREDIT LOSSES, DIVIDED BY THE ORIGINAL BALANCE OF THE

NOTE 14

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

INVOLVED WITH VIES IN THE FOLLOWING

MANNER.



INVESTMENT BANK  UTILIZES

VIES, SUCH AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER, BY PROVIDING CLIENTS THE

STRUCTURAL FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF INVESTORS RELATING TO

FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE, YIELD AND DESIRED RISKS. THE

FIRM ALSO ACTS AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY TO TAILOR PRODUCTS FOR

INVESTORS. FINALLY,

THE IB SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES THROUGH QSPES, WHICH ARE NOT

CONSIDERED VIES, TO CREATE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AS

FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 ON PAGES 100-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES  PROVIDES TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAL

SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES. THESE SERVICES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE

PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR SERVICES

PROVIDED. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS

UNDER FIN 46

FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.



INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING  PROVIDES INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE FIRMS MUTUAL

FUNDS DEEMED VIES. THE SERVICES PROVIDED ARE SIMILAR TO THE

SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-VIES, AS ASSET MANAGER TO THE FIRMS

MUTUAL FUNDS. IMPB EARNS A FIXED FEE BASED ON ASSETS

MANAGED; SUCH FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS

INDUSTRY-COMPETITIVE. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS AND EXPECTED

LOSSES ARE FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE FUNDS INVESTORS. THE FIRM GENERALLY

DOES NOT HOLD AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THE FUNDS, ALTHOUGH IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, IT MAY HOLD A NOMINAL INTEREST. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, THE FIRMS INTEREST IS NOT CONSIDERED

SIGNIFICANT UNDER FIN 46 FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.



JPMORGAN PARTNERS  JPMP, THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, IS

INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT MAY BE DEEMED VIES. JPMP ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT COMPANY AUDIT GUIDE

(AUDIT GUIDE). THE FASB DEFERRED ADOPTION OF FIN 46 FOR

NON-REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES THAT APPLY THE AUDIT GUIDE. SEE THE

FIN 46 TRANSITION SECTION OF THIS NOTE.



CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES  PRIMARILY UTILIZES SPES TO SECURITIZE

CONSUMER ASSETS; THESE ENTITIES MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 1 ON PAGES 86-87 AND NOTE 13 ON PAGES 100-103 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT, AND THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIES. CFS IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED

WITH VIES AS PART OF ITS MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS. THIS INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES.

(1) SYNTHETIC LEASE TRANSACTIONS, IN WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDES FINANCING

TO A VIE; IN TURN, THE VIE PURCHASES ASSETS, WHICH ARE THEN LEASED BY

THE VIE TO THE FIRMS CUSTOMER; AND (2) STRUCTURING AND ADMINISTERING

INDEPENDENT, MEMBER-OWNED FINANCE ENTITIES FOR COMPANIES WITH DEDICATED

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WHERE THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE SOME LIQUIDITY,

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. CHASE MIDDLE MARKET

EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES. THE VIES THAT THE

FIRM EITHER HAS AN INVESTMENT IN OR LENDS TO NEITHER MEET THE

REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSOLIDATION NOR ARE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR

DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, SINCE THE SIGNIFICANT FIRST-LOSS POSITION IS HELD

BY THIRD PARTIES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THERE ARE

TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES WITH WHICH THE IB

IS INVOLVED.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION. THESE ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

JPMORGAN CHASE SERVES AS THE

ADMINISTRATOR, AND PROVIDES CONTINGENT

LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AND LIMITED CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT, FOR SEVERAL COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUITS. THESE CONDUITS GIVE CLIENTS

ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY IN THE COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKETS BY ALLOWING THEM TO SELL

ASSETS TO THE CONDUIT, WHICH THEN ISSUES

COMMERCIAL PAPER TO INVESTORS TO FUND THE

PURCHASES. THE FIRM DOES NOT SELL ASSETS

TO OR SERVICE THE ASSETS HELD BY THESE

COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUITS. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY

CONDUITS FOR WHICH THE FIRM ACTS AS

ADMINISTRATOR AGGREGATED $11.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND $17.5 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUED IS BACKED BY SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL,

CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO

PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT RECEIVING AT

LEAST AN A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES,

AN F1 RATING.

THE FIRM HAD COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY ON AN ASSET-SPECIFIC BASIS TO

THESE VEHICLES IN AN AMOUNT UP TO $18.0

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND $23.5

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THIRD-PARTY

BANKS HAD COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY

ON AN ASSET-SPECIFIC BASIS TO THESE

VEHICLES IN AN AMOUNT UP TO $700 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND UP TO $900

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

ASSET-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY IS THE PRIMARY

SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE

CONDUITS. IN ADDITION, PROGRAM-WIDE

LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO

THESE VEHICLES IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM

DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET; THESE COMMITMENTS TOTALED $2.6

BILLION AND $2.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY. FOR CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS, JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO PROVIDES

LIMITED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT

TOTALED $1.9 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE APPLIES THE SAME

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS IN MAKING LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS TO CONDUITS AS THE FIRM WOULD

WITH OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW

A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, F1, THE

FIRM COULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

FUNDING UNDER THESE LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS, SINCE COMMERCIAL PAPER

RATED BELOW A-1, P-1 OR F1 WOULD

GENERALLY NOT BE ISSUABLE BY THE

VEHICLE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

FIRM COULD EITHER REPLACE ITSELF AS

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER OR FACILITATE THE

SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS HELD

IN THE VIE IN OTHER MARKETS.

JPMORGAN CHASES MAXIMUM CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO THESE VEHICLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, IS

$18.7 BILLION, AS THE FIRM CANNOT BE

OBLIGATED TO FUND THE ENTIRE NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF ASSET-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY,

PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES AT THE SAME TIME.

HOWEVER, THE FIRM VIEWS ITS CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

TRANSACTIONS AS LIMITED. THIS IS BECAUSE,

FOR THE MOST PART, THE FIRM IS NOT

REQUIRED TO FUND UNDER THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES IF THE ASSETS IN THE VIE ARE IN

DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

ARE SECONDARY TO THE RISK OF FIRST LOSS

PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT OR OTHER THIRD

PARTIES  FOR EXAMPLE, BY THE

OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF THE VIE WITH THE

ASSETS SOLD TO IT.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONSOLIDATED THESE

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS AT

JULY 1, 2003, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46

AND RECORDED THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

THE CONDUITS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET. IN DECEMBER 2003, ONE OF THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WAS RESTRUCTURED

WITH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SECURITIES

ACQUIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

INVESTOR, WHO WILL ABSORB THE MAJORITY OF

THE EXPECTED LOSSES

OF THE CONDUIT. IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUIT, THE FIRM

LEVERAGED AN EXISTING RATING AGENCY MODEL

THAT IS AN INDEPENDENT MARKET STANDARD TO

SIZE THE EXPECTED LOSSES AND CONSIDERED THE

RELATIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF

THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING, JPMORGAN CHASE

DECONSOLIDATED APPROXIMATELY $5.4 BILLION

OF THE VEHICLES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE REMAINING CONDUITS CONTINUE TO BE

CONSOLIDATED ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003: $4.8 BILLION OF

ASSETS RECORDED IN LOANS, AND $1.5

BILLION OF ASSETS RECORDED IN

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM IS

INVOLVED IN STRUCTURING VIE TRANSACTIONS TO

MEET INVESTOR AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM

INTERMEDIATES VARIOUS TYPES OF RISKS

(INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, FIXED INCOME,

EQUITY AND CREDIT), TYPICALLY USING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES

LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE VIES TO

FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION. THE FIRMS

CURRENT EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IS

REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

OR IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE RISKS INHERENT IN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER

CREDIT, MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED.

ASSETS HELD BY CERTAIN CLIENT

AND TRADING FUNCTIONS AND FUNDED BY ISSUING

COMMERCIAL PAPER. INVESTORS PROVIDE

COLLATERAL AND HAVE A FIRST RISK OF LOSS UP

TO THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED. THE

FIRM RETAINS A SECOND-RISK-OF-LOSS POSITION

FOR THESE VEHICLES AND DOES NOT ABSORB A

MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE

VEHICLES. DOCUMENTATION INCLUDES PROVISIONS

INTENDED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO

ENABLE JPMORGAN CHASE TO TERMINATE THE

TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR LOAN

VEHICLE IF THE VALUE OF THE RELEVANT

PORTFOLIO DECLINES BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL.

THE AMOUNT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED

BY THESE VEHICLES TOTALED $5.3 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND $7.2 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. JPMORGAN CHASE WAS

COMMITTED TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THESE

VIES OF UP TO $8.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, AND $12.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS

TO THESE VEHICLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WAS

$5.5 BILLION, WHICH REFLECTS THE NETTING OF

COLLATERAL AND OTHER PROGRAM LIMITS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM STRUCTURES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES IN

WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY-RATED

ASSETS (SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES)

AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE

TO A REFERENCED CREDIT NOT HELD BY THE

VIE. CREDIT-LINKED NOTES ARE ISSUED BY THE

VIE TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED

CREDIT TO THE INVESTORS IN THE VIE.

CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER A VIE

STRUCTURE, SINCE THE CREDIT-LINKED NOTES

GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING

THAN THEY WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY

JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

CONTRACT IS NOT CONSIDERED A SIGNIFICANT

VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE VIE, BECAUSE IT

DOES NOT ABSORB RISK BUT RATHER ADDS RISK

TO THE VEHICLE, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY

ABSORBED BY THE INVESTORS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH

CREDIT-LINKED NOTES VEHICLES WAS NOT

MATERIAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. ASSETS OF

$2.1 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION REPORTED IN

THE TABLE ABOVE WERE RECORDED ON THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO OTHER CONTRACTUAL

RELATIONSHIPS HELD BY THE FIRM THAT RELATE

TO THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE VIE.

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A

SERIES OF SECONDARY MARKET TRUSTS THAT

ALLOW TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS TO FINANCE

THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT

RATES. THE VIE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE,

LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS

BY ISSUING PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES AND INVERSE FLOATING-RATE

CERTIFICATES; THE INVESTORS IN THE INVERSE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE

EXPOSED TO THE RESIDUAL LOSSES OF THE VIE

(THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS). THE FIRM OFTEN

SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT FOR THE VIE

AND PROVIDES LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT THE

REMARKETING; TOTAL LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS

WERE $1.8 BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE FIRM OWNS THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES

THE VIE; TOTAL AMOUNTS CONSOLIDATED WERE

$2.5 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE

REPORTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. IN

CIRCUMSTANCES

WHERE THIRD PARTY INVESTORS OWN THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS

LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY

OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE

MARKET-VALUE TRIGGERS BASED ON THE VALUE

OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND THE

RESIDUAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ALL

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES WAS $4.3 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE STRUCTURES,

ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS, OTHER CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION VEHICLES IN WHICH THE FIRM

TRANSFERS THE RISKS AND RETURNS OF THE

ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE, TYPICALLY DEBT AND

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, TO CLIENTS THROUGH

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRMS NET

EXPOSURE ARISING FROM THESE INTERMEDIATION

TRANSACTIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE

FIRMS CURRENT EXPOSURE TO ALL OF THESE

VEHICLES IS REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN

TRADING ASSETS OR TRADING LIABILITIES, AND

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN

TRADING REVENUE.

FINALLY, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER

PARTIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER,

INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT,

TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS

ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH, AND

INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE BASED UPON

THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS

AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS SIMILARLY TO

ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. FOR

EXAMPLE, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED IN NOTE 31 ON

PAGES 120-123 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT,

WHEREAS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE INCLUDED

WITHIN THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS, DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN

NOTE 29 ON PAGES 117-119 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. FEES RECEIVED WHEN THE FIRM

OPERATES IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY,

SUCH AS UNDERWRITER, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN,

ARE RECORDED IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS.

THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE JPMORGAN

CHASE TO ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED

LOSSES OF THE VIES OR RECEIVE A MAJORITY

OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, AND

THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR

DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.

FIN 46 TRANSITION

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE

IMPLEMENTED FIN 46 FOR VIES CREATED OR

MODIFIED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, IN WHICH

THE FIRM HAS AN INTEREST. EFFECTIVE JULY

1, 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED FIN 46 FOR

ALL VIES ORIGINATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1,

2003, EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MADE

BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, AS

DISCUSSED BELOW. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION

WAS AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE FIRMS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY

$17 BILLION AT JULY 1, 2003, AND $10

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE INCREASE

PRIMARILY RELATED TO FIRM-SPONSORED

MULTI-SELLER ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUITS AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE

FIRMS TRADING AND INVESTMENT FUNCTIONS

HAVE INTERESTS THAT ABSORB A MAJORITY OF

THE EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE STRUCTURES. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN VIES WITH ASSETS OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 THAT HAD BEEN CONSOLIDATED

UNDER PRIOR ACCOUNTING LITERATURE CONTINUE TO BE CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH FIN 46. AS A RESULT OF ITS ADOPTION

OF FIN 46, THE FIRM ALSO DECONSOLIDATED

CERTAIN VEHICLES, PRIMARILY THE

WHOLLY-OWNED DELAWARE STATUTORY BUSINESS

TRUSTS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18 ON

PAGES 110-111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS

INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT MAY BE DEEMED

VIES. THE FASB PERMITTED NONREGISTERED

INVESTMENT COMPANIES TO DEFER

CONSOLIDATION OF VIES WITH WHICH THEY ARE

INVOLVED UNTIL THE PROPOSED STATEMENT OF

POSITION ON THE CLARIFICATION

OF THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY

AUDIT GUIDE IS FINALIZED, WHICH IS

EXPECTED IN MID-2004. FOLLOWING ISSUANCE

OF THE STATEMENT OF POSITION, THE FASB

WILL CONSIDER FURTHER MODIFICATION TO FIN

46 TO PROVIDE AN EXCEPTION FOR COMPANIES

THAT QUALIFY TO APPLY THE REVISED AUDIT

UPON ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE ASSETS,

CERTAIN VIES, THE INITIAL CARRYING AMOUNT

OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION) WAS BASED ON

FAIR VALUE AT JULY 1, 2003, DUE TO LIMITED

HISTORICAL INFORMATION. THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE NET AMOUNT ADDED TO THE

BALANCE SHEET AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY

PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED INTEREST IN THE

NEWLY CONSOLIDATED ENTITY WAS RECOGNIZED

AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING

CHANGE AT JULY 1, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN

A $2 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) REDUCTION TO THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THE FIRM

ALSO RECORDED A $34 MILLION (AFTER-TAX)

REDUCTION IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

RELATED TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY

HELD BY JPMORGAN PARTNERS (JPMP), THE

FIRMS GLOBAL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT

BUSINESS SEGMENT. JPMP INVESTS IN BUYOUTS,

GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN

THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES.

ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS,

IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY JPMP, ARE

CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AT FAIR VALUE. REALIZED AND UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN

VALUE ARE REPORTED IN PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS

(LOSSES) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE GAIN OR LOSS

OCCURS.

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED

BASED ON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST

TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH

THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION,

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY JPMPS SENIOR

INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF

FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO

ASSESS IMPAIRMENT  INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND

FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

VALUATIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN

MARKET OUTLOOK AND CHANGES IN THE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD BY JPMP.

JPMP ALSO HOLDS PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

GENERALLY OBTAINED THROUGH THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MARKED

TO MARKET AT THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUE. TO

DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE

INVESTMENTS, JPMP INCORPORATES THE USE OF

DISCOUNTS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT

THAT IT CANNOT IMMEDIATELY REALIZE OR

ADOPTED SFAS 142, RECLASSIFYING CERTAIN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM GOODWILL TO OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT

OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142.

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE

REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT (WHICH IS ONE LEVEL

BELOW THE FIVE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 34 ON PAGES 126-127 OF

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

(MSRS), WHICH REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR

RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS;

MAKING TAX AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS; MONITORING

DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND

REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF THE

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE AMOUNT CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PAID TO THIRD PARTIES TO

ACQUIRE MSRS OR IS BASED ON FAIR VALUE IF RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION

OF MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING A DISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,

CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY

RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL

PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE

FAIR VALUES ARE SUPPORTABLE AND REASONABLE.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS MSRS AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 140. MSRS ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME

RECEIVED IN PROPORTION TO, AND OVER THE PERIOD OF THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET

SERVICING INCOME STREAM OF, THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS. FOR PURPOSES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

OF EVALUATING AND MEASURING IMPAIRMENT OF

MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIES ITS PORTFOLIO ON

THE BASIS OF THE PREDOMINANT RISK

CHARACTERISTICS: LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST

RATE. ANY INDICATED IMPAIRMENT IS

RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE

THROUGH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN

INDIVIDUAL STRATUM EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM EVALUATES OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT BY REVIEWING CHANGES IN

MORTGAGE AND OTHER MARKET INTEREST RATES

OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS AND THEN

DETERMINES AN INTEREST RATE SCENARIO TO

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF THE MSRS GROSS

CARRYING VALUE AND THE RELATED VALUATION

ALLOWANCE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE

RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ANY

GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND RELATED VALUATION

ALLOWANCE AMOUNT THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE,

BASED UPON THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR

EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. THE FIRM

OFFSETS THIS INTEREST RATE RISK BY

DESIGNATING CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (E.G., A

COMBINATION OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS AND FLOORS

THAT PRODUCES AN INTEREST RATE PROFILE

OPPOSITE TO THE DESIGNATED RISK OF THE

HEDGED MSRS) AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

SPECIFIED MSRS UNDER SFAS 133. SFAS 133

HEDGE ACCOUNTING ALLOWS THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE HEDGED

MSRS TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH EARNINGS IN

THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE CHANGE IN VALUE

OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES IS RECOGNIZED

THROUGH EARNINGS. BOTH OF THESE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES

AND RELATED INCOME.

WHEN APPLYING SFAS 133, THE LOANS

UNDERLYING THE MSRS BEING HEDGED ARE

STRATIFIED INTO SPECIFIC SFAS 133

SIMILAR-ASSET GROUPINGS THAT POSSESS

SIMILAR INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT RISK

EXPOSURES. THE DOCUMENTED HEDGE PERIOD FOR

THE FIRM IS DAILY. DAILY ADJUSTMENTS ARE

PERFORMED TO INCORPORATE NEW OR TERMINATED

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND TO MODIFY THE

AMOUNT OF THE CORRESPONDING SIMILAR ASSET

GROUPING THAT IS BEING HEDGED. THE FIRM

HAS DESIGNATED CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATE (LIBOR) AS THE HEDGED RISK.

IN DESIGNATING THE BENCHMARK INTEREST

RATE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE IMPACT THAT

THE CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK RATE HAS ON

THE PREPAYMENT SPEED ESTIMATES IN

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS.

THE FIRM PERFORMS BOTH PROSPECTIVE AND

RETROSPECTIVE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

EVALUATIONS, USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS,

TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED

BY

COMPARING THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE

MSRS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BENCHMARK

INTEREST RATES TO THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE

OF THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE

NOTE 28 ON PAGES 116-117 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AFS SECURITIES ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE

RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS. THESE INSTRUMENTS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS STAND-ALONE

INSTRUMENTS, BECAUSE AFS SECURITIES DO NOT

QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133.

ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AFS SECURITIES UNDER SFAS 115, WITH

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES);

INTEREST INCOME ON THE AFS SECURITIES IS

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN NET INTEREST

INCOME. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS

SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN

NONHEDGE DERIVATIVES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN

DESIGNATED BY MANAGEMENT IN SFAS 133 HEDGE

RELATIONSHIPS, ARE USED TO MANAGE THE

ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS AND ARE

RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED

INCOME.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES MSR

ACTIVITY AND RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR THE

DATES INDICATED. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE KEY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED

WITH CAUTION. AS THE FIGURES INDICATE,

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON A 10% AND

20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY

CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE

RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE

ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE

MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE,

THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR

ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER

ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE

FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER,

WHICH MIGHT MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE

SENSITIVITIES.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS THE

EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS

EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. CHANGES

IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ARE THE RESULT

OF THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT OR THE

RECOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DUE TO CHANGES IN

MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE PERIOD. THE

THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES JPMORGAN CHASES EXPOSURE TO

THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. INCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES, THE RANGE OF MODIFIED RATES IN EFFECT AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS 0.14% TO 10.95%, VERSUS THE CONTRACTUAL

(G)

INCLUDES $1.1 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING ZERO-COUPON NOTES AT DECEMBER 31,

2003. THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THESE NOTES AT THEIR RESPECTIVE

MATURITIES IS $4.6 BILLION.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST

RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS 4.71%

AND 5.51% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO MODIFY

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE

UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY

INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF

ITS DEBT ISSUES. THE USE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS INTEREST

EXPENSE ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT. THE

EFFECTS OF RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

WAS 2.79% AND 3.42% AS OF DECEMBER 31,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FIRM HAD

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED WHOLLY-OWNED

DELAWARE STATUTORY BUSINESS TRUSTS

(ISSUER TRUSTS) THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED

PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE

FIRMS JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE

THESE ISSUER TRUSTS WERE CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE; THE

THE CAPTION GUARANTEED PREFERRED

AND THE RETAINED COMMON CAPITAL SECURITIES

OF THE ISSUER TRUSTS WERE ELIMINATED

AGAINST THE FIRMS INVESTMENT IN THE

ISSUER TRUSTS. DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE

PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE RECORDED AS

INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46,

JPMORGAN CHASE DECONSOLIDATED ALL THE

ISSUER TRUSTS. AS A RESULT, THE JUNIOR

EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

(EPS) IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. BASIC EPS

IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME

APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK BY THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS

COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHOD AS BASIC

EPS, BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING REFLECT THE POTENTIAL

DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE

SECURITIES OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE

COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED

INTO COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME AVAILABLE

FOR COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME COMPUTATION

FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED EPS AS JPMORGAN

NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE

USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD

REQUIRED BY SFAS 109 TO PROVIDE INCOME

TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS

REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK

AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR EACH TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX

RATES THAT JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN

EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME

AND EXPENSE ARE TO BE REALIZED. JPMORGAN

CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES

THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT

EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

TO THE AMOUNT JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE

REALIZED.

THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH

RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE

AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES

DEPOSITED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BANK

SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE

BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION IN

2003 AND $2.2 BILLION IN 2002.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW

PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED

IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED LOANS

TO JPMORGAN CHASE OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES

GENERALLY ARE LIMITED

TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL

CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT

OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE

BANKING SUB-

SIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL. JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS AFFILIATES WERE WELL WITHIN

THESE LIMITS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES

INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS)

ARE DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK AND THE OTHER BANKING AND

NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE.

IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET

FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE

CURRENCY (OCC) AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) HAVE

AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT

THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT

ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF,

IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION,

PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2004 AND 2003, JPMORGAN

CHASES BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN

THE AGGREGATE, $4.4 BILLION AND $1.3

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT

BANKING REGULATORS. DIVIDEND CAPACITY IN

2004 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKS

EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS

ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S.

REGULATORS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $3.5 BILLION

AND $2.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

SECURITIES WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $3.1

BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS

FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES

BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 26

CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED

CAPITAL: CORE CAPITAL (REFERRED TO AS TIER

1 CAPITAL) AND SUPPLEMENTARY CAPITAL

(REFERRED TO AS TIER 2 CAPITAL). TIER 1

CAPITAL INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND

MINORITY INTEREST LESS GOODWILL AND OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF

PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1,

LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS

QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, THE AGGREGATE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A

CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS, LESS INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF

TIER 1 AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2)

CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL

AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE

DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE

ADJUSTED ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE

TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD

RESULT IN ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. BANK

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE

PRIMARY REGULATORS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, JPMORGAN

CHASE AND EACH OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES

MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH

WAS SUBJECT AND IS NOT AWARE OF ANY

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THAT WOULD ALTER THIS

CLASSIFICATION. THE FIRM REVISED ITS

CALCULATION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS DURING

THE THIRD-QUARTER OF 2003; CAPITAL RATIOS

FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO JUNE 2003 HAVE NOT

BEEN RECALCULATED.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR

RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF

PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY

LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES OR WHERE

THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OR

INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES, THE

FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE

EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE PENDING MATTERS

WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR

WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS RELATED TO EACH

PENDING MATTER WILL BE. SUBJECT TO THE

FOREGOING CAVEAT, JPMORGAN CHASE

ANTICIPATES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL

AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT

LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF

THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND

INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST

IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE FIRM. HOWEVER, THE

OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR PROCEEDING OR THE

IMPOSITION OF A PARTICULAR FINE OR PENALTY

MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OPERATING

RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD DEPENDING

UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE

LOSS OR LIABILITY AND THE LEVEL OF THE

FIRMS INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

NOTE 28

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO

INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A

DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED FROM ITS REFERENCE

TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR COMBINATION

OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST

RATE PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE

MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR ITS

CUSTOMERS, AND ALSO IS AN END USER OF

DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE FIRMS

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS.

SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138 AND SFAS

149, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED

IN OTHER CONTRACTS USED FOR TRADING AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES. ALL DERIVATIVES,

WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR HEDGING

RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR

VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE

OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE

CONTRACT IS FOR TRADING PURPOSES OR HAS

BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. THE

MAJORITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES DERIVATIVES

ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE

FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVES AS AN END-USER

TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE

INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED

BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS OR MEET

LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. BOTH

TRADING AND END-USER DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS

AND TRADING LIABILITIES.

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES MUST BE CONSIDERED

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED.

EACH DERIVATIVE MUST BE DESIGNATED AS A

HEDGE, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY,

INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF THE HEDGING

INSTRUMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK

EXPOSURE, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE

ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND

RETROSPECTIVELY.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING

HEDGED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM

CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE

BASIS OF THE ITEM AND IS AMORTIZED TO

EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. FOR

QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED CASH

FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE

IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE

HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE

CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE

HEDGED OCCUR, CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL

HEDGE STRATEGY. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS

DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR

ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY

RELATED DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR QUALIFYING NET

INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE REVALUATION

OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT

INSTRUMENT ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES

PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE

LONG-TERM DEBT, LOANS, AFS SECURITIES AND

MSRS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE THE MOST

COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED TO

MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK,

CONVERTING FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES TO A FLOATING RATE. INTEREST

RATE OPTIONS AND SWAPTIONS ARE ALSO USED

IN COMBINATION WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO

HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS MSRS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF HEDGING, SEE

NOTE 16 ON PAGE 108 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS

CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE

HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST

INCOME, MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME

AND OTHER REVENUE. JPMORGAN CHASE DID NOT

RECOGNIZE ANY GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2003

ON FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY

AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY

IN CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS,

PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND

ANTICIPATED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FUTURES, OPTIONS AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE THE MOST COMMON

INSTRUMENTS USED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON FUTURE EARNINGS.

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS EXPECTED

THAT $124 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) OF NET

INCOME AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WILL BE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH

OF TIME OVER WHICH FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

ARE HEDGED IS 10 YEARS, RELATED TO CORE

LENDING AND BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

IN 2001, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 RESULTED

IN AN AFTER-TAX REDUCTION TO NET INCOME OF

$25 MILLION AND AN AFTER-TAX REDUCTION TO

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $36 MILLION.

DUE TO SFAS 133, JPMORGAN CHASE CHANGED

CERTAIN HEDGING STRATEGIES AND ELECTED NOT

TO DESIGNATE SOME DERIVATIVES UTILIZED TO

MANAGE ECONOMIC EXPOSURE AS ACCOUNTING

HEDGES. FOR EXAMPLE, TO MODERATE ITS USE

OF DERIVATIVES, THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS

BEGAN USING AFS SECURITIES AS ECONOMIC

HEDGES OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS.

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS

CREDIT RISK ARE RECORDED IN TRADING

REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN

QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES OF

LOANS AND COMMITMENTS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS

NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL

AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT

RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW DOWN THE

OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE

COUNTER-PARTY WERE TO SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO

PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT

OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A

RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF

FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A GUARANTOR

RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A

GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. FIN

45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT

CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A

GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED ON: (A) CHANGES IN

AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY

SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY, OR (B) A

THIRD PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A

SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS

THE FOLLOWING OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING

ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN

45: CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS,

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL

GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING

INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE

DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, NEWLY ISSUED OR

MODIFIED GUARANTEES THAT ARE NOT

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT

THEIR FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN

ISSUING THE GUARANTEE AT INCEPTION IS

TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE

OF THE FUTURE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE

UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS RECORDED

THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN

OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, IT

IS APPLIED TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE

RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS, AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT

INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS FEES

AND COMMISSIONS OVER THE LIFE OF THE

GUARANTEE CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY RELATED TO GUARANTEES RECORDED

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, EXCLUDING THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS

APPROXIMATELY $59 MILLION.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE

AGREEMENTS TO LEND ONLY WHEN A CUSTOMER

HAS COMPLIED WITH PREDETERMINED

CONDITIONS, AND THEY GENERALLY EXPIRE ON

FIXED DATES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS INCLUDES $155 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, RELATED TO UNFUNDED

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT. THE MAJORITY

OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT

GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT

FOR CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF

$21 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THESE

AGREEMENTS ARE PRIMARILY USED AS A

MECHANISM TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO SPES. OF

THE $21 BILLION OF ASSET PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, $18

BILLION RELATED TO MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

AND STRUCTURED COMMERCIAL LOAN VEHICLES

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 103-106 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE $6

BILLION OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO

MULTI-SELLER ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUITS CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FIN 46 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AS THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS OF THE CONDUITS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS CAN BE

EXERCISED AT ANY TIME BY THE SPES

ADMINISTRATOR, WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE A

TRIGGERING EVENT TO OCCUR. TRIGGERING

EVENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A

NEED FOR LIQUIDITY, A MARKET VALUE DECLINE

OF THE ASSETS OR A DOWNGRADE IN THE RATING

OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THESE AGREEMENTS

MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET

FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE

ASSETS FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT PROVIDING A

GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE

REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE

AGREEMENT. IN MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY

CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SPE MITIGATE

THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON THESE

AGREEMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON COMMERCIAL LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS

WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL

GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING

COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO

GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO

A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS,

SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND

FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS AND

SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. MORE THAN 80% OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE

YEARS. THE FIRM

TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO RECOVER FROM THE

CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES; IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD

CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO

SUPPORT THESE GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FIRM HELD

COLLATERAL RELATING TO $7.7 BILLION OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS INCLUDED $167 MILLION RELATED

TO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL

GUARANTEES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HOLDS CUSTOMERS SECURITIES

UNDER CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS. AT TIMES,

THESE SECURITIES ARE LOANED TO THIRD

PARTIES, AND THE FIRM ISSUES SECURITIES

LENDING INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO THE

CUSTOMER THAT PROTECT THE CUSTOMER AGAINST

THE RISK OF LOSS IF THE THIRD PARTY FAILS

TO RETURN THE SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM

GENERALLY OBTAINS FROM THE THIRD PARTY

CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL

WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE

VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FIRM HELD $146.7

BILLION IN COLLATERAL IN SUPPORT OF THESE

AGREEMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO

INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE

A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE

IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF

TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT

MAY ALSO INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE,

WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE

CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE, THUS, SUCH A

CLAUSE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE

A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TERMINATION

CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT SUCH

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER

INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES WHEN IT SELLS

A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY,

PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES THAT

THIRD PARTY FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE

TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE

SALE. SEE BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION

REGARDING THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE

INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS

WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT

MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT

YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF

LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13 ON

PAGES 100-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE

FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES THAT CERTAIN SECURITIZED LOANS

MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MAY

BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR

INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER OF THE LOANS

AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF SUCH

REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. GENERALLY,

THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE

FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER SUCH

REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION

PROVISIONS WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT

AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD BY SUCH

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003, PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS

AND CERTAIN EXPENSES. THE POTENTIAL LOSS

DUE TO SUCH REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNITY IS

MITIGATED BY THE DUE DILIGENCE THE FIRM

PERFORMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ASSETS COMPLY

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

118

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED ON SUCH

REPURCHASES AND/OR INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE

BEEN INSIGNIFICANT, AND THEREFORE

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF MATERIAL

LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN CONNECTION WITH CHASE CARDMEMBER

SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A 50% PARTNER WITH

ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT VENTURE, KNOWN

AS CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES (THE JOINT

VENTURE) THAT PROVIDES MERCHANT

PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE JOINT VENTURE IS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE

FOR PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES

TRANSACTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE

BETWEEN THE CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF

A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS

FAVOR, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL CREDIT OR

REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND

CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE

MERCHANT. IF THE JOINT VENTURE IS UNABLE

TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT,

THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR

THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE

CARDMEMBER. THE JOINT VENTURE MITIGATES

THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING SETTLEMENT OR

OBTAINING ESCROW DEPOSITS FROM CERTAIN

MERCHANTS. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

THAT: 1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND

IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR

A REFUND; 2) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT

HAVE SUFFICIENT WITHHOLDINGS OR ESCROW

DEPOSITS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND

3) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE

SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE

CUSTOMER REFUNDS, THE FIRM WOULD BE LIABLE

TO REFUND THE CARDHOLDER IN PROPORTION TO

ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

JOINT VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT

LOSSES OF $2.0 MILLION ON $260 BILLION OF

AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $242

MILLION OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES

THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND

THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE JOINT VENTURE,

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE WOULD NOT

BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CREDIT

LOSS ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT

VENTURE; THEREFORE, THE FIRM HAS NOT

RECORDED ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IN

EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE

JOINT VENTURE.

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES

AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS.

MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS

REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE

OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION

AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER

MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATION VARIES WITH

DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. IT MAY BE LIMITED

TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING

MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF

THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTION TO

A MEMBERS GUARANTY FUND, OR, IN A FEW

CASES, IT MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE

UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE

THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE

CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM

THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED

ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT

EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED

ABOVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A

COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN

45. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT

FAIR VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE

WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM

TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE OPTION HOLDER

AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE

IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES

THAT EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON

A COUNTER-PARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF

ASSETS. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO BE

GUARANTEES WAS $50 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003. THE FIRM REDUCES ITS EXPOSURES

TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO

OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS OR BY ENTERING

INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK

RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR

VALUE RELATED TO

THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLE OF $163 MILLION AND A

DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $333 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND

CREDIT DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH SETTLEMENT

AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR

THE BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION TO OWN THE

REFERENCE ASSET. THE FIRM DOES NOT

CONSIDER THESE CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES

AS DESCRIBED IN FIN 45.

NOTE 30

CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A

NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE

SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE

SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE

THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS

SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT RISK PORTFOLIO TO

ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS AND

TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED

NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS COMMERCIAL

PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE

PRIMARILY EVALUATED BY INDUSTRY, AND ALSO

BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE PRIMARILY

EVALUATED BY PRODUCT, AND BY U.S.

GEOGRAPHIC REGION.

NOTE 31

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT

COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT

TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER

THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION SALE.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY

MAY DIFFER BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT

AND/OR ITS USE IN A TRADING OR INVESTING

STRATEGY. GENERALLY, THE MEASUREMENT

FRAMEWORK RECORDED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND AS PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME



AT COST (LESS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS), WITH CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE NOT RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT DISCLOSED IN

THE NOTES THERETO



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE

THE FIRM HAS A WELL-ESTABLISHED AND

WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING

FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED

PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR

INDEPENDENT INFORMATION AS INPUTS TO THE

VALUATION MODEL. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY

BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO

REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY,

LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND

ARE BASED ON DEFINED METHODOLOGIES THAT

ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE

(OR PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE,

THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS.

MARKET PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO A AA CREDIT

RATING: THUS, ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT

QUALITY. AN ADJUSTMENT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY AND TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.

WITHOUT THIS ADJUSTMENT, DERIVATIVE POSITIONS WOULD NOT BE

APPROPRIATELY VALUED.



LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE

TO OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES

IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE) MARKETS. THUS, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR

RISK OF LOSS DUE TO A LACK OF LIQUIDITY ARE APPLIED TO THOSE POSITIONS

TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF

UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION BASED UPON THE LIQUIDITY OR

ILLIQUIDITY, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INSTRUMENT

TRADES AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRM MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT;

(2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE; AND

(3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

120

TABLE OF CONTENTS



CONCENTRATION VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE

COST OF UNWINDING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET SIZE RISK POSITIONS. THE

COST IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS

LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A POSITION

DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL. AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD NEEDED TO

REDUCE, WITHOUT MARKET DISRUPTION, A POSITION TO A NONCONCENTRATED

LEVEL IS GENERALLY BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE POSITION TO THE

AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME OF THAT POSITION. WITHOUT THESE

ADJUSTMENTS, LARGER POSITIONS WOULD BE VALUED AT A PRICE GREATER THAN

THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FIRM COULD EXIT THE POSITIONS.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED

ON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE CONTROLLED

BY A PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP INDEPENDENT

OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION. ECONOMIC

SUBSTANTIATION OF MODELS, PRICES, MARKET

INPUTS AND REVENUE THROUGH PRICE/INPUT

TESTING, AS WELL AS BACKTESTING, IS DONE

TO VALIDATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ANY CHANGES TO THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THE CHANGES ARE

JUSTIFIED.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY PRODUCE A

FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE

INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR

REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES.

FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE

OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD

RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL

NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM

THE SCOPE OF SFAS 107. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS

107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM

RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH

ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS,

COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT

INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS.

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS,

IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS

NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING CAPTIONS DESCRIBE THE

METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED, BY

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, TO DETERMINE FAIR

VALUE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

THE FIRM CONSIDERS FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN

FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT COST 

INCLUDING CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS,

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES BORROWED,

SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED

INTEREST RECEIVABLE  TO APPROXIMATE

THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES, DUE TO

THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY

NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK.

ASSETS WHERE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS FROM COST

JPMORGAN CHASES DEBT, EQUITY AND

DERIVATIVE TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE

CARRIED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHEN AVAILABLE, ARE

USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF

TRADING INSTRUMENTS. IF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FAIR

VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING

MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF INSTRUMENTS WITH

SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES

PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES

PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE

TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND AS

SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM

ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED RESALE AGREEMENTS

AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED

MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH FLOWS ARE

DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET

RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

SECURITIES

FAIR VALUES OF ACTIVELY TRADED

SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE

SECONDARY MARKET, WHILE THE FAIR VALUES

FOR NONACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE

BASED ON INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE FOR DERIVATIVES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING.



POSITION VALUATION, PRINCIPALLY BASED ON LIQUID MARKET PRICING AS

EVIDENCED BY EXCHANGE-TRADED PRICES, BROKER-DEALER QUOTATIONS OR

RELATED INPUT PARAMETERS WHICH ASSUME ALL COUNTERPARTIES HAVE THE SAME

CREDIT RATING;



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESULTING PORTFOLIO VALUATION,

TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES; AND



OTHER FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LIQUIDITY,

CONCENTRATION AND OTHER FACTORS.

LOANS

FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS IS DETERMINED USING

METHODOLOGIES SUITABLE FOR EACH TYPE OF

LOAN.



FAIR VALUE FOR THE COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON THE

ASSESSMENT OF THE TWO MAIN RISK COMPONENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO: CREDIT AND

INTEREST. THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR

VALUE OF COMMERCIAL LOANS.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2003 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE

FINANCINGS) AND 1 - 4 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, FOR WHICH MARKET

RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE, ARE BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, ADJUSTED FOR PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES

USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE CURRENT RATES OFFERED BY

COMMERCIAL BANKS. FOR 1 - 4 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, SECONDARY

MARKET YIELDS FOR COMPARABLE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ADJUSTED FOR

RISK, ARE USED.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED ON DISCOUNTED

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES,

SINCE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ALREADY REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CREDIT

RISK.



THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS

IS GENERALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND PRICES OF SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. OTHERWISE, IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE

FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT

RISK; THAT RISK IS DISCOUNTED, USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH

MATURITY THAT INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

OTHER ASSETS

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MSRS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE

METHODOLOGY FOR PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 106 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE

METHODOLOGY FOR MSRS, SEE NOTE 16 ON

PAGES 107-109 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE

DISCLOSED FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO

STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND

CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO

THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES NOT

ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT

FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, OTHER

BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND

ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS CONSIDERED TO

APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING

VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

ARE ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS

BASED ON THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL

MATURITIES OF FUNDS HAVING SIMILAR

INTEREST RATES AND SIMILAR MATURITIES.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES

SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE

TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND AS

SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM

ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS WITH

LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH

FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE

MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY

CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS) ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE, AND AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT

MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ALSO INCLUDES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS WITH LONG-DATED

MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET

RATES.

LONG-TERM DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING

THE GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST

DEBENTURES, IS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET

RATES AND IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES

CREDIT QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

BASED ON THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

CONSUMER COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

BASED ON THE PRIMARY MARKET PRICES TO

ORIGINATE NEW COMMITMENTS. IT IS THE

CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES

THAT PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR

VALUE OF THESE COMMITMENTS.

ON THIS BASIS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

SEGMENT INFORMATION

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE

MAJOR BUSINESSES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE

SEGMENTED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER

SERVED, AND REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS EVALUATED BY

MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SHAREHOLDER VALUE

ADDED (SVA) AND OPERATING EARNINGS AS

ITS PRINCIPAL MEASURES OF SEGMENT

PROFITABILITY. FOR A DEFINITION OF

THESE MEASUREMENTS, SEE THE GLOSSARY OF

TERMS ON PAGES 130-131 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

OPERATING REVENUE AND EXPENSE DIRECTLY

ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED

IN DETERMINING THE SEGMENTS OPERATING

EARNINGS. GUIDELINES EXIST FOR ALLOCATING

TO THE SEGMENTS EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT

DIRECTLY INCURRED BY THEM, SUCH AS

CORPORATE OVERHEAD. IN ADDITION,

MANAGEMENT HAS DEVELOPED A RISK-ADJUSTED

CAPITAL METHODOLOGY THAT QUANTIFIES THE

DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK  CREDIT, MARKET,

OPERATIONAL, BUSINESS AND PRIVATE EQUITY 

WITHIN THE VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND ASSIGNS

CAPITAL ACCORDINGLY. EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CREDIT COSTS,

INCLUDING ACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS AND

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A

CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES

MORTGAGED-BACKED SECURITIES (MBSS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS

(CMOS) ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE

ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A

CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS FOR MBSS AND

CMOS.

(B)

THE AVERAGE YIELD IS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE

YEAR. YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF

RELATED DERIVATIVES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF

PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(C)

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF STATE AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES

ISSUED BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, CMOS OF PRIVATE

ISSUERS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

(D)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE

ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, SEE NOTE 9 ON PAGE 96. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES

AND OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $42,474 MILLION AND $17,060

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WAS $476 MILLION.

THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS

AGENCIES WERE THE ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE

SECURITIES EXCEEDED 10% OF JPMORGAN

CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING

THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FFIEC REVISED GUIDELINES,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES WERE INCLUDED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE

BEGINNING IN 2001.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN

WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER

OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED 0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED.

THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN EXPOSURES

THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC

AND SEC METHODOLOGIES RELATE TO THE

TREATMENTS OF LOCAL COUNTRY EXPOSURE AND

TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN
