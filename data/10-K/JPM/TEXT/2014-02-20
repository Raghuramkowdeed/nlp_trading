IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY. UNDER THE J.P. MORGAN AND CHASE BRANDS, THE FIRM SERVES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. AND MANY OF THE WORLD’S MOST PROMINENT CORPORATE, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

”), A NATIONAL BANK WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN

23

STATES, AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“CHASE BANK USA, N.A.”), A NATIONAL BANK THAT IS THE FIRM’S CREDIT CARD–ISSUING BANK.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (“JPMORGAN SECURITIES”), THE FIRM’S U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS. ONE OF THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (“U.K.”) IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC (FORMERLY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD.), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

THE FIRM’S WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM.

JPMORGAN CHASE

MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”).

FOUR

MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT. THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESS IS THE CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING SEGMENT. THE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING, AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENTS COMPRISE THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

64

AND IN NOTE 33 ON PAGES

334–337.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, INVESTMENT MANAGERS, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION AND PRICE. COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS,

JPMORGAN CHASE

COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED AND, IN SOME CASES, FAILED. THIS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONS

OLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTEN

SE AS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES OR THAT OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT RULES AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAN THE FIRM.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS.

REGULATORY REFORM

: ON JULY 21, 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”), WHICH IS INTENDED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THE DODD-FRANK ACT INSTRUCTS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO CONDUCT APPROXIMATELY 285 RULE-MAKINGS AND 130 STUDIES AND REPORTS. THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES INCLUDE THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”); THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”); THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE “FEDERAL

1

PART I

RESERVE”); THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (THE “OCC”); THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE “FDIC”); THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION (THE “CFPB”); AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE “FSOC”). AS A RESULT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT RULE-MAKING AND OTHER REGULATORY REFORMS, THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE IN REGULATION AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY IN ASSESSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE REGULATORY CHANGES IT IS FACING, AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING ALL THE NEW REGULATIONS, WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, BEST MEETING THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, THE FIRM CANNOT CURRENTLY QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “RISK FACTORS” ON PAGES

9–18

. CERTAIN OF THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”) AND STRESS TESTING

. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL RULES REGARDING THE SUBMISSION OF CAPITAL PLANS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE. PURSUANT TO THESE RULES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OCC ISSUED RULES REQUIRING THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OF ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO PERFORM STRESS TESTS UNDER ONE STRESS SCENARIO CREATED BY THE FIRM AS WELL AS THREE SCENARIOS (BASELINE, ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE) MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS TO THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CCAR AND STRESS TESTING” ON PAGES

5–6.



RESOLUTION PLAN.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED, PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE AND COMPANIES DESIGNATED AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BY THE FSOC TO SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC A PLAN FOR RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (A “RESOLUTION PLAN”). IN JANUARY 2012, THE FDIC ALSO ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE TO SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FDIC A PLAN FOR RESOLUTION UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (THE “FDIA”) IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE. THE FIRM’S INITIAL RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS WERE FILED BY JULY 1, 2012; ANNUAL UPDATES TO THESE RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE BY JULY 1 EACH YEAR (ALTHOUGH THE 2013 PLANS WERE PERMITTED TO BE FILED IN OCTOBER 2013).



DERIVATIVES

. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF ITS DERIVATIVES BUSINESS (INCLUDING CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS,

CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE TRADED ON REGULATED TRADING PLATFORMS) AND HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION. FURTHER, SOME OF THE RULES FOR DERIVATIVES APPLY EXTRATERRITORIALLY TO U.S. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH CLIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, COMMENCING JULY 2015, CERTAIN DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS NOW EXECUTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THE EFFECT OF THESE RULES ISSUED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT WILL NECESSITATE BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS THE FIRM, TO SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURE THEIR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, INCLUDING BY CHANGING THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH THEIR DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE “EU”), THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION (“EMIR”) AND THE REVISION OF THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE (“MIFID II”) WILL RESULT IN COMPARABLE, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN REGULATORY REGIME FOR DERIVATIVES. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE U.S. AND EU REQUIREMENTS, AND THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN THEM, PRESENT CHALLENGES AND RISKS TO THE STRUCTURE AND OPERATING MODEL OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES.



VOLCKER RULE

. THE FIRM WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 619 OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROVISIONS PROHIBITING PROPRIETARY TRADING AND RESTRICTING THE ACTIVITIES INVOLVING PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUNDS (THE “VOLCKER RULE”). ON DECEMBER 10, 2013, REGULATORS ADOPTED FINAL REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE. UNDER THE FINAL RULES, “PROPRIETARY TRADING” IS DEFINED AS THE TRADING OF SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES, OR FUTURES (OR OPTIONS ON ANY OF THE FOREGOING) AS PRINCIPAL, WHERE SUCH TRADING IS PRINCIPALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHORT-TERM RESALE, BENEFITING FROM ACTUAL OR EXPECTED SHORT-TERM PRICE MOVEMENTS AND REALIZING SHORT-TERM ARBITRAGE PROFITS OR HEDGES OF SUCH POSITIONS. IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH PERMISSIBLE FROM IMPERMISSIBLE PRINCIPAL RISK TAKING, THE FINAL RULES REQUIRE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPLEX COMPLIANCE REGIME THAT INCLUDES THE MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING OF SEVEN METRICS. THE FINAL RULES SPECIFICALLY ALLOW MARKET-MAKING-RELATED ACTIVITY, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT-ISSUED SECURITIES TRADING AND CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM HAS CEASED ALL PROHIBITED PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM MUST CONFORM ITS REMAINING ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS TO THE VOLCKER RULE BY JULY 21, 2015.



MONEY MARKET FUND REFORM

. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FSOC AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (THE “FSB”) ISSUED SEPARATE PROPOSALS REGARDING MONEY MARKET FUND REFORM. PURSUANT TO SECTION 120 OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FSOC PUBLISHED PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE SEC PROCEED WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER POSSIBILITIES, REQUIRING THAT MONEY MARKET FUNDS ADOPT A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE, MANDATING A CAPITAL BUFFER AND REQUIRING A HOLD-BACK ON REDEMPTIONS FOR

2

CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS. ON JUNE 5, 2013, THE SEC APPROVED THE PUBLICATION OF PROPOSED STRUCTURAL REFORMS OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THE PROPOSAL CONSIDERED TWO REFORM ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION: (I) REQUIRING PRIME AND TAX-EXEMPT INSTITUTIONAL MONEY MARKET FUNDS TO “FLOAT” THEIR NET ASSET VALUES OR (II) REQUIRING ALL NON-GOVERNMENTAL MONEY MARKET FUNDS TO IMPOSE LIQUIDITY FEES OF UP TO 2% AND TO HAVE THE OPTION TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND REDEMPTIONS (OR “GATE” THE MONEY MARKET FUND) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED EVENTS INDICATING THAT THE FUND MAY BE UNDER STRESS. IT IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE SEC WILL ADOPT FINAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN 2014. THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (THE “FSB”) HAS ENDORSED AND PUBLISHED FOR PUBLIC CONSULTATION 15 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS PROPOSED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF SECURITIES COMMISSIONS, INCLUDING REQUIRING MONEY MARKET FUNDS TO ADOPT A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE.  IN ADDITION, IN SEPTEMBER 2013 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (THE “EC”) RELEASED A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW REGULATION ON MONEY MARKET FUNDS IN THE EU. THE EC PROPOSED TWO OPTIONS FOR STABLE NET ASSET VALUE MONEY MARKET FUNDS: EITHER (I) MAINTAIN A CAPITAL BUFFER OF AT LEAST THREE PERCENT OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR (II) FLOAT THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE MONEY MARKET FUND. THE EC PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY BEING REVIEWED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF MEMBER STATES AS CO-LEGISLATORS, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROVED IN 2014. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES, SEE “SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES” ON PAGES

8–9.



CAPITAL

. IN OCTOBER 2013, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED THE INTERIM FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING BASEL III IN THE U.S. UNDER THESE RULES THE TREATMENT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES WILL BE PHASED OUT FROM INCLUSION AS TIER 1 CAPITAL, BUT INCLUDED AS TIER 2 CAPITAL, BEGINNING IN 2014 THROUGH THE END OF 2015 AND PHASED OUT FROM INCLUSION AS TIER 2 CAPITAL BEGINNING IN 2016 THROUGH THE END OF 2021. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FSB ANNOUNCED THAT CERTAIN GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (“GSIBS”) WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, ABOVE THE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY MINIMUM, IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 2.5%, DEPENDING UPON THE BANK’S SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC ISSUED FINAL RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING RATINGS ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPUTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS” ON PAGES

4-5.



FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND ASSESSMENTS.

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENT RATE CHANGED. THIS RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THE FIRM’S

BANK SUBSIDIARIES PAY ANNUALLY TO THE FDIC. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “DEPOSIT INSURANCE” ON PAGE

6.



CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ESTABLISHED THE CFPB AS A NEW REGULATORY AGENCY. THE CFPB HAS AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE CFPB HAS EXAMINATION AUTHORITY OVER LARGE BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., WITH RESPECT TO THE BANKS’ CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE CFPB ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 10, 2014. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CFPB AND OTHER CONSUMER REGULATIONS” ON PAGE

7.



DEBIT INTERCHANGE.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ADOPTED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING THE “DURBIN AMENDMENT” PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH LIMIT THE AMOUNT THE FIRM CAN CHARGE FOR EACH DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION IT PROCESSES. IN JULY 2013, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RULED THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE EXCEEDED ITS AUTHORITY IN THE MANNER IT SET A CAP ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION INTERCHANGE FEES AND ESTABLISHED NETWORK EXCLUSIVITY PROHIBITIONS IN ITS REGULATION IMPLEMENTING THE DURBIN AMENDMENT.  THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED IN AUGUST 2013 THAT IT WAS APPEALING THE DECISION, AND ARGUMENT WAS HEARD IN JANUARY 2014. ON JANUARY 17, 2014, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT HEARD AN APPEAL BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OF THE DISTRICT COURT’S DECISION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S REGULATIONS REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE APPEAL IS DECIDED.

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

: THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATES A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SUBJECTS THEM TO HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED CAPITAL, LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT, RESOLUTION PLAN, SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS CONSIDERED A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. ON DECEMBER 20, 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN OF THE HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS.

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

: JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.  IF A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY OR ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, PURSUANT TO ITS BANK SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY, IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES.  IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANY’S DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY

3

PART I

REINVESTMENT ACT (THE “CRA”), THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS PROPOSED RULES UNDER WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL WEAKNESS, WHICH RESTRICTIONS COULD INCLUDE LIMITS ON ACQUISITIONS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE RESTRICTIONS, SEE “PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION AND EARLY REMEDIATION” ON PAGE

6.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE MORE THAN 5% OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN UNAFFILIATED BANK. PURSUANT TO THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994 (THE “RIEGLE-NEAL ACT”), THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR SUCH AN ACQUISITION WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAW OF ANY STATE, PROVIDED THAT THE ACQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANY, BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION, DOES NOT CONTROL MORE THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR MORE THAN 30% (OR SUCH GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNTS AS PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW) OF THE TOTAL DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACQUIRED BANK HAS ITS HOME OFFICE OR A BRANCH. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESTRICTS ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES IF, AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED 10% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES. FOR NON-U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANIES, LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED USING ONLY THE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF THEIR U.S. OPERATIONS. U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANIES MUST INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS HELD OVERSEAS). THIS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF ALLOWING A NON-U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANY TO GROW TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN 10% OF THE U.S. MARKET WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE CONCENTRATION LIMIT. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FIRM MUST PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY WITH OVER $10 BILLION IN ASSETS THAT IS ENGAGED IN “FINANCIAL IN NATURE” ACTIVITIES.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

: FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL BANKS. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A “RECENT EARNINGS” TEST AND AN “UNDIVIDED PROFITS” TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEAR’S NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANK’S “UNDIVIDED PROFITS.” SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGE

316

FOR THE AMOUNT OF

DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2014, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATOR’S OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION. UNDER PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DIVIDENDS ARE RESTRICTED ONCE ANY ONE OF THREE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS (TIER 1 COMMON, TIER 1 CAPITAL, OR TOTAL CAPITAL) FALLS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT (INCLUSIVE OF THE GSIB SURCHARGE) PLUS 2.5%.

MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED RULES REQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND RECEIVE A NOTICE OF NON-OBJECTION FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE TAKING CAPITAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS PAYING DIVIDENDS, IMPLEMENTING COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAMS OR REDEEMING OR REPURCHASING CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CCAR AND STRESS TESTING” ON PAGES

5–6.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

: FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO RISK-WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS. THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 4% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (“BASEL I”). IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (“BASEL II”). THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE FINALIZED FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE ACCORD (“BASEL

III”) WHICH NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES, INTRODUCED SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY COVERAGE AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AND ESTABLISHED AN INTERNATIONAL LEVERAGE RATIO.  IN JUNE 2011, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED RULES TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT BASEL I FLOOR UNDER BASEL II/BASEL III CALCULATIONS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED THE INTERIM FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING BASEL III IN THE U.S. THE INTERIM FINAL RULES NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN EXPOSURES, SET HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM FLOORS WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS AND INCLUDED A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS AND THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAVE, IN ADDITION, PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE LEVERAGE RATIOS APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM AND ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009, U.S. BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY – SUCH AS PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. TIER 1 COMMON, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USED BY BANKING REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL WITH THE CAPITAL OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION.IN JUNE 2012, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS REVISED, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013, CERTAIN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING POSITIONS AND SECURITIZATIONS (“BASEL 2.5”).

GSIBS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, ABOVE THE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY MINIMUM, IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 2.5%, DEPENDING UPON THE BANK’S SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FSB INDICATED THAT THE FIRM WOULD BE IN THE CATEGORY SUBJECT TO A 2.5% CAPITAL SURCHARGE.  FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A DISINCENTIVE FOR BANKS FACING THE HIGHEST REQUIRED LEVEL OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY TO “INCREASE MATERIALLY THEIR GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE IN THE FUTURE,” AN ADDITIONAL 1% CHARGE COULD BE APPLIED. CURRENTLY, NO GSIB IS REQUIRED TO HOLD MORE THAN THE ADDITIONAL 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON.  THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE-MAKING THAT INCORPORATES THE CONCEPT OF A CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR GSIBS.

THE BASEL III REVISIONS GOVERNING THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PROLONGED OBSERVATION AND TRANSITION PERIODS. THE PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR BANKS TO MEET THE REVISED TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENT BEGINS IN 2015, WITH IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GSIBS WILL BE PHASED-IN STARTING JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019.

THE BASEL III RULE ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO CALCULATE A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (“SLR”). THE SLR, A NON-GAAP MEASURE, IS TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER BASEL III

DIVIDED BY THE FIRM’S TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY TAKING THE FIRM’S TOTAL AVERAGE ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS, LESS AMOUNTS PERMITTED TO BE DEDUCTED FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL, AND ADDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, SUCH AS UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVES FUTURE EXPOSURE.

FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE FINAL BASEL III RULES, THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED PROPOSED RULEMAKING RELATING TO SLR THAT WOULD REQUIRE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO HAVE A MINIMUM SLR OF AT LEAST 5%. INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A MINIMUM SLR OF AT LEAST 6%. IN ADDITION, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED FURTHER REFINEMENTS TO THE COMPUTATION OF THE SLR.

IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PROPOSED TWO NEW MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK: THE “LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO” AND THE “NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO,” WHICH ARE INTENDED TO MEASURE, OVER DIFFERENT TIME SPANS, THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FIRM. THE OBSERVATION PERIODS FOR BOTH THESE STANDARDS BEGAN IN 2011, WITH IMPLEMENTATION COMMENCING IN 2015 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. ON OCTOBER 24, 2013, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS RELEASED A PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A QUANTITATIVE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT CONSISTENT WITH, BUT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN, THE BASEL III LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (“LCR”) FOR LARGE BANKS. IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR AN ACCELERATED TRANSITION PERIOD COMPARED TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL III LCR RULES. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT IT WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NEW U.S. PROPOSAL RELATED TO LCR AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROHIBITS THE USE OF EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS IN FEDERAL REGULATIONS. IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, OCC AND FDIC ISSUED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING RATINGS ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPUTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRM’S REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

161–165.

RISK REPORTING.

IN JANUARY 2013, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED NEW REGULATIONS RELATING TO RISK AGGREGATION AND REPORTING. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, THE BANK’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK MUST ENCOMPASS RISK-DATA AGGREGATION AND REPORTING, AND DATA AGGREGATION MUST BE HIGHLY AUTOMATED AND ALLOW FOR MINIMAL MANUAL INTERVENTION. THE REGULATIONS ALSO IMPOSE HIGHER STANDARDS FOR THE ACCURACY, COMPREHENSIVENESS, GRANULARITY AND TIMELY DISTRIBUTION OF DATA REPORTING, AND CALL FOR REGULAR SUPERVISORY REVIEW OF BANK RISK AGGREGATION AND REPORTING. GSIBS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE NEW STANDARDS BY JANUARY 1, 2016.

CCAR AND STRESS TESTING.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL RULES REGARDING THE SUBMISSION OF CAPITAL PLANS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE. PURSUANT TO THESE RULES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN

5

PART I

ANNUAL BASIS. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED RULES REQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS TO PERFORM AN ANNUAL STRESS TEST AND REPORT THE RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN JANUARY. THE RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL STRESS TEST WILL ALSO BE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, AND WILL BE USED AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL OR WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S CAPITAL PLAN. ON JANUARY 6, 2014, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2014 CCAR PROCESS. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FINAL RESPONSE TO ITS PLAN NO LATER THAN MARCH 14, 2014.  IN REVIEWING THE CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONSIDER BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE PLAN, THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSES UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN, AND ANY RELEVANT SUPERVISORY INFORMATION. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS TO THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST PERFORM AN ADDITIONAL STRESS TEST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THOSE RESULTS AS WELL. THE OCC ISSUED SIMILAR REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE NATIONAL BANKS WITH OVER $10 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS TO PERFORM ANNUAL STRESS TESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM SUBMITS SEPARATE STRESS TESTS TO THE OCC FOR ITS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED THAT THRESHOLD.

HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2014, THE OCC ISSUED PROPOSED RULES AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHING HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR LARGE BANKS. THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES SET FORTH STANDARDS FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BANK’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, AND MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR OVERSIGHT OF THAT FRAMEWORK BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES ARE AN EXTENSION OF THE OCC’S “HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS” FOR LARGE BANKS DEVELOPED AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THE HEIGHTENED STANDARDS ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE BANK. THE BANK MAY USE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, BUT THE FRAMEWORK MUST ENSURE THE BANK’S RISK PROFILE IS EASILY DISTINGUISHED AND SEPARATE FROM PARENT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. UNDER THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES, THE BOARD IS REQUIRED TO HAVE TWO MEMBERS WHO ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE BANK AND PARENT COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK MEETS THE STANDARDS IN THE OCC’S GUIDELINES, PROVIDING ACTIVE OVERSIGHT AND CREDIBLE CHALLENGE TO MANAGEMENT’S RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS, AND ENSURING THAT THE PARENT COMPANY DECISIONS DO NOT JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE BANK.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION AND EARLY REMEDIATION

: THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE “PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION” WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. WHILE THESE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE

APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST THE PARENT BANK HOLDING COMPANY, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF ANY BANK SUBSIDIARY. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN FOR ITS UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY.

IN ADDITION, IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED PROPOSED RULES WHICH PROVIDE FOR EARLY REMEDIATION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL WEAKNESS. THESE PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS COULD INCLUDE LIMITS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, ACQUISITIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE

: THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN DEPOSITS, WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FDIC. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR INSURED DEPOSITS HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR TO $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR. IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED STRESS ON THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND CAUSED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE THE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY. AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE IN FEBRUARY 2011 THAT CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT BASE FROM INSURED DEPOSITS TO AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS LESS AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY, AND CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT RATE CALCULATION. THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 1, 2011, AND RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THE FIRM’S BANK SUBSIDIARIES PAY ANNUALLY TO THE FDIC.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF THE FIRM OR ITS INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES

: UPON THE INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER UNDER THE FDIA. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHERE A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., IS IN DEFAULT OR DANGER OF DEFAULT, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED RECEIVER IN ORDER TO CONDUCT AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION. IN BOTH CASES, THE FDIC HAS BROAD POWERS TO TRANSFER ANY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE INSTITUTION’S CREDITORS.

DEPOSITOR PREFERENCE.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES. AS A RESULT, SUCH PERSONS COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.  THE U.K. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (THE “PRA”) HAS ISSUED A PROPOSAL THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EITHER OBTAIN EQUAL TREATMENT FOR U.K. DEPOSITORS OR “SUBSIDIARIZE” IN THE U.K. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE, WHICH CLARIFIES THAT FOREIGN DEPOSITS ARE

6

CONSIDERED DEPOSITS UNDER THE FDIA ONLY IF THEY ARE ALSO PAYABLE IN THE UNITED STATES.

CROSS-GUARANTEE.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING “IN DEFAULT” OR “IN DANGER OF DEFAULT” (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “CROSS-GUARANTEE” LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT

: THE BANK SECRECY ACT (“BSA”) REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM. THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE DILIGENCE/KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH BSA REQUIREMENTS.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE

: THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACTS AS AN “UMBRELLA REGULATOR” AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE REGULATED BY THE OCC. SEE “OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION” ON PAGES

7–8

FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRM’S SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT.

HOLDING COMPANY AS SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES

: JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS REQUIRED TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

: THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LIMITS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGE

316

. EFFECTIVE IN 2012, THE DODD-FRANK ACT EXTENDED SUCH RESTRICTIONS TO DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT’S VOLCKER RULE IMPOSES SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND HEDGE FUNDS OR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS FOR WHICH THE BANKING ENTITY SERVES AS THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, INVESTMENT ADVISOR OR SPONSOR.

CFPB AND OTHER CONSUMER REGULATIONS

: THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AND CARD ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATION AND COLLECTION PRACTICES.

THE CFPB ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 10, 2014, AND WHICH WILL PROHIBIT MORTGAGE SERVICERS FROM BEGINNING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL A MORTGAGE LOAN IS 120 DAYS DELINQUENT. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE BORROWER MAY APPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION OR OTHER OPTION AND THE SERVICER CANNOT BEGIN FORECLOSURE UNTIL THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. THE CFPB ISSUED ANOTHER FINAL REGULATION WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 10, 2014, IMPOSING AN “ABILITY TO REPAY” REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. A CREDITOR (OR ITS ASSIGNEE) WILL BE LIABLE TO THE BORROWER FOR DAMAGES IF THE CREDITOR FAILS TO MAKE A “GOOD FAITH AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION OF A BORROWER’S REASONABLE ABILITY TO REPAY AS OF CONSUMMATION.” BORROWERS CAN SUE THE CREDITOR OR ASSIGNEE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS AFTER CLOSING, AND CAN RAISE AN ABILITY TO REPAY CLAIM AGAINST THE SERVICER AS A SET OFF AT ANY POINT DURING THE LOAN’S LIFE IF IN FORECLOSURE. A “QUALIFIED MORTGAGE” AS DEFINED IN THE REGULATION IS GENERALLY PROTECTED FROM SUCH SUITS.

ON APRIL 22, 2013, THE OCC ISSUED GUIDANCE REGARDING THE OBLIGATION OF SERVICERS TO TRACK LOANS SCHEDULED FOR FORECLOSURE SALE WITHIN 60 DAYS AND TO CONFIRM CERTAIN INFORMATION PRIOR TO PROCEEDING WITH THE SCHEDULED SALE. THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO EFFECT COMPLIANCE WITH THIS GUIDANCE.

ON MARCH 21, 2013, THE CFPB ISSUED A BULLETIN REGARDING “INDIRECT AUTO LENDING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT,” IN WHICH IT DECLARED THAT A PURCHASER OF AUTOMOBILE LOANS (“INDIRECT LENDER”) FROM AUTOMOBILE DEALERS MAY BE LIABLE FOR EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT VIOLATIONS BASED ON DEALER SPECIFIC AND PORTFOLIO WIDE DISPARITIES, ON A PROHIBITED BASIS, THAT RESULT FROM ALLOWING DEALERS TO MARK UP THE INTEREST RATE OFFERED TO CONSUMERS BY INDIRECT LENDERS AND ALLOWING THE DEALERS A SHARE OF THE INCREASED REVENUE. THE BULLETIN IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT DEALER EDUCATION AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS ON THESE INDIRECT LENDERS IF THEY CONTINUE ALLOWING DISCRETIONARY DEALER MARK-UPS. ALTERNATIVELY, THE BULLETIN INDICATES THAT A FLAT FEE ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.  THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED A DEALER EDUCATION AND MONITORING PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE BULLETIN.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

: THE FIRM’S BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED “FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS” UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT). JPMORGAN CHASE’S NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO

7

PART I

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANK’S BUSINESS AND CONDITION, STRESS TESTS OF BANKS AND IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, AMONG OTHER POWERS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMILAR SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED BY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC, WHICH IS REGULATED BY THE PRA (A SUBSIDIARY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRUDENTIAL REGULATION OF BANKS AND OTHER SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (WHICH REGULATES PRUDENTIAL MATTERS FOR OTHER FIRMS AND CONDUCT MATTERS FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS). JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC. THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND ARE REGISTERED ACCORDINGLY.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TWO SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE EITHER REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS OR EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRM’S U.S. ENERGY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY.

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CFTC AND SEC ARE THE REGULATORS OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES.  JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC AND J.P. MORGAN VENTURES ENERGY CORPORATION HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS SWAP DEALERS. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC MAY ALSO NEED TO REGISTER WITH THE SEC AS SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS.

THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRM’S POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE

AFFILIATES AND OTHERS, AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO “OPT OUT” OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NON-AFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES.

THE EU  HAS CREATED A EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD WHICH MONITORS FINANCIAL STABILITY, TOGETHER WITH A FRAMEWORK OF EUROPEAN SUPERVISORY AGENCIES WHICH OVERSEES THE REGULATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP OF TWENTY FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS (“G-20”) FORMED THE FSB. AT BOTH G-20 AND EU LEVELS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION TO ADDRESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THE INITIATIVES ADOPTED INCLUDE INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRADING INSTRUMENTS OR EXPOSURES AND COMPENSATION LIMITS ON CERTAIN EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES.

IN THE EU, THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX PROGRAM OF PROPOSED REGULATORY ENHANCEMENT WHICH REFLECTS, IN PART, THE EU’S COMMITMENTS TO POLICIES OF THE G-20 TOGETHER WITH OTHER PLANS SPECIFIC TO THE EU. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES EMIR, WHICH WILL REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES AND WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN BY 2015; AND MIFID II, WHICH GIVES EFFECT TO THE G-20 COMMITMENT TO ON-VENUE TRADING OF DERIVATIVES AND ALSO INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR PRE- AND POST-TRADE TRANSPARENCY AND A SIGNIFICANT RECONFIGURATION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION OF EXECUTION VENUES.

THE EU IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONSIDERING OR EXECUTING UPON SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO LAWS COVERING: DEPOSITARY ACTIVITIES; CREDIT RATING ACTIVITIES; RESOLUTION OF BANKS, INVESTMENT FIRMS AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES; ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING CONTROLS; DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN FINANCIAL FIRMS, TOGETHER WITH IMPLEMENTATION IN THE EU OF THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS.

FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF THE REPORT OF THE HIGH LEVEL EXPERT GROUP ON REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF THE EU BANKING SECTOR (THE “LIIKANEN GROUP”), THE EU HAS PROPOSED LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR A PROPRIETARY TRADING BAN AND MANDATORY SEPARATION OF OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES WITHIN CERTAIN BANKS, WHILE VARIOUS EU MEMBER STATES HAVE SEPARATELY ENACTED SIMILAR MEASURES. IN THE U.K., THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING (THE “VICKERS COMMISSION”) PROPOSED CERTAIN PROVISIONS, WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN ENACTED BY PARLIAMENT AND UPON WHICH DETAILED IMPLEMENTING REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPECTED DURING 2014, THAT MANDATE THE SEPARATION (OR “RING-FENCING”) OF DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES FROM SECURITIES TRADING AND OTHER ANALOGOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN BANKS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. THE LEGISLATION INCLUDES THE SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION ON BANKING STANDARDS (THE “TYRIE COMMISSION”) THAT SUCH RING-FENCES SHOULD BE “ELECTRIFIED” BY THE IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY FORCED SEPARATION ON BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF THE SAFEGUARDS. PARALLEL BUT DISTINCT PROVISIONS

8

HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY THE FRENCH AND GERMAN GOVERNMENTS, AND OTHERS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. FURTHER, THE EU IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A “BANKING UNION” INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK, COMPRISING CENTRAL SUPERVISION OF SYSTEMIC INSTITUTIONS BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, AND A SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM FOR RESOLVING FAILING BANKS ALONGSIDE THE RECENTLY-AGREED BANK RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION DIRECTIVE. THESE MEASURES MAY SEPARATELY OR TAKEN TOGETHER HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FIRM'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS ITS PERMITTED ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT IN THE EU.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH THE MATERIAL RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

REGULATORY RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AND CAN RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF THE FIRM’S EXISTING BUSINESSES AND LIMIT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR CAN MAKE ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS.

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT AND COMPREHENSIVE NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED IN RECENT YEARS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY, MOST NOTABLY THE DODD-FRANK ACT IN THE UNITED STATES. CERTAIN KEY REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE VOLCKER RULE AND THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS HAVE NOW BEEN ADOPTED, AND THE FIRM CONTINUES TO

MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE AND CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO

COMPLY WITH THESE AND OTHER NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, U.S. AND OTHER REGULATORS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, PROPOSE AND ADOPT RULES AND PROPOSE NEW REGULATORY INITIATIVES, SO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ALL OF THE NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS THAT SIMILAR REGULATORY INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND REGIONS IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE DOES BUSINESS. NON-U.S. REGULATIONS AND

INITIATIVES MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR MAY CONFLICT WITH CURRENT OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH COULD CREATE INCREASED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE FIRM AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS, OPERATIONS OR PROFITABILITY.

THESE RECENT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE FIRM, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM OR OTHERWISE REDUCE THE FIRM’S PROFITABILITY, LIMIT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO DISPOSE OF OR CURTAIL CERTAIN BUSINESSES, AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

EXPANDED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES WILL INCREASE THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS AND MAY REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF THOSE BUSINESSES.

IN RECENT YEARS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS AND SETTLEMENTS WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO IN APRIL 2011 RELATING TO THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES; THE FEBRUARY 2012 GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES; THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO IN JANUARY 2013 RELATING TO THE FIRM’S BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND TO CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS TRADING ACTIVITIES; THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO SEPTEMBER 2013 CONCERNING OVERSIGHT OF THIRD PARTIES, OPERATIONAL PROCESSES AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CREDIT CARD COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PRACTICES AND TO BILLING PRACTICES FOR CREDIT MONITORING PRODUCTS FORMERLY OFFERED BY THE FIRM; THE SETTLEMENTS IN NOVEMBER 2013 OF CERTAIN REPURCHASE REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS BY A GROUP OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL RELATING TO CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM, BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL; THE DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN JANUARY 2014 WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH THE OCC AND THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK ("FINCEN") RELATING TO BERNARD L. MADOFF INVESTMENT SECURITIES LLC AND THE FIRM'S AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM; AND THE FEBRUARY

2014 SETTLEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH SEVERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE FIRM’S PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN FEDERAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS REQUIRE THE FIRM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN CERTAIN CONTROLS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES; IN SOME CASES, TO ENGAGE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL PERSONNEL TO REVIEW PAST TRANSACTIONS OR TO MONITOR THE EXTENT TO WHICH CITED LAPSES

9

PART I

HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED; AND TO FURNISH ITS REGULATORS WITH PERIODIC REPORTS CONCERNING THE FIRM’S PROGRESS IN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS. THE FIRM HAS ALSO PAID SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES OR PROVIDED MONETARY AND OTHER RELIEF IN CONNECTION WITH MANY OF THESE ACTIONS AND SETTLEMENTS.

THE FIRM IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS, THE EXPANSION OF RISK AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE HIRING OF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ADDITIONAL RISK, CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL, ALL OF WHICH HAS INCREASED THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE FIRM IS EXPERIENCING HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT SUCH REGULATORY SCRUTINY WILL CONTINUE, AND THAT REGULATORS WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION, RATHER THAN TAKING INFORMAL SUPERVISORY ACTIONS, MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THEY HAVE DONE HISTORICALLY.

IF THE FIRM FAILS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSENT ORDERS, THE DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, OR MORE GENERALLY, TO EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE ITS RISK AND CONTROL PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MEET HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS BY ITS REGULATORS, IT MAY CONTINUE TO FACE A GREATER NUMBER OR WIDER SCOPE OF INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND LITIGATION, THEREBY INCREASING ITS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO OR DEFENDING SUCH ACTIONS, AND IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO FURTHER ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, PAY ADDITIONAL FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, OR ACCEPT MATERIAL REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, FURTHER REGULATORY INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS AND ACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, AND ANY REQUIRED CHANGES TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE, LIMIT THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THE FIRM OFFERS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON THE FIRM, CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

UNDER THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, HOLDERS OF THE FIRM’S DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT CLEAR RISK OF LOSS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, JPMORGAN CHASE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS ANNUAL UPDATE TO ITS PLAN FOR RESOLUTION OF THE FIRM. THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN INCLUDES STRATEGIES TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, AND ALSO RECOMMENDS TO THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE

THE FIRM’S PROPOSED OPTIMAL STRATEGY TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE SPECIAL RESOLUTION PROCEDURE PROVIDED IN TITLE II OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT (“TITLE II”).

THE FIRM’S RECOMMENDATION FOR ITS OPTIMAL TITLE II STRATEGY WOULD INVOLVE A “SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY” RECAPITALIZATION MODEL IN WHICH THE FDIC WOULD USE ITS POWER TO CREATE A “BRIDGE ENTITY” FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, TRANSFER THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND VIABLE PARTS OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY THE STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S MAIN OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE BRIDGE ENTITY, RECAPITALIZE THOSE BUSINESSES BY CONTRIBUTING SOME OR ALL OF SUCH INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS TO THE CAPITAL OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, AND BY EXCHANGING DEBT CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FOR EQUITY IN THE BRIDGE ENTITY. IF THE FIRM WERE TO BE RESOLVED UNDER THIS STRATEGY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE BRIDGE ENTITY DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOLDERS OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY OR SATISFY ALL OR PART OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF, AND INTEREST ON, THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH SUCH STOCK WAS EXCHANGED.

MARKET RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERAL WEATHER CONDITIONS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; MONETARY POLICIES AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AND THE HEALTH OF U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES.

IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS CAN AFFECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRM’S UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES; THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS; THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS EXTENSIVE MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITIES AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS. THE FIRM MAY HAVE MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS, CREDIT SPREADS, AND

10

AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUE RELATING TO ITS MARKET-MAKING AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL AFFECT PRICING OR THE ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES, AND THAT THIS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS.

THE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN SECURITIES MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S REVENUE. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRM’S FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS.

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET AND THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM EARNS FROM NET INTEREST INCOME. A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT OR A FLAT OR INVERTED YIELD CURVE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES BY COMPRESSING NET INTEREST MARGINS, REDUCING THE AMOUNTS THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR REDUCING THE VALUE OF ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”) ASSET, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER REVENUES.

THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. IF THE CURRENT POSITIVE TRENDS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY ARE NOT SUSTAINED, THIS COULD DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES OR PERSISTENT HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE FIRM’S EARNINGS.

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE FIRM TO BORROW ON BOTH A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS. CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN OR NARROW NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO FIRM-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS AND CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS WILL IMPACT, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FIRM’S EARNINGS ON LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FINALLY, ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE RECENT EUROZONE DEBT CRISIS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OR MORE SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULTS, SIGNIFICANT BANK FAILURES OR DEFAULTS AND/OR THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DECLINES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY, A CONTRACTION OF

AVAILABLE CREDIT, AND DIMINISHED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IN THE EUROZONE. THERE ARE CONTINUING CONCERNS AS TO THE ULTIMATE FINANCIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ASSISTANCE MEASURES TAKEN TO DATE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUSTERITY MEASURES MAY EXACERBATE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND TEST THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STABILITY OF WEAKER ECONOMIES IN THE EUROZONE. THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BOTH BY LOCALIZED ECONOMIC CRISES IN PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS OR WHEN REGIONAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL CAUSES DETERIORATION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CREDIT RISK

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF MARKET-MAKING, TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUNDS, INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK AND, IN SOME CASES, DISPUTES AND LITIGATION IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT.

THE FIRM IS A MARKET LEADER IN PROVIDING CLEARING AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES, AND ALSO ACTS AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE SECURITIES AND REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET, INCLUDING THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. MANY OF THESE SERVICES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, A CENTRAL COUNTERPARTY (“CCP”) OR ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT.

AS PART OF PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF A NUMBER OF CCPS, AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF OTHER MEMBERS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER, THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS, WHICH IT SEEKS TO MITIGATE THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE COLLATERAL. IN ITS ROLE AS CUSTODIAN BANK IN THE SECURITIES AND REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET, THE FIRM CAN BE EXPOSED TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF ITS CLIENTS. IF A CLIENT TO WHOM THE FIRM PROVIDES SUCH SERVICES BECOMES BANKRUPT OR INSOLVENT, THE FIRM MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN DISPUTES AND LITIGATION WITH VARIOUS PARTIES, INCLUDING ONE OR MORE CCP’S, THE CLIENT’S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE AND OTHER CREDITORS, OR INVOLVED IN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS. ALL OF SUCH EVENTS CAN INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND LITIGATION COSTS AND MAY RESULT IN LOSSES IF ANY COLLATERAL RECEIVED BY THE FIRM DECLINES IN VALUE.

DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS OR ILLIQUIDITY, THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE FIRM CANNOT REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT OR WHEN COLLATERAL IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO THE FIRM. FURTHER, DISPUTES WITH OBLIGORS AS

11

PART I

TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY COULD PRODUCE LOSSES IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRM’S INABILITY TO SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE THE VALUE OF ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRM’S POSITIONS MAY NOT ONLY INCREASE THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE OTHERWISE EXPERIENCING DISRUPTION, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (“SPES”) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN SELLING OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS) DURING THAT TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IF THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO STABLE AND LOW COST SOURCES OF FUNDING, SUCH AS BANK DEPOSITS, ARE REDUCED, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO RAISE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING WHICH MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE OR OF LIMITED AVAILABILITY.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH FLOW AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION OR CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD REDUCE ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

SOME REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING LARGE BANKS TO INCORPORATE A SEPARATE SUBSIDIARY IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY FOR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. IF ADOPTED, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD HINDER THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE ITS FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER.

REDUCTIONS IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY AND COST OF FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ARE CURRENTLY RATED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. IN 2013, MOODY’S DOWNGRADED ITS RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND SEVERAL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BASED ON MOODY’S REASSESSMENT OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO IMPLICIT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SUCH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, AS OF YEAR-END 2013, S&P HAD JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. ON “NEGATIVE” OUTLOOK, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A DOWNGRADE IN RATINGS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, THE RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, RATING UPLIFT ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, FUTURE PROFITABILITY, RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LEGAL EXPENSES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE RATINGS ACTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DOWNGRADES FROM RATING AGENCIES, IF THEY AFFECTED THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS, WOULD NOT OCCUR AT TIMES OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY WHEN THE FIRM’S OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS MAY BE MORE LIMITED AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

FURTHER, A REDUCTION IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS, MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING DEBT, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY CURTAILING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCH REDUCTION IN CREDIT RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT SPREADS CHARGED BY THE MARKET FOR TAKING CREDIT RISK ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE ISSUED OR MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE.

12

LEGAL RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES. ACTIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, AND AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS THE REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM AND ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL CONSENT ORDERS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ISSUED BY THEM IN THE FUTURE. THESE AND OTHER INITIATIVES FROM FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FURTHER JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES, OR CAUSE THE FIRM TO BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL ISSUES, OR HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S REVENUE.

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES) ARE BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES ON THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND MARKET-MAKING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH SUCH COMPANIES OPERATE, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS AND CONSIDERATIONS AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS OR MAY CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THOSE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS. IN SOME CASES, CONCERNS REGARDING THE FISCAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES CAN LEAD TO “MARKET CONTAGION” TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE SAME REGION OR BEYOND THE REGION. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY MAY BE HINDERED BY LOCAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPANDED AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GROW ITS INTERNATIONAL WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IN EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA (“EMEA”), ASIA/PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA/CARIBBEAN OVER TIME.  AS PART OF ITS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY, THE FIRM SEEKS TO PROVIDE A WIDER RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO ITS CLIENTS THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THOSE REGIONS.

SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE CONDUCTS ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES HAVE ECONOMIES OR MARKETS THAT ARE LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE VOLATILE, AND MAY HAVE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE LESS ESTABLISHED OR PREDICTABLE, THAN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS IN WHICH THE FIRM CURRENTLY OPERATES. SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS, OR HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICIES SUCH AS CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THESE COUNTRIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO, SOCIAL UNREST, GENERAL STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES, OVERTHROW OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER FORMS OF INTERNAL DISCORD, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRIES. POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OR DISLOCATION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM CONDUCTS ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES CAN HINDER THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THOSE OPERATIONS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ITS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY.

13

PART I

LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES CAN ALSO HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY BASIS OR GUIDANCE FOR ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS OR TRANSACTIONS, OR THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OR INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; DIFFICULTY IN COMPETING IN ECONOMIES IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS OR PROTECTS ALL OR A PORTION OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY OR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES, OR WHERE GRAFT OR CORRUPTION MAY BE PERVASIVE; AND THE THREAT OF ARBITRARY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, CIVIL LITIGATIONS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS INCLUDING EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES OFTEN REQUIRES THE FIRM TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UNDERSTANDING, AND MONITORING CHANGES IN, LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING RELATED INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL ALWAYS BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS PREDICTABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM CAN ALSO INCUR HIGHER COSTS, AND FACE GREATER COMPLIANCE RISKS, IN STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO COMPLY WITH U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION AND HAS INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE

ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY, AND TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES FROM THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. FURTHERMORE, LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS.

THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE FIRM’S CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE FIRM’S ACTIONS TO MITIGATE ITS RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND EMPLOYEES, AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES OF SUCH SYSTEMS OR MISCONDUCT BY SUCH EMPLOYEES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OR MORE OF ITS EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM CHANGES PROCESSES OR INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO

14

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AS WELL AS RETAILERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS DO BUSINESS, CAN ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO SECURITY BREACHES AFFECTING SUCH PARTIES AND BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF THE SYSTEMS OR MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PARTIES. INCIDENTS OF THESE TYPES MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OWN OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR TO SAFEGUARD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR ITS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY INCREASING THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DIMINISH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE FIRM’S POSSESSION WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER THROUGH THE FAULT OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY BREACHES (AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW); ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES; FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS, INCLUDING STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESILIENCY PLANS ARE BOTH SUFFICIENT AND ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PLANS WILL FULLY MITIGATE ALL POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS TO THE FIRM. ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SUBJECTING THE FIRM TO LOSSES OR LIABILITY, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE FAILURE OR DISRUPTION, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

A BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SYSTEMS COULD DISRUPT ITS BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE ITS REPUTATION AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND LEGAL EXPOSURE FOR THE FIRM.

ALTHOUGH JPMORGAN CHASE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPGRADE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION BELONGING TO THE FIRM AND ITS CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES WILL PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS AND COMPANIES ENGAGED IN DATA PROCESSING HAVE REPORTED BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF THEIR WEBSITES OR OTHER SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE INVOLVED SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED ATTACKS INTENDED TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE, OFTEN THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALWARE, CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER MEANS. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH WERE INTENDED TO DISRUPT ONLINE BANKING SERVICES, AS WELL AS DATA BREACHES DUE TO CYBERATTACKS WHICH, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, HAVE RESULTED IN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CUSTOMER DATA.

DESPITE THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ITS SYSTEMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES OF THESE TYPES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE CYBERATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE THE FIRM SUCH AS PERSONS WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR WHO MAY BE LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THOSE PARTIES MAY ALSO ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR OTHER USERS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE FIRM’S DATA OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS MOBILE-PAYMENT AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANDS ITS INTERNAL USAGE OF WEB-BASED PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS.

A SUCCESSFUL PENETRATION OR CIRCUMVENTION OF THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRM, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS, OR DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS OR SYSTEMS OF THE FIRM AND THOSE OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE FIRM OR TO ITS CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, SIGNIFICANT

15

PART I

LITIGATION EXPOSURE, AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS AND ITS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING EVERY RISK TO THE FIRM, THEREBY RESULTING IN LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT.  HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. ANY LAPSE IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR OTHER INADEQUACIES IN THE DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE, PROCEDURES OR PRACTICES COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE FIRM, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE ANY RISK MANAGEMENT DEFICIENCY, ATTRACT HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES, LENDING COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE, AS WELL AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK. AS ONE OF THE NATION’S LARGEST LENDERS, THE FIRM HAS EXPOSURES ARISING FROM ITS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS EARNINGS. THE FIRM ESTABLISHES ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE, INCLUDING UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA)

MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT SUCH AS A DERIVATIVE. CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES. IN PARTICULAR, DISPUTES REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, AND IMPAIR THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

MANY OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OR TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT’S SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED AND COULD AGAIN LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES.

MANY OF THE MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW NOT ONLY BY THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK FUNCTION BUT ALSO BY THE FIRM’S REGULATORS IN ORDER THAT THE FIRM MAY UTILIZE SUCH MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S CALCULATIONS OF MARKET RISK RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (“RWA”) AND CREDIT RISK RWA UNDER THE ADVANCED APPROACH OF BASEL III. THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER CAPITAL CHARGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS OR LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESSES, IF SUCH MODELS DO NOT RECEIVE APPROVAL BY ITS REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT THE FIRM HOLDS WITH RESPECT TO OPERATIONAL RISK, AS DERIVED FROM ITS OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS, WILL

16

NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE FIRM’S PROFITABILITY.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MUST COMPLY WITH ENHANCED STANDARDS FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE FIRM. THESE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THE FIRM BOTH UNDER GENERAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE CONSENT ORDER ENTERED INTO BY THE FIRM RELATING TO COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PRACTICES. THE FIRM HAS INCURRED AND EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSIGHT OF ITS THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. FAILURE BY THE FIRM TO APPROPRIATELY ASSESS AND MANAGE THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT BANKING FUNCTIONS, SHARED SERVICES OR OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES, COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS IMPOSED BY THE FIRM’S REGULATORS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

LAPSES IN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, PROFITABILITY OR REPUTATION.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OR THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN. ANY SUCH LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT IT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

OTHER RISKS

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, INVESTMENT MANAGERS, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING

COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPETITORS OF THE FIRM’S NON-U.S. WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REGULATORY OBJECTIVES UNDERLYING SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE AND THE DERIVATIVES “PUSH-OUT” RULES, HAVE NOT BEEN EMBRACED BY GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED INTO LAW IN MOST COUNTRIES. THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, CAN PUT THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO ITS NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING THE FIRM FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE FIRM’S PRICING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE FIRM’S COST STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE THE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS, AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRM’S MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON THE FIRM OR ITS EMPLOYEES OF RESTRICTIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

17

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. THE FIRM’S REPUTATION COULD ALSO BE HARMED BY THE FAILURE OF AN AFFILIATE, JOINT-VENTURER OR MERCHANT BANKING PORTFOLIO COMPANY, OR A VENDOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, OR A FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS FAIRLY, CAN RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST REVENUE, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. ADVERSE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRM’S PROSPECTS. ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OCCUR, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING

RISE TO THE REPUTATIONAL HARM COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRM’S CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH THE FIRM, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

PART II

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE. SEE EXHIBITS 31.1 AND 31.2 FOR THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS

JPMORGAN CHASE

, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING” ON PAGE

182

. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE

THREE MONTHS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

ITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION

PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012, WHICH ADDED SECTION 13(R) TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), AN ISSUER IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN ITS ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY REPORTS, AS APPLICABLE, WHETHER IT OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES KNOWINGLY ENGAGED IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS RELATING TO IRAN OR WITH INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVE ORDERS. DISCLOSURE IS GENERALLY REQUIRED EVEN WHERE THE ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS WERE CONDUCTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER ACTIVITY, TRANSACTION OR DEALING BY ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 THAT REQUIRES DISCLOSURE UNDER SECTION 219.

CARLSON WAGONLIT TRAVEL (“CWT”), A BUSINESS TRAVEL MANAGEMENT FIRM IN WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS INVESTED THROUGH ITS MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, MAY BE DEEMED TO BE AN AFFILIATE OF THE FIRM, AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 12B-2. CWT HAS INFORMED THE FIRM THAT, DURING THE

YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, IT BOOKED APPROXIMATELY 15 FLIGHTS (OF THE APPROXIMATELY 60 MILLION TRANSACTIONS IT BOOKED IN 2013) TO IRAN ON IRAN AIR FOR PASSENGERS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. ALL OF SUCH FLIGHTS ORIGINATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES FROM COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT TRAVEL TO IRAN, AND NONE OF SUCH PASSENGERS WERE PERSONS DESIGNATED UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDERS 13224 OR 13382 OR WERE EMPLOYEES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE TARGETS OF U.S. SANCTIONS. CWT AND THE FIRM BELIEVE THAT THIS ACTIVITY IS PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM U.S. SANCTIONS FOR TRAVEL-RELATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT, AS AMENDED. CWT HAD APPROXIMATELY $10,000 IN GROSS REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE TRANSACTIONS. CWT HAS INFORMED THE FIRM THAT IT INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY SO LONG AS SUCH ACTIVITY IS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. LAW.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

THIS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF THE MD&A HIGHLIGHTS SELECTED INFORMATION AND MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO READERS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS WELL AS THE ENTERPRISE RISKS AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AFFECTING THE FIRM AND ITS VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS, THIS ANNUAL REPORT SHOULD BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY REGAINED MOMENTUM IN 2013, LED BY FASTER GROWTH IN THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES, HELPED BY DECISIVE POLICY ACTIONS IN THE U.S., EUROPEAN UNION, U.K., AND JAPAN. UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT U.S. FISCAL POLICY WERE REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY BY YEAR-END, AS WERE EXTREME DOWNSIDE RISKS TO PERFORMANCE IN THE EUROZONE AND CHINA THAT HAD BEEN CONCERNS EARLIER IN THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, REAL CONSUMER SPENDING IN THE U.S. WAS SUPPORTED LATE IN THE YEAR BY SOLID JOB GROWTH, FALLING GASOLINE PRICES, AND RISING EQUITY AND HOUSE PRICES.

THE U.S. ECONOMIC FORECAST FOR 2014 LOOKS FOR A GRADUAL ACCELERATION IN REAL SALES GROWTH AND FOR INFLATION TO REMAIN WELL BELOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE’S LONG-RUN TARGET OF 2%. IF THE ECONOMIC FORECAST FOR 2014 IS REALIZED, THE TAPERING OF ASSET PURCHASES BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE WILL PROCEED AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE END OF 2014. HOWEVER, THE FORECAST DOES NOT LOOK FOR A FIRST RATE HIKE BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE UNTIL SOMETIME IN 2015.

THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK’S (“ECB”) SUPPORT IN STABILIZING EUROPEAN FINANCIAL MARKETS, ALONG WITH THE CONSTRUCTIVE STEPS TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A MORE COHERENT BANKING UNION, HELPED THE REGION TO RETURN TO GROWTH DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013. HOWEVER, LATER IN THE YEAR, THE PACE OF THE EUROZONE’S RECOVERY REMAINED SLOW, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT TESTED THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STABILITY OF SEVERAL OF EUROPE’S WEAKER ECONOMIES, AND CYPRUS BECAME THE FOURTH COUNTRY IN THE EUROZONE TO RECEIVE A FULL BAIL-OUT. WHILE GERMANY AND THE NORTHERN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES CONTINUED TO DRIVE GROWTH, ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE GROWTH WAS MORE SUBDUED. MORE ENCOURAGING WERE SIGNS THAT THE PERIPHERAL ECONOMIES IN THE REGION ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF HEALING.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN ASIA WAS MIXED IN 2013. JAPAN BOOMED; IN CONTRAST, ACTIVITY DECELERATED ACROSS MUCH OF THE REST OF THE REGION. GROWTH OUTCOMES WERE ALSO MIXED ACROSS LATIN AMERICA. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DECELERATED IN MEXICO. BRAZIL BEGAN 2013 WITH POSITIVE MOMENTUM BUT THEN LOST SIGNIFICANT STEAM, WITH A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN PROJECTED GROWTH OUTCOMES AND INFLATION INDICATORS. POLICY UNCERTAINTIES, SLOWING CHINA DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES, CREDIT OVERHANGS, AND ELEVATED INFLATION ALL WEIGHED ON INVESTMENT IN MANY EMERGING COUNTRIES.

IN SUMMARY, THERE IS REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN 2014. THE ECONOMY FINALLY APPEARS TO HAVE BROKEN OUT OF THE 2% RANGE OF GROWTH EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OF RECOVERY, AND THE EXTENT OF BOTH FISCAL POLICY RESTRAINT AND FISCAL POLICY UNCERTAINTY SHOULD BE SHARPLY REDUCED. WHILE GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN SUBDUED, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACCELERATING IN EUROPE.

SUMMARY OF 2013 RESULTS

JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTED FULL-YEAR 2013 NET INCOME OF $17.9 BILLION, OR $4.35 PER SHARE, ON NET REVENUE OF $96.6 BILLION. NET INCOME DECREASED BY $3.3 BILLION, OR 16%, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $21.3 BILLION, OR $5.20 PER SHARE, IN 2012. ROE FOR THE YEAR WAS 9%, COMPARED WITH 11% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME IN 2013 WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSE. THE REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED CONTINUED FAVORABLE CREDIT TRENDS ACROSS THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS.

THE DECLINE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED LOWER CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS AS NET CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS REDUCED BY $5.6 BILLION IN 2013. THE DECLINE IN THE ALLOWANCE REFLECTED IMPROVED HOME PRICES IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD LOAN AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FIRMWIDE, NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $5.8 BILLION FOR THE YEAR, DOWN $3.3 BILLION, OR 36%, FROM 2012, WHICH INCLUDED $800 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO REGULATORY GUIDANCE. NONPERFORMING ASSETS AT YEAR-END WERE $9.7 BILLION, DOWN $2.2 BILLION, OR 18%. TOTAL FIRMWIDE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $17.0 BILLION, RESULTING IN A LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.80%, EXCLUDING THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO, COMPARED WITH 2.43% IN 2012.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM’S RESULTS REFLECTED STRONG UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE ACROSS ITS FOUR MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, WITH STRONG LENDING AND DEPOSIT GROWTH.

THE FIRM ESTIMATED THAT ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS, BASED ON THE INTERIM FINAL RULE ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2013, WAS 9.5% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. TOTAL DEPOSITS INCREASED TO $1.3 TRILLION, UP 8% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WAS $211.2 BILLION. (THE BASEL I AND III TIER 1 COMMON RATIOS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH THE FIRM USES ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES, TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL RATIOS, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

161–165

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.)

DURING 2013, THE FIRM WORKED TO HELP ITS CUSTOMERS, CORPORATE CLIENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS. THE FIRM PROVIDED CREDIT TO AND RAISED CAPITAL OF MORE THAN $2.1 TRILLION FOR ITS CLIENTS DURING 2013; THIS INCLUDED $19 BILLION LENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND $79 BILLION TO NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, INCLUDING STATES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES. THE FIRM ALSO ORIGINATED MORE THAN 800,000 MORTGAGES.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AND PRESENTS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS. MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED RESULTS UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“U.S. GAAP”) AND, FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND THE FIRM AS A WHOLE, INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, AS WELL AS OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, SEE PAGES

82–83

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING

NET INCOME INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEPOSIT MARGINS, LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO NET PORTFOLIO RUNOFF AND SPREAD COMPRESSION IN CREDIT CARD, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE DECREASED, DRIVEN BY LOWER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CARD INCOME. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $335 MILLION COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $5.5 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND TOTAL NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $5.8 BILLION. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $5.5 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND TOTAL NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $9.3 BILLION, INCLUDING $800 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO REGULATORY GUIDANCE. NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENTS IN CHASE PRIVATE CLIENT EXPANSION, HIGHER NON-MBS RELATED LEGAL EXPENSE IN MORTGAGE PRODUCTION, HIGHER AUTO LEASE DEPRECIATION AND COSTS RELATED TO THE CONTROL AGENDA.

CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK

NET INCOME INCREASED BY 2%  COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET REVENUE INCLUDED A $1.5 BILLION LOSS FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (“FVA”) FRAMEWORK FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND A $452 MILLION LOSS FROM DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES. THE PRIOR YEAR NET REVENUE INCLUDED A $930 MILLION LOSS FROM DVA. BANKING REVENUE INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER LENDING AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE WHICH WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. LENDING REVENUE INCREASED DRIVEN BY GAINS ON SECURITIES RECEIVED FROM RESTRUCTURED LOANS. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES REVENUE INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY HIGHER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVISORY FEES. EXCLUDING FVA (EFFECTIVE FOURTH QUARTER 2013) AND DVA, MARKETS AND INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A LOWER BENEFIT REFLECTING LOWER RECOVERIES COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS SLIGHTLY DOWN FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

NET INCOME WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER FOR 2013 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN LOAN BALANCES AND THE PROCEEDS FROM A LENDING-RELATED WORKOUT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PURCHASE DISCOUNTS RECOGNIZED ON LOAN REPAYMENTS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME INCREASED IN 2013, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET REVENUE, LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. NET REVENUE INCREASED, DRIVEN BY NET CLIENT INFLOWS, THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS AND NET INTEREST INCOME RESULTING FROM HIGHER LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED, DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT RELATED EXPENSES, HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND COSTS RELATED TO THE CONTROL AGENDA.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

THE PRIOR YEAR NET REVENUE INCLUDED LOSSES FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN THE CIO.

CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS

DURING THE COURSE OF 2013, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ITS CONTROL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION AGENDA AND PUT SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES BEHIND IT. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO THE CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS RELATING TO THE FIRM’S BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS IN THE CIO, AS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO ITS OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES. OTHER SETTLEMENTS DURING THE YEAR INCLUDED THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO IN SEPTEMBER 2013 CONCERNING OVERSIGHT OF THIRD PARTIES, OPERATIONAL PROCESSES AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CREDIT CARD COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PRACTICES AND TO BILLING PRACTICES FOR CREDIT MONITORING PRODUCTS FORMERLY OFFERED BY THE FIRM; THE SETTLEMENTS IN NOVEMBER 2013 OF CERTAIN REPURCHASE REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS BY A GROUP OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL RELATING TO CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM, BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL; THE DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN JANUARY 2014 WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH THE OCC AND FINCEN RELATING TO BERNARD L.

IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENT OF RESTITUTION AND, IN SEVERAL INSTANCES, SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES, THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS REQUIRE THAT THE FIRM MODIFY OR ENHANCE ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ITS MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE AND SERVICING PROCEDURES, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROCEDURES, OVERSIGHT OF THIRD PARTIES, CREDIT CARD LITIGATION PRACTICES, AND RISK MANAGEMENT, MODEL GOVERNANCE, AND OTHER CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO THE CIO AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AT THE FIRM. THE FIRM BELIEVES IT WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

SHAREHOLDERS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE MATTERS, RESOLVE THEM, AND MOVE FORWARD. THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL ALLOW THE FIRM TO FOCUS ON CONTINUING TO SERVE ITS CLIENTS AND COMMUNITIES, AND TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE THE FIRM’S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SEE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ON PAGE

OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT RULES AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT CURRENTLY IS OR WILL SHORTLY BE SUBJECT, AS WELL AS THE MORE NOTEWORTHY RULES AND REGULATIONS CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ON PAGES

1–9

OF THE 2013 FORM 10-K.

HAVING REACHED THE MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS REQUIRED BY THE NEW AND PROPOSED RULES, THE FIRM INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO HOLD EXCESS CAPITAL IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, THE NEW RULES WILL REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MODIFY ITS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO MEET THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICT OR LIMIT THE WAY THE FIRM OFFERS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OR CHARGES FEES FOR SERVICES, EXIT CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND MAKE STRUCTURAL CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH OF ITS LEGAL ENTITIES OFFER CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE MARGIN, EXTRATERRITORIALITY AND CLEARING RULES PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE "DODD-FRANK ACT").

THE FIRM INTENDS TO RESPOND TO THE NEW FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE RESULTING FROM THIS CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO GROW ITS REVENUES OVER TIME, MANAGE ITS EXPENSES, AND COMPLY WITH THE NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INVESTING IN ITS BUSINESSES AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS. INITIATIVES WILL INCLUDE A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS OPTIMIZATION OF THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET. THE FIRM INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE HIGHER U.S. AND BASEL III LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING ALL OF ITS CAPITAL TARGETS IN ADVANCE OF REGULATORY DEADLINES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RETURNING CAPITAL TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM IS ALSO DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON ITS CONTROL AND REGULATORY AGENDAS. IN 2012, IT ESTABLISHED ITS OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTION, WHICH WORKS CLOSELY WITH ALL CONTROL DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE, LEGAL, RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT AND OTHER FUNCTIONS, TO PROVIDE A COHESIVE AND CENTRALIZED VIEW OF CONTROL FUNCTIONS AND ISSUES AND TO ADDRESS COMPLEX CONTROL-RELATED PROJECTS THAT ARE CROSS-LINE OF BUSINESS AND THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY IMPACT OR RESPOND TO REGULATORY ACTIONS SUCH AS THE CONSENT ORDERS. SEE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

155–157

IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTION. THE FIRM’S CONTROL AGENDA IS RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTOR ATTENTION AND OVERSIGHT, AND REPRESENTS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE FIRM, WITH 23 WORK-STREAMS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY INVOLVING MORE THAN 3,500 EMPLOYEES. IN 2013, THE FIRM INCREASED THE AMOUNT SPENT ON THE CONTROL AGENDA BY APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, AND EXPECTS TO SPEND AN INCREMENTAL AMOUNT OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN $1 BILLION ON THE CONTROL AGENDA IN 2014.

THE FIRM IS ALSO EXECUTING A BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION AGENDA THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO FOCUS ON CORE ACTIVITIES FOR ITS CORE CLIENTS AND BETTER MANAGE ITS OPERATIONAL, REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE CEASING STUDENT LOAN ORIGINATIONS, CEASING TO OFFER TRAVELER’S CHECKS AND MONEY ORDERS FOR NON-CUSTOMERS, EXITING CERTAIN HIGH-COMPLEXITY ARRANGEMENTS (SUCH AS THIRD-PARTY LOCKBOX SERVICES), AND BEING MORE SELECTIVE ABOUT ON-BOARDING CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES. THESE BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION CHANGES WILL NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE BREADTH OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS MODEL. HOWEVER, THEY ARE ANTICIPATED TO REDUCE BOTH REVENUES AND EXPENSES OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT ON ANNUALIZED NET INCOME IS EXPECTED TO BE MODEST. IN ADDITION, THE EFFORTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF FREEING UP CAPITAL OVER TIME.

THE FIRM EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE IN THE YEAR AHEAD IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY, AS WELL AS BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

2014 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR 2014 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S. ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. EACH OF THESE INTER-RELATED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS.

THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT NET INTEREST MARGIN WILL BE RELATIVELY STABLE IN THE NEAR TERM.  FIRMWIDE ADJUSTED EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE BELOW $59 BILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR 2014, EXCLUDING FIRMWIDE (CORPORATE AND NON-CORPORATE) LEGAL EXPENSES AND FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS, EVEN AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INVEST IN CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE.

IN THE MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS WITHIN CCB, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REFINANCING VOLUMES AND MARGINS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE PRETAX INCOME OF MORTGAGE PRODUCTION IS ANTICIPATED TO BE MODESTLY NEGATIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. FOR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS WITHIN MORTGAGE BANKING, IF DELINQUENCIES CONTINUE TO TREND DOWN AND THE MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINS STABLE OR IMPROVES, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CHARGE-OFFS TO DECLINE AND A FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

IN CARD SERVICES WITHIN CCB, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT SPREAD COMPRESSION WILL CONTINUE IN 2014; THE SHIFT FROM HIGH-RATE AND LOW-FICO BALANCES IS EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED BY MORE ENGAGED CUSTOMERS OR TRANSACTORS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECT CARD SPEND AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN 2014. IF CURRENT POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS CONTINUE, THE CARD-RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COULD BE REDUCED OVER THE COURSE OF 2014.

THE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED RESULTS FOR CCB DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. HOUSING PRICES OR THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, DO NOT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PORTFOLIOS IN THESE BUSINESSES.

IN PRIVATE EQUITY, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, EARNINGS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND INFLUENCED BY CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, MARKET LEVELS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BROADER ECONOMY AND INVESTMENT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

FOR TREASURY AND CIO, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REINVEST ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, NET INTEREST INCOME IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE AND TO REACH BREAK-EVEN DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2014.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVISORY FEES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CARD INCOME INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME ON CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS AND MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE, DUE TO GROWTH IN SALES VOLUME. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE THE CCB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

86–97

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME DECREASED IN 2013 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES FROM SIGNIFICANT ITEMS RECORDED IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. IN 2013, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED A $1.3 BILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF VISA SHARES, A $493 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF ONE CHASE MANHATTAN PLAZA, AND A MODEST LOSS RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES (“TRUPS”). IN 2012, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED A $1.1 BILLION BENEFIT FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT AND AN $888 MILLION EXTINGUISHMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUPS. THE NET DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE IN CIB, LARGELY FROM CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY.

NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED IN 2013 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE RUNOFF OF HIGHER YIELDING LOANS AND ORIGINATIONS OF LOWER YIELDING LOANS, AND LOWER TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME. THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER FUNDING COSTS. THE FIRM’S AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE

$2.0 TRILLION

IN 2013, AND THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (“FTE”) BASIS, WAS

2.23%

, A DECREASE OF

25

BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2012 WAS

$97.0 BILLION

, DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2011. RESULTS FOR 2012 WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FROM LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO, AND LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME. THESE ITEMS WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME AND HIGHER OTHER INCOME.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 2011, REFLECTING LOWER ADVISORY FEES ON LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SLIGHTLY LOWER EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES ON INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES THAT WERE FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE DECLINES WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY RECORD DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATES.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2011, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO $5.8 BILLION OF LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, AND $449 MILLION OF LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO FROM THE RETAINED INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012; AND ADDITIONAL MODEST LOSSES INCURRED BY CIB FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 2012.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTION REVENUE ALSO INCLUDED A

$930 MILLION

LOSS IN 2012, COMPARED WITH A

$1.4 BILLION

GAIN IN 2011, FROM DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES, RESULTING FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKET-

MAKING REVENUE IN CIB, DRIVEN BY STRONG CLIENT REVENUE AND HIGHER REVENUE IN RATES-RELATED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS A

$665 MILLION

GAIN RECOGNIZED IN OTHER CORPORATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOVERY ON A BEAR STEARNS-RELATED SUBORDINATED LOAN. PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS DECREASED IN 2012, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER UNREALIZED AND REALIZED GAINS ON PRIVATE INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER UNREALIZED GAINS ON PUBLIC SECURITIES.

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DECREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTED LOWER LENDING-RELATED FEES IN CIB AND LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES IN CCB.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE DECREASED FROM 2011, LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS IN CIB. THIS DECREASE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM DRIVEN BY NET CLIENT INFLOWS, THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS, AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE FEES; AND HIGHER INVESTMENT SERVICE FEES IN CCB, AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN SALES OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

SECURITIES GAINS INCREASED, COMPARED WITH THE 2011 LEVEL, REFLECTING THE RESULTS OF REPOSITIONING THE CIO AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011, DUE TO HIGHER MORTGAGE BANKING NET PRODUCTION AND SERVICING REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN NET PRODUCTION REVENUE, REFLECTED WIDER MARGINS DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS; AND HIGHER VOLUMES DUE TO HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES AND THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAMS (“HARP”). THE INCREASE IN NET SERVICING REVENUE RESULTED FROM A FAVORABLE SWING IN RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS RELATED TO MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”), WHICH WAS A GAIN OF

$619 MILLION

IN 2012, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF

$1.6 BILLION

IN 2011.

CARD INCOME DECREASED DURING 2012, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEBIT CARD REVENUE, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DURBIN AMENDMENT; AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS. THE DECREASE IN CREDIT CARD INCOME WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD SALES VOLUME, AND HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, LARGELY DUE TO A

$1.1 BILLION

BENEFIT FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT, AND

$888 MILLION

OF EXTINGUISHMENT GAINS IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUPS. THE EXTINGUISHMENT GAINS WERE RELATED TO ADJUSTMENTS APPLIED TO THE COST BASIS OF THE TRUPS DURING THE PERIOD THEY WERE IN A QUALIFIED HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIP. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR-YEAR GAIN ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTMENT IN AM.

NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER AVERAGE TRADING ASSET BALANCES, THE RUNOFF OF HIGHER-YIELDING LOANS, FASTER PREPAYMENT OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, LIMITED REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE FIRM’S INTEREST-EARNING

72

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD LOANS, WHICH REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE NON-PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AS DELINQUENCY TRENDS IMPROVED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHARGE-OFFS OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS. A HIGHER LEVEL OF RECOVERIES AND LOWER CHARGE-OFFS IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, LARGELY DUE TO A SMALLER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

, UP BY

$5.7

BILLION, OR

, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSE.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2013 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FRONT OFFICE SALES AND SUPPORT STAFF, AS WELL AS COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRM’S CONTROL AGENDA; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN CIB AND A DECLINE IN CCB’S MORTGAGE BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF LOWER SERVICING HEADCOUNT.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2013 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER OTHER EXPENSE, REFLECTING

$11.1 BILLION

OF FIRMWIDE LEGAL EXPENSE, PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, REPRESENTING ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR SEVERAL LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, COMPARED WITH

$5.0 BILLION

OF EXPENSE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, HIGHER LEGAL-RELATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE, AND COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRM’S CONTROL AGENDA ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING EXPENSE IN CCB AND LOWER OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FOR THE FIRM, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTED THE ABSENCE OF CHARGES RECOGNIZED IN 2012 RELATED TO VACATING EXCESS SPACE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2012 WAS

$64.7

BILLION , UP BY $1.8 BILLION, OR 3%, FROM 2011. COMPENSATION EXPENSE DROVE THE INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE SALES FORCE IN CCB AND BANKERS IN THE OTHER BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN CIB.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR 2012 INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING BRANCH BUILDS IN CCB; HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME IN CIB AND CCB; HIGHER REGULATORY DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS; EXPENSES RELATED TO EXITING A NON-CORE PRODUCT AND WRITING-OFF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN CCB; AND HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSE IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LEGAL EXPENSE IN AM AND CCB (INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT) AND LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE IN CCB.

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSE RELATED TO LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IN 2013. THIS WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME IN COMBINATION WITH CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME AND EXPENSE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, BUSINESS TAX CREDITS, TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR YEAR TAX ADJUSTMENTS AND AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REPORTED PRETAX INCOME AND LOWER BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS.

, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE SPECIFIC LINE ITEM CAPTIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS DURING 2013.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS

THE NET INCREASE REFLECTED THE PLACEMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS FUNDS WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PREDOMINANTLY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

168–173

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; AND SECURITIES BORROWED

THE DECREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

–

DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS WAS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT SECURITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES WAS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVELS OF SHORT POSITIONS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

–

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AND REDUCTIONS IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVES DUE TO MARKET MOVEMENTS. THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EQUITY DERIVATIVES DRIVEN BY A RISE IN EQUITY MARKETS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON PAGES

135–136

, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES

195–215

AND

220–233

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

THE DECREASE IN SECURITIES WAS LARGELY DUE TO REPOSITIONING WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER LEVELS OF CORPORATE DEBT, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MBS. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVELS OF U.S. TREASURY AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT ON PAGES

109–111

, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES

195–215

AND

249–254

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

LOANS INCREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN WHOLESALE LOANS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CONSUMER,

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

75

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD LOANS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW MORTGAGE AND AUTO ORIGINATIONS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED AS A RESULT OF A

$5.5 BILLION

REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED HOME PRICES ON THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AND IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

, AND NOTES 3, 4, 14 AND 15 ON PAGES

195–215

,

215–218

,

258–283

AND

284–287

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

THE INCREASE IN PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT WAS LARGELY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN CBB IN THE U.S. AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES GLOBALLY.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

THE INCREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO ORIGINATIONS AND CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COLLECTION/REALIZATION OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, DISPOSITIONS, AND CHANGES IN VALUATION DUE TO MODEL INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

299–304

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER ASSETS

THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GROSS INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN U.S. COUNTERPARTIES FOR EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES (“ETD”), HIGHER ETD MARGIN BALANCES, AND MANDATORY CLEARING FOR CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN THE U.S.

DEPOSITS

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO GROWTH IN BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES WAS DUE TO HIGHER SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN CLIENT OPERATING BALANCES. CONSUMER DEPOSIT BALANCES INCREASED FROM THE EFFECT OF CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSUMER DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE CCB SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

86–97

; THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

,

103–105

AND

98–102

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE DECREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING SOURCES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES

168–173

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

COMMERCIAL PAPER INCREASED SLIGHTLY DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE FROM WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS  AND AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES RELATED TO CIB’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, WHEREBY CLIENTS CHOOSE TO SWEEP THEIR DEPOSITS INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER. OTHER BORROWED FUNDS INCREASED SLIGHTLY DUE TO HIGHER SECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, SEE PAGES

168–173

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 20 ON PAGE

305

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO UNWINDS OF MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, NET CREDIT CARD MATURITIES AND A REDUCTION IN OUTSTANDING CONDUIT COMMERCIAL PAPER HELD BY THIRD PARTIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FIRM-SPONSORED VIES AND LOAN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

288–299

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET ISSUANCES, WHICH ALSO REFLECTED THE REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

168–173

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY INCREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET INCOME; NET ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK; AND THE ISSUANCES AND COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE UNDER THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND A NET DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NET DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY ISSUED MBS AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES DUE TO MARKET CHANGES, AS WELL AS NET REALIZED GAINS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ACTIONS, SEE CAPITAL ACTIONS ON PAGES

166–167

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED ON-BALANCE SHEET, WHILE OTHERS ARE OFF-BALANCE SHEET UNDER U.S. GAAP. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF–BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGH NONCONSOLIDATED SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (“SPES”), WHICH ARE A TYPE OF VIE, AND THROUGH LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS AN SPE. SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-B

A

CKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, AS THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS’ ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SPES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

288–299

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE TYPES OF SPES.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARM’S LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRM’S CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY “P-1”, “A-1” AND “F1” FOR MOODY’S, STANDARD & POOR’S AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS SUPPORT THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER BY BOTH FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED AND THIRD-PARTY

SPONSORED NONCONSOLIDATED SPES. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ABSENT OTHER SOLUTIONS, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE SPE, IF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER COULD NOT BE REISSUED AS IT MATURED. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMER-CIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, ISSUED BY BOTH FIRM-ADMINISTERED AND THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED SPES, THAT ARE HELD BY THIRD PARTIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, WAS $15.5 BILLION

AND

$18.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING COULD INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD CLIENTS OF THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED OR THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED NONCONSOLIDATED SPES DRAW DOWN ON CERTAIN UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMIT-MENTS WERE

$9.2 BILLION

AND

$10.9 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE REFINANCING OF SOME OF THE CLIENTS’ ASSETS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FUNDING OBLIGATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES

292–293

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTS AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. THE FIRM’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

288–299

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ON PAGE

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC (THE “GSES”) AND OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS MADE REPRESENT

ATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM HAS BEEN, AND MAY BE, REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE GSES (E.G., WITH “MAKE-WHOLE” PAYMENTS TO REIMBURSE THE GSES FOR REALIZED LOSSES ON LIQUIDATED LOANS) AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS

AND WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT ARE RECEIVED RELATE TO LOANS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES THAT REMAIN VIABLE, THE FIRM TYPICALLY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE THIRD PARTY.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS DECREASED

$14.0 BILLION

AND

$5.9 BILLION

, AND INCREASED $32.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASE’S CASH FLOWS DURING

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE. OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE FIRM’S OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$108.0 BILLION

, AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN NET INCOME. THIS RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS - DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT SECURITIES; AND AN INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES – DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVELS OF SHORT POSITIONS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALSO REFLECTED ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCASH ITEMS SUCH AS DEFERRED TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WAS CASH USED FOR LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL, WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF THE LOANS, AND ALSO REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS OF ACTIVITIES OVER THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $25.1 BILLION. THIS RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED REFLECTING A SHIFT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS CASH TO RESALE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY IN CIB, AND LOWER TRADING ASSETS - DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WAS A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER CIB CLIENT BALANCES, AND AN INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS - DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB. NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCASH ITEMS SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. CASH USED TO ACQUIRE LOANS WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF SUCH LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED WITH AN

INITIAL INTENT TO SELL, AND ALSO REFLECTED A LOWER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $95.9 BILLION, AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN NET INCOME. THIS RESULTED FROM A NET DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES – DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB; AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER CIB CLIENT BALANCES, AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY IN CIB, DRIVEN BY A LARGE REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER MARGIN RECEIVABLES DUE TO CHANGES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY. NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALSO REFLECTED ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCASH ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROVIDED FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WAS HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WAS AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED, PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE DUE TO HIGHER EXCESS CASH POSITIONS AT YEAR-END.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE LOANS ORIGINATED TO BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, NET CASH OF

$150.5 BILLION

WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING THE PLACEMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS FUNDS WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PREDOMINANTLY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS; AND CONTINUED GROWTH OF WHOLESALE LOANS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS CASH OUTFLOW WAS A DECREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY; A DECREASE IN CONSUMER LOANS EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD LOANS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW MORTGAGE AND AUTO ORIGINATIONS; AND PROCEEDS FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES WHICH WERE HIGHER THAN THE CASH USED TO ACQUIRE NEW INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, NET CASH OF $119.8 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS DUE TO DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY; HIGHER DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING PLACEMENTS OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PRIMARILY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS; AND HIGHER LEVELS OF WHOLESALE LOANS, PRIMARILY IN CB AND AM, DRIVEN BY HIGHER WHOLESALE ACTIVITY ACROSS MOST OF THE FIRM’S REGIONS AND BUSINESSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE A DECLINE IN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOANS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO MORTGAGE-RELATED PAYDOWNS AND PORTFOLIO RUNOFF, AND A DECLINE IN CREDIT CARD LOANS DUE TO HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES; AND PROCEEDS FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF AFS SECURITIES,

80

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

WHICH WERE HIGHER THAN THE CASH USED TO ACQUIRE NEW AFS SECURITIES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH OF $170.8 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING THE PLACEMENT OF FUNDS WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS, PREDOMINANTLY RESULTING FROM THE OVERALL GROWTH IN WHOLESALE CLIENT DEPOSITS; AN INCREASE IN LOANS REFLECTING CONTINUED GROWTH IN CLIENT ACTIVITY ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES AND REGIONS; NET PURCHASES OF AFS SECURITIES, LARGELY DUE TO REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO IN CORPORATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT; AND AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE DUE TO HIGHER EXCESS CASH POSITIONS AT YEAR-END. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE A DECLINE IN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOAN BALANCES DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND PORTFOLIO RUNOFF, AND IN CREDIT CARD LOANS, DUE TO HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES, RUNOFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO AND THE FIRM’S SALE OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S FINANCING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE TAKING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, AND ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT AS WELL AS PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS

$28.3 BILLION

. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS; NET ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, WHICH ALSO REFLECTED THE REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013; AND PROCEEDS FROM THE NET ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE CLIENT DEPOSIT BALANCES WAS DUE TO HIGHER SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN CLIENT OPERATING BALANCES. CONSUMER DEPOSIT BALANCES INCREASED FROM THE EFFECT OF CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WAS A DECREASE IN SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING SOURCES; REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK; AND PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $87.7 BILLION. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS; AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS DUE TO GROWTH IN BOTH CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS; AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DUE TO HIGHER SECURED FINANCINGS OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS; AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE IN THE WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF CLIENT DEPOSITS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY BALANCES RELATED TO CIB’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT; AN INCREASE IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS DUE TO HIGHER SECURED AND UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS; AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE

REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, AND SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS; AND PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $107.7 BILLION. THIS WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEPOSITS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO AN OVERALL GROWTH IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CONSUMER DEPOSIT BALANCES. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES, PARTICULARLY IN CIB AND CB, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER RETURNS ON OTHER AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS AND LOW INTEREST RATES DURING 2011, AND IN AM, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS AND LEVEL OF DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER DUE TO GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES IN SWEEP ACCOUNTS RELATED TO CIB’S CASH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. CASH WAS USED TO REDUCE SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY IN CIB, REFLECTING THE LOWER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRM BASED ON LOWER TRADING INVENTORY LEVELS, AND CHANGE IN THE MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES; FOR NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING A DECREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN LONG-TERM BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES DUE TO MATURITIES OF FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; TO REDUCE OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY MATURITIES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED BORROWINGS, UNSECURED BANK NOTES AND SHORT-TERM FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS ("FHLB") ADVANCES; AND FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS, AND PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S.(“U.S. GAAP”); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES

184–188

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS “REPORTED” BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRM’S RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES’ U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRM’S RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRM’S RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS ON A “MANAGED” BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FIRM (AND EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS) ON A FTE BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS PRESENTED IN

THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE OR BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND, THEREFORE, FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS. NON- GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE FIRM MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRM’S REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

PREDOMINANTLY RECOGNIZED IN CIB AND CB BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (“TCE”), ROTCE, TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE (“TBVS”), AND TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I AND III RULES ARE EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TCE REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (I.E., TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK) LESS GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN MSRS), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ROTCE MEASURES THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TCE. TBVS REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY DIVIDED BY PERIOD-END COMMON SHARES. TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I AND III RULES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT, ALONG WITH OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES, TO ASSESS AND MONITOR THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION. TCE, ROTCE, AND TBVS ARE MEANINGFUL TO THE FIRM, AS WELL AS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS, IN ASSESSING THE FIRM’S USE OF EQUITY. THE FIRM USES ROTCE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO EVALUATE ITS USE OF EQUITY AND TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS WITH COMPETITORS.

THE CORE DATA PRESENTED BELOW ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF CIB’S MARKET-BASED NET INTEREST INCOME AND THE RELATED ASSETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS EXCLUSION PROVIDES INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE BY WHICH TO ANALYZE THE NON-MARKET-RELATED BUSINESS TRENDS OF THE FIRM AND PROVIDES A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON CORE LENDING, INVESTING AND DEPOSIT-RAISING ACTIVITIES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS BASIS. THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS – CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING, CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER

SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ON PAGES

82–83

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRM’S CLIENTS, THE PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO THE TREASURY GROUP WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE

TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, AND AS COMPARED WITH ITS STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (“ALCO”).

BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION CHANGES

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER COMPARISONS, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (AS ESTIMATED UNDER BASEL III) AND ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013, THE FIRM REFINED THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK TO ALIGN IT WITH THE LINE OF BUSINESS STRUCTURE DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN EQUITY LEVELS FOR THE LINES OF BUSINESSES IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY EVOLVING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND THE HIGHER CAPITAL TARGETS THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE CAPITAL CHANGES, SEE LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGES

165–166

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, OR ANOTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT, THE COSTS OF THOSE SERVICES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS GENERALLY ALLOCATED BASED ON ACTUAL COST AND UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED EXPENSE INCLUDES: PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH A PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

THE CURRENT YEAR REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN REPURCHASE LIABILITY LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE GSES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY ON PAGES

78–79

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE SERVICING

PRETAX LOSS WAS $372 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A PRETAX LOSS OF $1.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”) RISK MANAGEMENT LOSS. MORTGAGE NET SERVICING-RELATED REVENUE WAS $2.9 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $88 MILLION. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT WAS A LOSS OF $268 MILLION, COMPARED WITH INCOME OF $616 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY THE NET IMPACT OF VARIOUS CHANGES IN MODEL INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

299–304

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET AND RELATED HEDGES.

SERVICING EXPENSE WAS $3.0 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $1.8 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW AND LOWER SERVICING HEADCOUNT.

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

PRETAX INCOME WAS $4.7 BILLION, UP $1.7 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO A HIGHER BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. NET REVENUE WAS $3.5 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $580 MILLION, OR 14%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME, RESULTING FROM LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO NET PORTFOLIO RUNOFF, AND LOWER NONINTEREST REVENUE DUE TO HIGHER LOAN RETENTION. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $2.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $509 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $3.8 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, $2.3 BILLION FROM THE NON CREDIT-IMPAIRED ALLOWANCE AND $1.5 BILLION FROM THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED ALLOWANCE, REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND DELINQUENCIES.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

MORTGAGE PRODUCTION

PRETAX INCOME WAS $3.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.6 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION-RELATED REVENUE, EXCLUDING REPURCHASE LOSSES, WAS $6.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.3 BILLION, OR 55%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED WIDER MARGINS, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS, AND HIGHER VOLUMES DUE TO HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES AND THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAMS (“HARP”). PRODUCTION EXPENSE, INCLUDING CREDIT COSTS, WAS $2.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $852 MILLION, OR 45%, REFLECTING HIGHER VOLUMES AND ADDITIONAL LITIGATION COSTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

91

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”) ASSET AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF LOWER MSR ASSET VALUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOAN SERVICING REVENUE DUE TO THE DECLINE IN THE THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT INCOME WAS $616 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $1.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIOR YEAR MSR RISK MANAGEMENT LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY REFINEMENTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL AND RELATED INPUTS. SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

299–304

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET AND RELATED HEDGES. SERVICING EXPENSE WAS $4.7 BILLION, DOWN 2% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, BUT ELEVATED IN BOTH THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DEFAULT SERVICING COSTS.

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

PRETAX INCOME WAS $2.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A PRETAX LOSS OF $504 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY A BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT TRENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. NET REVENUE WAS $4.1 BILLION, DOWN $500 MILLION, OR 11%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO NET PORTFOLIO RUNOFF. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED A BENEFIT OF $509 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A PROVISION EXPENSE OF $3.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $3.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE NON CREDIT-IMPAIRED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. CURRENT-YEAR NET CHARGE-OFFS TOTALED $3.3 BILLION, INCLUDING $744 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL CHARGE-OFFS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE ON CERTAIN LOANS DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY, COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

120–129

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF AMOUNTS AND RATES. NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE $7.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.9 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY GUIDANCE, NONACCRUAL LOANS WOULD HAVE BEEN $4.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE REPORTING OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS AND PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AS NONACCRUAL, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

120–129

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.7 BILLION, UP $132 MILLION, OR 9%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SERVICING COSTS.

PCI LOANS

INCLUDED WITHIN REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS ARE PCI LOANS THAT THE FIRM ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. FOR PCI LOANS, THE EXCESS OF THE UNDISCOUNTED GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOANS (THE “ACCRETABLE YIELD”) IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE LOANS.

THE NET SPREAD BETWEEN THE PCI LOANS AND THE RELATED LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER TIME, EXCEPT FOR ANY BASIS RISK OR OTHER RESIDUAL INTEREST RATE RISK THAT REMAINS AND FOR CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE (E.G., FROM EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS

AND FROM PREPAYMENTS). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF THE PCI LOAN PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO BE

8

YEARS. THE LOAN BALANCES ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE MORE RAPIDLY OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS THE MOST TROUBLED LOANS ARE LIQUIDATED, AND MORE SLOWLY THEREAFTER AS THE REMAINING TROUBLED BORROWERS HAVE LIMITED REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. SIMILARLY, DEFAULT AND SERVICING EXPENSE ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND DECLINE OVER TIME AS LIQUIDATIONS SLOW DOWN.

MORTGAGE SERVICING-RELATED MATTERS

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS OF 1-4 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS. SUCH LOANS REQUIRED VARYING DEGREES OF LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. FORECLOSURE IS USUALLY A LAST RESORT, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS MADE, AND CONTINUES TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO HELP BORROWERS REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES.

THE FIRM HAS A WELL-DEFINED FORECLOSURE PREVENTION PROCESS WHEN A BORROWER FAILS TO PAY ON HIS OR HER LOAN. THE FIRM MAKES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS, IN VARIOUS WAYS, TO CONTACT THE BORROWER IN AN EFFORT TO PURSUE HOME RETENTION OR OPTIONS OTHER THAN FORECLOSURE. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTACT A BORROWER, THE FIRM COMPLETES VARIOUS REVIEWS OF THE BORROWER’S FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE A FORECLOSURE SALE IS COMPLETED. OVER THE LAST YEAR, THE AVERAGE DELINQUENCY PERIOD FOR THE BORROWER AT THE TIME OF FORECLOSURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 28 MONTHS.

THE HIGH VOLUME OF DELINQUENT AND DEFAULTED MORTGAGES EXPERIENCED DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS PLACED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS ON SERVICING OPERATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY. THE GSES IMPOSE COMPENSATORY FEES ON MORTGAGE SERVICERS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, IF SUCH SERVICERS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE FORECLOSURE TIMETABLES MANDATED BY THE GSES. THE FIRM HAS INCURRED, AND CONTINUES TO INCUR, COMPENSATORY FEES, WHICH ARE REPORTED IN DEFAULT SERVICING EXPENSE. THE FIRM HAS MADE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO AND REFINE ITS MORTGAGE OPERATIONS TO ADDRESS MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOSS MITIGATION, AND FORECLOSURE ISSUES.

SINCE 2011, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND PRIVATE PARTIES RELATED TO MORTGAGE SERVICING, ORIGINATION, AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ACTIVITIES.  THE TERMS OF THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS VARY, BUT IN GENERAL, REQUIRED CASH COMPENSATORY PAYMENTS OR FINES AND/OR “BORROWER RELIEF,” INCLUDING PRINCIPAL REDUCTIONS, REFINANCING, SHORT SALE ASSISTANCE, AND OTHER SPECIFIED TYPES OF BORROWER RELIEF.  THE FIRM HAS SATISFIED OR IS COMMITTED TO SATISFYING THESE OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE MANDATED TIMEFRAMES.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED UNDER CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, AS WELL AS UNDER NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDE ENHANCED MORTGAGE SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE STANDARDS AND PROCESSES.  AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES, THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED A NEW CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE SPECIALIST ORGANIZATION TO SERVE AS A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR BORROWERS REQUIRING ASSISTANCE IN THE FORECLOSURE OR LOSS MITIGATION PROCESS; IMPLEMENTED SPECIFIC CONTROLS ON  “DUAL TRACKING” OF FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES; STRENGTHENED ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM TO ENSURE MORTGAGE SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE OPERATIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS; AND MADE TECHNOLOGICAL ENHANCEMENTS TO AUTOMATE AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT, PAYMENT PROCESSING, TRAINING, AND  SKILLS

CARD, MERCHANT SERVICES & AUTO

NET INCOME WAS $4.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $779 MILLION, OR 19%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

NET REVENUE WAS $18.7 BILLION, FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.4 BILLION, DOWN $309 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPREAD COMPRESSION IN CREDIT CARD AND AUTO AND LOWER AVERAGE CREDIT CARD LOAN BALANCES, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS IN CREDIT CARD. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $5.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $229 MILLION, OR 4%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, AUTO LEASE INCOME AND MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE FROM AN EXITED NON-CORE PRODUCT AND A GAIN ON AN INVESTMENT SECURITY RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $4.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A $1.7 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES REFLECTING IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND RESTRUCTURED LOAN PERFORMANCE. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED A $1.6 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 3.14%, DOWN FROM 3.95% IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 1.67%, DOWN FROM 2.10% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE AUTO NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 0.31%, DOWN FROM 0.39% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.1 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $138 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE IS DUE TO ONE-TIME EXPENSE ITEMS RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR RELATED TO THE EXIT OF A NON-CORE PRODUCT AND THE WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH A NON-STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP. THE REDUCTION IN EXPENSES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED AUTO LEASE DEPRECIATION AND PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS REQUIRED BY A REGULATORY CONSENT ORDER DURING 2013.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

CARD, MERCHANT SERVICES & AUTO

NET INCOME WAS $4.0 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $537 MILLION, OR 12%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET REVENUE AND HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

NET REVENUE WAS $18.8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $371 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.7 BILLION, DOWN $580 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS AND LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $5.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $209 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, INCLUDING LOWER PARTNER REVENUE-SHARING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO SALE ON APRIL 1, 2011

,

AND HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A $1.6 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED A $3.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 3.95%, DOWN FROM 5.44% IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 2.10%, DOWN FROM 2.81% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 3.88% ABSENT A POLICY CHANGE ON RESTRUCTURED LOANS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS. THE AUTO NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 0.39%, UP FROM 0.32% IN THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDING $53 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO REGULATORY GUIDANCE. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGE-OFFS, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 0.28%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $171 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY EXPENSES RELATED TO A NON-CORE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING EXITED AND THE WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH A NON-STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

CIB PROVIDES SEVERAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WHICH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FVA (EFFECTIVE FOURTH QUARTER 2013) AND DVA ON: NET REVENUE, NET INCOME, COMPENSATION RATIO, OVERHEAD RATIO, AND RETURN ON EQUITY. THE RATIO FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO END-OF-PERIOD LOANS IS CALCULATED EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CONSOLIDATED FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND TRADE FINANCE, TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF CIB’S ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIO. THESE MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS AND FOR COMPARABILITY WITH PEERS.

2013 COMPARED WITH 2012

NET INCOME WAS $8.6 BILLION, UP 2% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE WAS $34.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $34.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR’S FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDED A $1.5 BILLION LOSS AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING A FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (“FVA”) FRAMEWORK FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES. THE FVA FRAMEWORK INCORPORATES THE IMPACT OF FUNDING INTO THE FIRM’S VALUATION ESTIMATES FOR OTC DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES AND REFLECTS AN INDUSTRY MIGRATION TOWARDS INCORPORATING THE MARKET COST OF UNSECURED FUNDING IN THE VALUATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS. THE LOSS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 IS A ONE-TIME ADJUSTMENT ARISING ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FVA FRAMEWORK. IN FUTURE PERIODS THE FIRM WILL INCORPORATE FVA IN ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR OTC DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES FROM THE DATE OF INITIAL RECOGNITION.

NET REVENUE ALSO INCLUDED A $452 MILLION LOSS FROM DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $930 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FVA (EFFECTIVE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013) AND DVA, NET REVENUE WAS $36.1 BILLION AND NET INCOME WAS $9.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $35.3 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY.

BANKING REVENUES WERE $12.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $11.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE $6.3 BILLION, UP 10% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $1.5 BILLION (UP 46%) AND RECORD DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $3.5 BILLION (UP 8%), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVISORY FEES OF $1.3 BILLION (DOWN 12%). EQUITY UNDERWRITING RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER INDUSTRY-WIDE ISSUANCE AND AN INCREASE IN THE FIRM’S WALLET SHARE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, ACCORDING TO DEALOGIC. INDUSTRY-WIDE LOAN SYNDICATION VOLUMES AND WALLET INCREASED AS THE LOW RATE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO FUEL REFINANCING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM ALSO RANKED #1 IN WALLET AND VOLUMES SHARES ACROSS HIGH GRADE, HIGH YIELD AND LOAN PRODUCTS. ADVISORY FEES WERE LOWER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED M&A WALLET DECLINED 13%. THE FIRM MAINTAINED ITS #2 RANKING AND IMPROVED SHARE FOR BOTH ANNOUNCED AND COMPLETED VOLUMES DURING THE PERIOD.

TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE WAS $4.1 BILLION, DOWN 3% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER TRADE FINANCE SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME ON HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. LENDING REVENUE WAS

$1.6 BILLION, UP FROM $1.3 BILLION, IN THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTING NET INTEREST INCOME ON RETAINED LOANS, FEES ON LENDING RELATED COMMITMENTS, AS WELL AS GAINS

O

N SECURITIES RECEIVED FROM RESTRUCTURED LOANS.

MARKETS AND INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE WAS $22.2 BILLION COMPARED TO $23.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. COMBINED FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $20.2 BILLION, UP FROM $19.8 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE OF $15.5 BILLION WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER REFLECTING CONSISTENTLY STRONG CLIENT REVENUE AND LOWER LOSSES FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATES-RELATED REVENUE GIVEN AN UNCERTAIN RATE OUTLOOK AND LOW SPREAD ENVIRONMENT. EQUITIES MARKETS REVENUE OF $4.8 BILLION WAS UP 8% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUE IN DERIVATIVES AND CASH EQUITIES PRODUCTS AS WELL AS PRIME SERVICES PRIMARILY ON HIGHER BALANCES. SECURITIES SERVICES REVENUE WAS $4.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH $4.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR ON HIGHER CUSTODY AND FUND SERVICES REVENUE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY RECORD ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY OF $20.5 TRILLION. CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS & OTHER WAS A LOSS OF $2.1 BILLION PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY FVA (EFFECTIVE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013) AND DVA.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $232 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $479 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTED LOWER RECOVERIES AS COMPARED TO 2012 AS THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS. NET RECOVERIES WERE $78 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $284 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTING A CONTINUED FAVORABLE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT WITH STABLE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS. NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE DOWN 57% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $21.7 BILLION WAS SLIGHTLY DOWN COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OFFSET BY HIGHER NON COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMPENSATION RATIO, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DVA AND FVA WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, WAS 30% AND 32% FOR 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 15% ON $56.5 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL AND 17% EXCLUDING FVA (EFFECTIVE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013) AND DVA.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

NET INCOME WAS $8.4 BILLION, UP 5% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET REVENUE COMPARED WITH 2011, LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND A LARGER BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. NET REVENUE WAS $34.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $34.0 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET REVENUE INCLUDED A $930 MILLION LOSS FROM DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DVA, NET REVENUE WAS $35.3 BILLION AND NET INCOME WAS $9.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $32.5 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY.

BANKING REVENUES WERE $11.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $10.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

$5.8 BILLION, DOWN 2% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR; THESE CONSISTED OF RECORD DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $3.3 BILLION (UP 13%), ADVISORY FEES OF $1.5 BILLION (DOWN 17%) AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $1.0 BILLION (DOWN 13%). INDUSTRY-WIDE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS VOLUMES WERE AT THEIR SECOND HIGHEST ANNUAL LEVEL SINCE 2006, AS THE LOW RATE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO FUEL ISSUANCE AND REFINANCING ACTIVITY. IN CONTRAST THERE WAS LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE ANNOUNCED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ACTIVITY, WHILE INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY UNDERWRITING VOLUMES REMAINED STEADY. TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE WAS A RECORD $4.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY CONTINUED DEPOSIT BALANCE GROWTH AND HIGHER AVERAGE TRADE LOANS OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. LENDING REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME ON INCREASED AVERAGE RETAINED LOANS AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FAIR VALUE LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK-RELATED HEDGES OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO.

MARKETS AND INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE WAS $23.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $23.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. COMBINED FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $19.8 BILLION, UP FROM $19.3 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR AS CLIENT REVENUE REMAINED STRONG ACROSS MOST PRODUCTS, WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTH IN RATES-RELATED PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. 2012 GENERALLY SAW CREDIT SPREAD TIGHTENING AND LOWER VOLATILITY IN BOTH THE CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DURING WHICH MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE EUROZONE, CAUSED CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING AND GENERALLY MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. SECURITIES SERVICES REVENUE WAS $4.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.9 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY GREW TO A RECORD $18.8 TRILLION BY THE END OF 2012, DRIVEN BY BOTH MARKET APPRECIATION AS WELL AS NET INFLOWS. CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS & OTHER WAS A LOSS OF $841 MILLION, DRIVEN PREDOMINANTLY BY DVA, WHICH WAS A LOSS OF $930 MILLION DUE TO THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $479 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $285 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS CREDIT TRENDS REMAINED STABLE. THE 2012 BENEFIT REFLECTED RECOVERIES AND A NET REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS, CREDIT TRENDS AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES. NET RECOVERIES WERE $284 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $161 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE DOWN 35% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.9 BILLION, DOWN 1%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 18% ON $47.5 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF RISK TYPES ARE CONSIDERED IN MANAGING ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES.

•

ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY BY ALL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE FIRM;

•

OWNERSHIP OF RISK MANAGEMENT WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS; AND

•

FIRMWIDE STRUCTURES FOR RISK GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN AND MANAGED ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. THE FIRM’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”), CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (“CFO”), CHIEF RISK OFFICER (“CRO”) AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (“COO”) DEVELOP AND SET THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR THE FIRM WHICH IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE

FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO CREATE A CULTURE OF RISK TRANSPARENCY AND AWARENESS, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE FIRM WHERE COLLABORATION, DISCUSSION, ESCALATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION ARE ENCOURAGED. THE CEO, CFO, CRO AND COO ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTOR’S.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT RISK MANAGEMENT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY EMPLOYEE. EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY AND IDENTIFY, ESCALATE, AND CORRECT MISTAKES. THE FIRM’S RISK CULTURE STRIVES FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT THROUGH ONGOING EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS TALENT RETENTION. THE FIRM ALSO APPROACHES ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH AN INTEGRATED RISK, COMPENSATION AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK TO ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS AND PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE FIRM’S OVERALL OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING RISK IS TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE FIRM, AND AVOID EXCESSIVE RISK TAKING.

RISK GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF RISK PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ RISK POLICY COMMITTEE (“DRPC”), AUDIT COMMITTEE AND, WITH RESPECT TO COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION & MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE.

THE FIRM’S OVERALL RISK APPETITE IS ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FIRM’S CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONS, EARNINGS POWER, AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS MODEL. THE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK IS A TOOL TO MEASURE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE RISK AND IS EXPRESSED IN LOSS TOLERANCE PARAMETERS AT THE FIRM AND/OR LOB LEVELS, INCLUDING NET INCOME LOSS TOLERANCES, LIQUIDITY LIMITS AND MARKET LIMITS.   PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE PARAMETERS INFORMS MANAGEMENT'S STRATEGIC DECISIONS AND IS REPORTED TO THE DRPC.

THE FIRM-LEVEL RISK APPETITE PARAMETERS ARE SET AND APPROVED BY THE FIRM’S CEO, CFO, CRO AND COO. LOB-LEVEL RISK APPETITE PARAMETERS ARE SET BY THE LOB CEO, CFO, AND CRO AND ARE APPROVED BY THE FIRM’S FUNCTIONAL HEADS AS NOTED ABOVE. FIRMWIDE LOB DIVERSIFICATION ALLOWS THE SUM OF THE LOBS’ LOSS TOLERANCES TO BE GREATER THAN THE FIRMWIDE LOSS TOLERANCE.

THE CRO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION AND IS THE HEAD OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. THE LOBS AND LEGAL ENTITIES ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE RISKS INHERENT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION AND OTHER FIRMWIDE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES (I.E., REGULATORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE (“RCMO”), OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP, VALUATION CONTROL GROUP (“VCG”), LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE) PROVIDE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE MONITORING, EVALUATION AND ESCALATION OF RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. IN ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD, AUTO, BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LENDING BUSINESSES. ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS ARE RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, OR SECURITIZED OR SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES; OTHER TYPES OF CONSUMER LOANS ARE TYPICALLY RETAINED ON BALANCE SHEET. IN ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS UNDERWRITING, LENDING AND DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES WITH AND FOR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH ITS OPERATING SERVICES ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES. A PORTION OF THE LOANS ORIGINATED OR ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET; THE FIRM’S SYNDICATED LOAN BUSINESS DISTRIBUTES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKET AND IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.

•

ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LINE APPROVAL

•

ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE

•

MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES AND DELINQUENT LOANS

•

DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURES ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS. TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER VERSUS WHOLESALE), RISK MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK-RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT OF AN OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY, THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT AND THE EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CREDIT LOSSES FOR ITS EXPOSURES. PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOAN

PORTFOLIOS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AND PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES

284–287

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL AND REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE ESTABLISHED ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ANALYSES FOR THESE LOSSES INCLUDE STRESS TESTING (CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS) AS DESCRIBED IN THE STRESS TESTING SECTION BELOW.

THE METHODOLOGIES USED TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES DEPEND ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CREDIT EXPOSURE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SCORED EXPOSURE

THE SCORED PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY HELD IN CCB AND INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, CREDIT CARD LOANS, CERTAIN AUTO AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, AND STUDENT LOANS. FOR THE SCORED PORTFOLIO, CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME AND ARE ESTIMATED USING PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING, AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS, WHICH CONSIDER LOAN LEVEL FACTORS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT SCORES, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. CREDIT LOSS ANALYSES ALSO CONSIDER, AS APPROPRIATE, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. THE FACTORS AND ANALYSIS ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS MARKET CONDITIONS DICTATE.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE GENERALLY HELD IN CIB, CB AND AM, BUT ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO DEALER LOANS HELD IN CCB THAT ARE RISK-RATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL LOANS. FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIO, CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT. THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BEGINS WITH RISK-RATINGS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH LOAN FACILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. THESE RISK-RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE BORROWER’S CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION, RISK PROFILE AND RELATED COLLATERAL. THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL DEFAULT AND NOT BE FULLY REPAID BY THE BORROWER. THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS ESTIMATED FOR EACH BORROWER, AND A LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT IS ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THE CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

STRESS TESTING

STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE FIRM. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, AND THE STRESS TEST RESULTS MAY INDICATE CREDIT MIGRATION, CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND POTENTIAL LOSSES IN THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION TO THE PERIODIC STRESS TESTING PROCESSES, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS, AS NECESSARY. THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTING TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS ON SETTING RISK APPETITE BOTH AT A FIRM AND LINE OF BUSINESS LEVEL, AS WELL AS FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS.

RISK MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT TO ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN MODELS, ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN EVALUATING AND MONITORING CREDIT RISK ARE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATED BY GROUPS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE LINE OF BUSINESSES.

FOR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS, INCLUDING ANY CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, ARE MONITORED, AS CERTAIN OF THESE TRENDS CAN BE MODIFIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER RISK MANAGEMENT EVALUATES DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS, CURRENT AND FORECASTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE EMPLOYED FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM OR PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DEFERRAL AND OTHER ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND AVOID FORECLOSURE. HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED TRENDS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE MODELING OF ESTIMATED CONSUMER CREDIT LOSSES AND ARE PART OF THE MONITORING OF THE CREDIT RISK PROFILE OF THE PORTFOLIO. UNDER THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY, NEW SIGNIFICANT RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS, AS WELL AS MAJOR CHANGES TO SUCH MODELS, ARE REQUIRED TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. INTERNAL AUDIT ALSO PERIODICALLY TESTS THE INTERNAL CONTROLS AROUND THE MODELING PROCESS INCLUDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA UTILIZED. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP, SEE PAGE

153

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CONSUMER LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY AT AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO, INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY LEVEL WITH ESTABLISHED CONCENTRATION LIMITS THAT ARE REVIEWED AND REVISED, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT, TYPICALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. INDUSTRY AND COUNTERPARTY LIMITS, AS MEASURED IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE AND ECONOMIC CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, ARE SUBJECT TO STRESS-BASED LOSS CONSTRAINTS.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING.

•

LOAN UNDERWRITING AND CREDIT APPROVAL PROCESS

•

LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS

•

LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

•

USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS

•

COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES

IN ADDITION TO RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMS, AS WELL AS CONTINUOUS REVIEW, WHERE APPROPRIATE, OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FOR RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, A CREDIT REVIEW GROUP WITHIN INTERNAL AUDIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING THE CHANGING RISK GRADES ASSIGNED TO EXPOSURES; AND

•

EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUSINESS UNITS’ RISK-RATINGS, INCLUDING THE ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY OF RISK GRADES, THE TIMELINESS OF RISK GRADE CHANGES AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF RISK GRADES IN CREDIT MEMORANDA

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT QUALITY FORECASTS, CONCENTRATION LEVELS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS APPROPRIATE.

2013

CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT IN

2013

CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, WITH REDUCED CONCERNS AROUND THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL CRISIS AND IMPROVING MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS UNDERPERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS AND REDUCE SUCH EXPOSURES THROUGH REPAYMENTS, LOAN SALES AND WORKOUTS. THE FIRM SAW DECREASED DOWNGRADE, DEFAULT AND CHARGE-OFF ACTIVITY AND IMPROVED CONSUMER DELINQUENCY TRENDS. THE FIRM INCREASED ITS OVERALL LENDING ACTIVITY DRIVEN BY THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPARED WITH

2012

AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM’S REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND CONSUMER LOANS, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, CREDIT CARD LOANS, AUTO LOANS, BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, AND STUDENT LOANS. THE FIRM’S FOCUS IS ON SERVING THE PRIME SEGMENT OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON CONSUMER LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CONSUMER LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE IDENTIFIED AS PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (“PCI”) BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIOS, FICO RISK SCORES AND DELINQUENCY STATUS. THESE PCI LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS, AND THE POOLS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON PCI LOANS SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AS THE ECONOMY SLOWLY EXPANDS AND HOME PRICES IMPROVE. LOSS RATES ARE IMPROVING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CREDIT CARD AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS. EARLY-STAGE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DELINQUENCIES (30–89 DAYS DELINQUENT), EXCLUDING GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED LOANS, DECLINED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (150+ DAYS DELINQUENT) CONTINUED TO DECLINE BUT REMAIN ELEVATED. THE ELEVATED LEVEL OF THE LATE-STAGE DELINQUENT LOANS IS DUE, IN PART, TO LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN AND TO ELONGATED FORECLOSURE PROCESSING TIMELINES. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S STANDARD CHARGE-OFF PRACTICES, BUT SOME DELINQUENT LOANS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED UPON REMAIN IN THE MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS

CONSUMER LOAN BALANCES DECLINED DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW MORTGAGE AND AUTO ORIGINATIONS. CREDIT PERFORMANCE HAS IMPROVED ACROSS MOST PORTFOLIOS BUT RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENT LOANS REMAIN ELEVATED COMPARED WITH PRE-RECESSIONARY LEVELS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES. PCI LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXCLUDED FROM INDIVIDUAL LOAN PRODUCT DISCUSSIONS AND ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRM’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT DELINQUENCIES, LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

HOME EQUITY.

THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, WAS

$57.9 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$67.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE DECREASE IN THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOAN PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS. EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, FOR BOTH SENIOR AND JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS. LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES ALSO IMPROVED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, BUT CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED AS IMPROVEMENT IN THE NUMBER OF LOANS BECOMING SEVERELY DELINQUENT WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE CARRYING VALUE ON THESE LOANS, REFLECTING IMPROVING COLLATERAL VALUES. SENIOR LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WHILE JUNIOR LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS DECREASED IN 2013. NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR BOTH SENIOR AND JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN DELINQUENCIES AND HOME PRICES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF PRIOR YEAR INCREMENTAL CHARGE-OFFS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE ON CERTAIN LOANS DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY.

APPROXIMATELY

20%

OF THE FIRM’S HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LOANS (“HELOANS”) AND THE REMAINDER CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (“HELOCS”). HELOANS ARE GENERALLY FIXED-RATE, CLOSED-END, AMORTIZING LOANS, WITH TERMS RANGING FROM 3–30 YEARS. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE HELOANS ARE SENIOR LIENS AND THE REMAINDER ARE JUNIOR LIENS. IN GENERAL, HELOCS ORIGINATED BY THE FIRM ARE REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC RECASTS INTO A LOAN WITH A 20-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD. AT THE TIME OF ORIGINATION, THE BORROWER TYPICALLY SELECTS ONE OF TWO MINIMUM PAYMENT

OPTIONS THAT WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN EFFECT DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD: A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF 1% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE, OR INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS BASED ON A VARIABLE INDEX (TYPICALLY PRIME). HELOCS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL WERE GENERALLY REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC CONVERTS TO AN INTEREST-ONLY LOAN WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE END OF THE LOAN’S TERM.

THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF NON-PCI HELOCS OUTSTANDING WAS

$50 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOANS,

$30 BILLION

OF THE NON-PCI HELOCS OUTSTANDING ARE SCHEDULED TO RECAST AT WHICH TIME THE BORROWER MUST BEGIN TO MAKE FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS, OF WHICH,

$7 BILLION

,

$8 BILLION

AND

$7 BILLION

ARE SCHEDULED TO RECAST IN 2015, 2016 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, OF THE

$30 BILLION

IN NON-PCI HELOCS SCHEDULED TO RECAST, APPROXIMATELY

$14 BILLION

ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO RECAST, WITH THE REMAINING

$16 BILLION

REPRESENTING LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPECTED TO PREPAY (INCLUDING BORROWERS WHO APPEAR TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE BASED ON THE BORROWER’S LTV RATIO AND FICO SCORE) OR ARE LOANS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CHARGE-OFF. THE FIRM HAS CONSIDERED THIS PAYMENT RECAST RISK IN ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PAYMENT SHOCK (I.E., THE EXCESS OF THE FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT OVER THE INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT IN EFFECT PRIOR TO RECAST) EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT THE PAYMENT RECAST DATE, ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS. CERTAIN FACTORS, SUCH AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOME PRICES, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXPECTED AND/OR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THESE LOANS.

THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXHIBITING A MATERIAL DETERIORATION IN THEIR CREDIT RISK PROFILE OR WHEN THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOAN AMOUNT. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE BOTH THE NEAR-TERM AND LONGER-TERM REPRICING AND RECAST RISKS INHERENT IN ITS HELOC PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THAT THE FIRM’S ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE PORTFOLIO’S RISK PROFILE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE FIRM ESTIMATED THAT ITS HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION

OF CURRENT JUNIOR LIEN LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS A FIRST MORTGAGE LOAN THAT IS EITHER DELINQUENT OR HAS BEEN MODIFIED (“HIGH-RISK SECONDS”), COMPARED WITH

$3.1 BILLION

122

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. SUCH LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO POSE A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN THAT OF JUNIOR LIEN LOANS FOR WHICH THE SENIOR LIEN IS NEITHER DELINQUENT NOR MODIFIED. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE BALANCE OF ITS TOTAL EXPOSURE TO HIGH-RISK SECONDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING INTERNAL DATA AND LOAN LEVEL CREDIT BUREAU DATA (WHICH TYPICALLY PROVIDES THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF THE SENIOR LIEN). THE ESTIMATED BALANCE OF THESE HIGH-RISK SECONDS MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER FOR REASONS SUCH AS THE MOVEMENT OF RELATED SENIOR LIENS INTO AND OUT OF THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY BUCKET.

OF HIGH-RISK JUNIOR LIENS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE FIRM OWNS APPROXIMATELY

5%

AND SERVICES APPROXIMATELY

25%

OF THE RELATED SENIOR LIEN LOANS TO THE SAME BORROWERS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM’S JUNIOR LIEN LOANS IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIRM OWNS, SERVICES OR DOES NOT OWN OR SERVICE THE SENIOR LIEN. THE INCREASED PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE HIGHER-RISK JUNIOR LIEN LOANS WAS CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, INCLUDING PRIME, SUBPRIME AND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE

$94.9 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$84.5 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO INCREASED IN 2013 AS RETAINED PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS, WHICH REPRESENT LOANS WITH HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, WERE GREATER THAN PAYDOWNS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS. NET CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTING CONTINUED HOME PRICE IMPROVEMENT AND FAVORABLE DELINQUENCY TRENDS. DELINQUENCY LEVELS REMAIN ELEVATED COMPARED WITH PRE-RECESSIONARY LEVELS.

PRIME MORTGAGES, INCLUDING OPTION ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES (“ARMS”) AND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE

$87.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, COMPARED WITH

$76.3 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS INCREASED AS RETAINED ORIGINATIONS EXCEEDED PAYDOWNS, THE RUN-OFF OF OPTION ARM LOANS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS. EXCLUDING LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, BOTH EARLY-STAGE AND LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. NONACCRUAL LOANS DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR BUT REMAIN ELEVATED AS A RESULT OF ELONGATED FORECLOSURE PROCESSING TIMELINES. NET CHARGE-OFFS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN DELINQUENCIES AND HOME PRICES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM’S PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO INCLUDED

$14.3 BILLION

AND

$15.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED AND/OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, OF WHICH

$9.6 BILLION

AND

$11.8 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE, INCLUDING

$8.4 BILLION

AND

$10.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE. FOLLOWING THE FIRM’S SETTLEMENT REGARDING LOANS INSURED UNDER FEDERAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY FHA, HUD, AND VA, THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXPOSURE ON FUTURE CLAIM PAYMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT INSURED LOANS; HOWEVER, ANY FINANCIAL IMPACT RELATED TO EXPOSURE ON FUTURE CLAIMS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM’S PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO INCLUDED

$15.6 BILLION

AND

$16.0 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF INTEREST-ONLY LOANS, WHICH REPRESENTED

18%

AND

21%

OF THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LOANS HAVE AN INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT PERIOD GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE OR FIXED-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENT TO MATURITY AND ARE TYPICALLY ORIGINATED AS HIGHER-BALANCE LOANS TO HIGHER-INCOME BORROWERS. THE DECREASE IN THIS PORTFOLIO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS, AS BORROWERS ARE GENERALLY REFINANCING INTO LOWER RATE PRODUCTS. TO DATE, LOSSES ON THIS PORTFOLIO GENERALLY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE BROADER PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AND THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LOANS.

NON-PCI OPTION ARM LOANS ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, WERE

$5.6 BILLION

AND

$6.5 BILLION

AND REPRESENTED

6%

AND

9%

OF THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OPTION ARM LOANS RESULTED FROM PORTFOLIO RUNOFF. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, APPROXIMATELY

4%

OF OPTION ARM BORROWERS WERE DELINQUENT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BORROWERS WERE MAKING AMORTIZING PAYMENTS, ALTHOUGH SUCH PAYMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY FULLY AMORTIZING AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISK OF PAYMENT SHOCK DUE TO FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FOLLOWING BALANCES OF OPTION ARM LOANS WILL UNDERGO A PAYMENT RECAST THAT RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE.

$807 MILLION

IN

2014

,

$675 MILLION

IN

2015

AND

$164 MILLION

IN

2016

. AS THE FIRM’S OPTION ARM LOANS, OTHER THAN THOSE HELD IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO, ARE PRIMARILY LOANS WITH LOWER LTV RATIOS AND HIGHER BORROWER FICO SCORES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THESE BORROWERS WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO A LOWER RATE PRODUCT, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THIS PAYMENT RECAST RISK. TO DATE, LOSSES REALIZED ON OPTION ARM LOANS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE PAYMENT RECAST HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS.

ALTHOUGH HOME PRICES CONTINUE TO RECOVER, THE DECLINE IN HOME PRICES SINCE 2007 HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COLLATERAL VALUES UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN PORTFOLIO. IN GENERAL, THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS IS GREATER THAN THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS IN WHICH THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. WHILE A LARGE PORTION OF THE LOANS WITH CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS GREATER THAN 100% CONTINUE TO PAY AND ARE CURRENT, THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF THESE BORROWERS TO PAY REMAINS A RISK.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE FOR PCI LOANS PRESENTS THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS, AS WELL AS THE RATIOS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE. BECAUSE SUCH LOANS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE RATIOS OF THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE WILL BE LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES. THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES; AS SUCH, THE RESULTING RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

, COMPARED WITH

AND

, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. AVERAGE LTV RATIOS HAVE DECLINED CONSISTENT WITH RECENT IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES. ALTHOUGH HOME PRICES HAVE IMPROVED, HOME PRICES IN CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA ARE STILL LOWER THAN AT THE PEAK OF THE HOUSING MARKET; THIS CONTINUES TO NEGATIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LTV RATIOS AND THE RATIO OF NET CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE FOR LOANS IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO. OF THE TOTAL PCI PORTFOLIO,

26%

HAD A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%, AND

WHILE THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF PCI LOANS, THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON BORROWERS’ BEHAVIOR AND ONGOING ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON HOMES WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY, AS WELL AS ON THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE HOUSING.

LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES – RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

FOR BOTH THE FIRM’S ON–BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND LOANS SERVICED FOR OTHERS, MORE THAN

1.5 MILLION

MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO BORROWERS AND APPROXIMATELY

734,000

HAVE BEEN APPROVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2009. OF THESE, MORE THAN

725,000

HAVE ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION AS OF

DECEMBER 31,

2013

. OF THE REMAINING MODIFICATIONS OFFERED,

9%

ARE IN A TRIAL PERIOD OR STILL BEING REVIEWED FOR A MODIFICATION, WHILE

91%

HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE WERE DEEMED NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINAL MODIFICATION.

THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURY’S MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (“MHA”) PROGRAMS AND IS CONTINUING TO OFFER ITS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS TO FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE U.S. TREASURY’S PROGRAMS. THE MHA PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“HAMP”) AND THE SECOND LIEN MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“2MP”). THE FIRM’S OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS FOR TROUBLED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HAMP INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL MODIFICATION PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE GSES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE CONCESSIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OFFERED UNDER HAMP AND 2MP BUT WITH EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS OFFERED SPECIFIC TARGETED MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO HIGHER RISK BORROWERS, MANY OF WHOM WERE CURRENT ON THEIR MORTGAGES PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW LOANS ARE MODIFIED, SEE NOTE 14, LOAN MODIFICATIONS, ON PAGES

268–273

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS UNDER HAMP AND UNDER ONE OF THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE LARGELY MODELED AFTER HAMP, REQUIRE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE UNDER THE NEW TERMS DURING A TRIAL MODIFICATION PERIOD, AND MUST BE SUCCESSFULLY RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE THE LOAN CAN BE PERMANENTLY MODIFIED. IN THE CASE OF SPECIFIC TARGETED MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, RE-UNDERWRITING THE LOAN OR A TRIAL MODIFICATION PERIOD IS GENERALLY NOT REQUIRED, UNLESS THE TARGETED LOAN IS

126

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

DELINQUENT AT THE TIME OF MODIFICATION. WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION.

THE PRIMARY INDICATOR USED BY MANAGEMENT TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MODIFIED LOANS REDEFAULT. MODIFICATION REDEFAULT RATES ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF LOAN MODIFIED, THE BORROWER’S OVERALL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY THE MODIFIED LOAN AND MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. REDUCTION IN PAYMENT SIZE FOR A BORROWER HAS SHOWN TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVER IN IMPROVING REDEFAULT RATES.

THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFIED LOANS GENERALLY DIFFERS BY PRODUCT TYPE AND ALSO ON WHETHER THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO, DUE BOTH TO DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT QUALITY AND IN THE TYPES OF MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS, THAT HAVE BEEN SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

20%

FOR SENIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY,

20%

FOR JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY,

15%

FOR PRIME MORTGAGES INCLUDING OPTION ARMS, AND

26%

FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. THE CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

20%

FOR HOME EQUITY,

16%

FOR PRIME MORTGAGES,

14%

FOR OPTION ARMS AND

29%

FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. THE FAVORABLE PERFORMANCE OF THE PCI OPTION ARM MODIFICATIONS IS THE RESULT OF A TARGETED PROACTIVE PROGRAM WHICH FIXES THE BORROWER’S PAYMENT AT THE CURRENT LEVEL. THE CUMULATIVE REDEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFICATIONS COMPLETED UNDER BOTH HAMP AND THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FROM OCTOBER 1, 2009, THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2013.

CERTAIN LOANS THAT WERE MODIFIED UNDER HAMP AND THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY THE FIRM’S MODIFICATION PROGRAM THAT WAS MODELED AFTER HAMP) HAVE INTEREST RATE RESET PROVISIONS (“STEP-RATE MODIFICATIONS”). BEGINNING IN 2014, INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS WILL GENERALLY INCREASE BY 1% PER YEAR UNTIL THE RATE REACHES A SPECIFIED CAP, TYPICALLY AT A PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATE FOR A FIXED-RATE LOAN AS OF THE MODIFICATION DATE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF NON-PCI LOANS MODIFIED IN STEP-RATE MODIFICATIONS WAS $5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WITH $1 BILLION AND $2 BILLION SCHEDULED TO EXPERIENCE THE INITIAL INTEREST RATE INCREASE IN 2015 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF PCI LOANS MODIFIED IN STEP-RATE MODIFICATIONS WAS $11 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WITH $2 BILLION AND $3 BILLION SCHEDULED TO EXPERIENCE THE INITIAL INTEREST RATE INCREASE IN 2015 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF THESE POTENTIAL INTEREST RATE INCREASES IS APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS RISK EXPOSURE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INFORMATION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RELATING TO MODIFIED ON–BALANCE SHEET RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS FOR WHICH CONCESSIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. MODIFICATIONS OF PCI LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS PCI LOANS, AND THE IMPACT OF THE MODIFICATION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. MODIFICATIONS OF CONSUMER LOANS OTHER THAN PCI LOANS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (“TDRS”). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON TDRS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE WHOLESALE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT REMAINED FAVORABLE THROUGHOUT

2013

DRIVING AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL CLIENT ACTIVITY. DISCIPLINE IN UNDERWRITING ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING CONTINUES TO REMAIN A KEY POINT OF FOCUS, CONSISTENT WITH EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, IN PART BY CONDUCTING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH REVIEWS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND OF INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS. DURING THE YEAR, WHOLESALE

CRITICIZED ASSETS AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS DECREASED FROM HIGHER LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN

2012

, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN NONACCRUAL LOANS BY

39%.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE (PRIMARILY CIB, CB AND AM) INCREASED BY

$13.7 BILLION

FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF

$11.4 BILLION

IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND

$8.4 BILLION

IN LOANS REFLECTING INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IN CB AND AM. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

$9.2 BILLION

DECREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AND REDUCTIONS IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVES DUE TO MARKET MOVEMENTS. THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EQUITY DERIVATIVES DRIVEN BY A RISE IN EQUITY MARKETS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE AND CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ON THE PREVIOUS PAGES.

•

REAL ESTATE: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY INCREASED BY

$10.9 BILLION

OR

14%

, IN

2013

TO

$87.1 BILLION

. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN MULTIFAMILY EXPOSURE IN THE CB. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THIS INDUSTRY IMPROVED AS THE INVESTMENT-GRADE PORTION OF THE EXPOSURES TO THIS INDUSTRY INCREASED BY

26%

FROM

2012

. THE RATIO OF NONACCRUAL RETAINED LOANS TO TOTAL RETAINED LOANS DECREASED TO

0.50%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 FROM

0.86%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

•

STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.

EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR DECREASED BY

$6.2 BILLION

IN

2013

TO

$35.7 BILLION

. LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY

66%

OF THE EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR, GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF LIQUIDITY AND STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITIES BACKING BONDS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO REMAINS HIGH AS

97%

OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE, UNCHANGED FROM

2012

. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MONITOR THIS EXPOSURE IN LIGHT OF THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FACED BY CERTAIN STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF COMMITMENTS FOR BOND LIQUIDITY AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES

318–324

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESS, THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON LOANS, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE. ONE WAY OF MANAGING CREDIT RISK IS THROUGH SECONDARY MARKET SALES OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. DURING

2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM SOLD

$16.3 BILLION

AND

$8.4 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY REPRESENT MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE CLIENTS THAT ARE COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF ASSETS MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS’ BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A MAINTENANCE MARGIN CALL IS MADE TO THE CLIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT, THE CLIENT’S POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED BY THE FIRM TO MEET THE MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMITMENTS (INCLUDING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES) AND GUARANTEES, TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN ON THESE COMMITMENTS OR THE FIRM FULFILLS ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, AND THE COUNTERPARTIES SUBSEQUENTLY FAILS TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS.

IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRM’S ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A “LOAN-EQUIVALENT” AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED ON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME DRAWN UPON IN AN EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRM’S LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS

$218.9 BILLION

AND

$223.7 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

CLEARING SERVICES

THE FIRM PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES FOR CLIENTS ENTERING INTO SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH THE PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN LOSSES INCURRED BY CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (“CCPS”). WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS CREDIT RISK TO ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF ADEQUATE MARGIN AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND CAN ALSO CEASE PROVISION OF CLEARING SERVICES IF CLIENTS DO NOT ADHERE TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEARING AGREEMENT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CLEARING SERVICES, SEE NOTE 29 ON

318–324

, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. DERIVATIVES ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT EXPOSURE. THE NATURE OF THE COUNTERPARTY AND THE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM OF THE DERIVATIVE AFFECT THE CREDIT RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) DERIVATIVES THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. FOR EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVES (“ETD”) SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AND “CLEARED” OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC-CLEARED”) DERIVATIVES, THE FIRM IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE RELEVANT CCP. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES ARISING ON DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE USE OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, COUNTERPARTIES AND SETTLEMENT TYPES, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WERE

$65.8 BILLION

AND

$75.0 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENT’S VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK SHOULD ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ADDITIONAL LIQUID SECURITIES (PRIMARILY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES AND OTHER G7 GOVERNMENT BONDS) AND OTHER CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AGGREGATING

$14.4 BILLION

AND

$15.2 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY, THAT MAY BE USED AS SECURITY WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CLIENT’S EXPOSURE IS IN THE FIRM’S FAVOR.

IN ADDITION TO THE COLLATERAL DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL (PRIMARILY: CASH; G7 GOVERNMENT SECURITIES; OTHER LIQUID GOVERNMENT-AGENCY AND GUARANTEED SECURITIES; AND CORPORATE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES) DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY AND COLLATERAL THAT THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THOUGH THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE BALANCES AND IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CLIENT’S DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRM’S FAVOR. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM HELD

$29.0 BILLION

, OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES FAIR VALUE, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (“DRE”), AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE (“AVG”). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A

97.5%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. DRE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CVA, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. THE THREE YEAR AVG EXPOSURE WAS

$35.4 BILLION

AND

$42.3 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF

$51.3 BILLION

AND

$59.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRM’S AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF WRONG-WAY RISK, WHICH IS BROADLY DEFINED AS THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY (AVG) AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT QUALITY. MANY FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE CORRELATIONS OVER TIME. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE CORRELATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE FIRM MAY ADJUST THE CVA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY’S AVG. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE ACCOMPANYING GRAPH SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE DRE AND AVG METRICS. THE TWO MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW THAT EXPOSURE WILL DECLINE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES ARE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER; AND SECOND, AS AN END-USER, TO MANAGE THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS EXPOSURES.

FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

INCLUDED IN END-USER ACTIVITIES ARE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (COLLECTIVELY, “CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT” ACTIVITIES). INFORMATION ON CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IS PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ALSO USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS AN END-USER TO MANAGE OTHER EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM CERTAIN AFS SECURITIES AND FROM CERTAIN SECURITIES HELD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES; FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN THE FIRM’S CAPACITY AS A MARKET MAKER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER U.S. GAAP; THESE DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. IN CONTRAST, THE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BEING RISK-MANAGED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. THIS ASYMMETRY IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, BETWEEN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, CAUSES EARNINGS VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (“CDS”) PROTECTION AS A HEDGE OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES MAY VARY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITY (I.E., THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE LOSSES ON SPECIFIC EXPOSURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE PURCHASED CDS), AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE CDS (WHICH MAY HAVE A DEFINED CREDIT EVENT THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH AN ACTUAL LOSS REALIZED BY THE FIRM) AND THE MATURITY OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION (WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE SHORTER THAN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES). HOWEVER, THE FIRM GENERALLY SEEKS TO PURCHASE CREDIT PROTECTION WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS THE SAME OR SIMILAR TO THE MATURITY DATE OF THE EXPOSURE FOR WHICH THE PROTECTION WAS PURCHASED, AND REMAINING DIFFERENCES IN MATURITY ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO HEDGES

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS OUT THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THE FIRM’S CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THE CVA (WHICH REFLECTS THE CREDIT QUALITY OF DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE), AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER HEDGES USED IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT OF CVA. THESE RESULTS CAN VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SPECIFIC POSITIONS IN THE PORTFOLIO.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM, AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$17.0 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, A DECREASE OF

$5.6 BILLION

FROM

$22.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE DECREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS DUE TO A

$5.5 BILLION

REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ALLOWANCE REFLECTING LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES DUE TO THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED HOME PRICES ON THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AND IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS, AND THE RISK ATTRIBUTES OF CERTAIN LOANS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO (E.G., LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS, JUNIOR LIEN LOANS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO A DELINQUENT OR MODIFIED SENIOR LIEN, HELOCS WITH FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST) CONTINUED TO CONTRIBUTE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO; THESE UNCERTAINTIES WERE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED

$3.8 BILLION

FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, OF WHICH $2.3 BILLION WAS FROM THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO NON CREDIT-IMPAIRED ALLOWANCE AND $1.6 BILLION FROM THE PCI ALLOWANCE. THE DECREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED HOME PRICES AS WELL AS IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT DELINQUENCIES AND NONACCRUAL LOANS IN THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOAN PORTFOLIO, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

120–129

AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED BY

$1.7 BILLION

FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE DECREASE INCLUDED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH THE ASSET-SPECIFIC AND FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE. THE REDUCTION IN THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, WHICH RELATES TO LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TDRS, LARGELY REFLECTS THE CHANGING PROFILE OF THE TDR PORTFOLIO. THE VOLUME OF NEW TDRS, WHICH HAVE HIGHER LOSS RATES DUE TO EXPECTED REDEFAULTS, CONTINUES TO DECREASE, AND THE LOSS RATE ON EXISTING TDRS IS ALSO DECREASING OVER TIME AS PREVIOUSLY RESTRUCTURED LOANS CONTINUE TO PERFORM. THE REDUCTION IN THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUING TREND OF IMPROVING DELINQUENCIES AND A REDUCTION IN BANKRUPTCIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT DELINQUENCIES IN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

120–129

AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE WAS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED REFLECTING A FAVORABLE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND STABLE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS FOR BOTH THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS

$705 MILLION

AND

$668 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, AND

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EQUITY PRICES, COMMODITY PRICES, IMPLIED VOLATILITIES OR CREDIT SPREADS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING TREASURY AND CIO WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND TO DEFINE MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE MARKET RISK FUNCTION REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

MARKET RISK SEEKS TO CONTROL RISK, FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK PROFILE FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

ESTABLISHMENT OF A MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF LINE OF BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE MARKET RISK

•

DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS

•

PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MARKET RISKS WITHIN ITS UNITS. THE INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS CHARGED WITH ENSURING THAT ALL MATERIAL MARKET RISKS ARE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED AND MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK SET OUT BY MARKET RISK.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.

•

VAR

•

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

•

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

•

LOSS ADVISORIES

•

PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

•

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (“RIFLES”)

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES VAR, A STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN A NORMAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE DAY-TO-DAY RISK DECISIONS MADE BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

THE FIRM HAS ONE OVERARCHING VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK, RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES ACROSS THE FIRM, WHICH UTILIZES HISTORICAL SIMULATION BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THE FRAMEWORK’S APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE USE OF RISK MANAGEMENT VAR PROVIDES A STABLE MEASURE OF VAR THAT CLOSELY ALIGNS TO THE DAY-TO-DAY RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND PROVIDES NECESSARY/APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO RISK EVENTS ON A DAILY BASIS.

RISK MANAGEMENT VAR IS CALCULATED ASSUMING A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY WHICH APPROXIMATES A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THAT, ASSUMING CURRENT CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL CHANGES USED IN THE SIMULATION, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR VAR “BAND BREAKS,” DEFINED AS LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES, NOT MORE THAN FIVE TIMES EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS. THE NUMBER OF VAR BAND BREAKS OBSERVED CAN DIFFER FROM THE STATISTICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER OF BAND BREAKS IF THE CURRENT LEVEL OF MARKET VOLATILITY IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE LEVEL OF MARKET VOLATILITY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS OF HISTORICAL DATA USED IN THE VAR CALCULATION.

UNDERLYING THE OVERALL VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK ARE INDIVIDUAL VAR MODELS THAT SIMULATE HISTORICAL MARKET RETURNS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND/OR RISK FACTORS. TO CAPTURE MATERIAL MARKET RISKS AS PART OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, COMPREHENSIVE VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE PERFORMED DAILY FOR BUSINESSES WHOSE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO MARKET RISK. THESE VAR MODELS ARE GRANULAR AND INCORPORATE NUMEROUS RISK FACTORS AND INPUTS TO SIMULATE DAILY CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OVER THE HISTORICAL PERIOD; INPUTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF EACH PORTFOLIO AS SENSITIVITIES AND HISTORICAL TIME SERIES USED TO GENERATE DAILY MARKET VALUES MAY BE DIFFERENT ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES OR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE VAR MODEL RESULTS ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIOS ARE AGGREGATED AT THE FIRM LEVEL.

DATA SOURCES USED IN VAR MODELS MAY BE THE SAME AS THOSE USED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT VALUATIONS. HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE MARKET PRICES ARE NOT OBSERVABLE, OR WHERE PROXIES ARE USED IN VAR HISTORICAL TIME SERIES, THE SOURCES MAY DIFFER. IN ADDITION, THE DAILY MARKET DATA USED IN VAR MODELS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTED FOR VCG PRICE TESTING IN THEIR MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS (SEE PAGES

196–200

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS.) VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS REQUIRE MORE TIMELY (I.E., DAILY) DATA AND A CONSISTENT SOURCE FOR VALUATION AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT

PRACTICAL TO USE THE DATA COLLECTED IN THE VCG MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS.

VAR PROVIDES A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND IS USED FOR AGGREGATING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES AND MONITORING LIMITS. THESE VAR RESULTS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

SINCE VAR IS BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, IT IS AN IMPERFECT MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL LOSSES, AND IT IS NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF STRESSED MARKET CONDITIONS OR TO MANAGE ANY IMPACT FROM POTENTIAL STRESS EVENTS. IN ADDITION, BASED ON THEIR RELIANCE ON AVAILABLE HISTORICAL DATA, LIMITED TIME HORIZONS, AND OTHER FACTORS, VAR MEASURES ARE INHERENTLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO MEASURE CERTAIN RISKS AND TO PREDICT LOSSES, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET ILLIQUIDITY AND SUDDEN OR SEVERE SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AS VAR CANNOT BE USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE LOSSES IN THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK POSITIONS, THE FIRM CONSIDERS OTHER METRICS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW, TO CAPTURE AND MANAGE ITS MARKET RISK POSITIONS UNDER STRESSED SCENARIOS.

FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SPECIFIC RISK PARAMETERS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN VAR DUE TO THE LACK OF INHERENT LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HISTORICAL DATA. THE FIRM USES PROXIES TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHEN DAILY TIME SERIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS LIKELY THAT USING AN ACTUAL PRICE-BASED TIME SERIES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD AFFECT THE VAR RESULTS PRESENTED. THE FIRM USES ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO CAPTURE AND MEASURE THOSE RISK PARAMETERS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE CAPTURED IN VAR, INCLUDING ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING, NONSTATISTICAL MEASURES AND RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

THE FIRM’S VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATED AND ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIRM’S MODELING TECHNIQUES AND OTHER FACTORS. SUCH CHANGES WILL ALSO AFFECT HISTORICAL COMPARISONS OF VAR RESULTS. MODEL CHANGES GO THROUGH A REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE MODEL RISK ON PAGE

153

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SEPARATELY, THE FIRM CALCULATES A DAILY AGGREGATED VAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY RULES (“REGULATORY VAR”), WHICH IS USED TO DERIVE THE FIRM’S REGULATORY VAR-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BASEL 2.5 MARKET RISK RULE (“BASEL 2.5”). THIS REGULATORY VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY ASSUMES A TEN BUSINESS-DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL LOSS METHODOLOGY WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. REGULATORY VAR IS APPLIED TO “COVERED” POSITIONS AS DEFINED BY BASEL 2.5, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES OF ACCRUAL LOANS

144

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, WHILE REGULATORY VAR EXCLUDES THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES.

(A)

ON JULY 2, 2012, CIO TRANSFERRED ITS SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, OTHER THAN A PORTION AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY $12 BILLION NOTIONAL, TO CIB; CIO’S RETAINED PORTFOLIO WAS EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012.

(B)

AVERAGE PORTFOLIO VAR AND PERIOD-END PORTFOLIO VAR WERE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VAR OF THE COMPONENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH IS DUE TO PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT RISKS ARE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED.

(C)

DESIGNATED AS NOT MEANINGFUL (“NM”), BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DISTINCT RISK COMPONENTS, AND HENCE IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A PORTFOLIO-DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT.

(D)

THE FIRM RESTATED ITS 2012 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REGARDING THE CIO SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE CIO VAR AMOUNTS FOR 2012 WERE NOT RECALCULATED TO REFLECT THE RESTATEMENT.

(E)

EFFECTIVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, CIB’S VAR INCLUDES THE VAR OF THE FORMER REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INVESTMENT BANK AND TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES (“TSS”), WHICH WERE COMBINED TO FORM THE CIB BUSINESS SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REORGANIZATION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. TSS VAR WAS NOT MATERIAL AND WAS PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER VAR. PRIOR PERIOD VAR DISCLOSURES WERE NOT REVISED AS A RESULT OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT REORGANIZATION.

(F)

THE TREASURY AND CIO VAR INCLUDES TREASURY VAR AS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013.

(G)

THE MINIMUM ASSET MANAGEMENT VAR FOR 2012 WAS IMMATERIAL.

AS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AVERAGE TOTAL VAR AND AVERAGE CIB VAR DECREASED DURING 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REDUCED RISK IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012, THE FIRM APPLIED A NEW VAR MODEL TO CALCULATE VAR FOR CIO’S SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO THAT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CIB ON JULY 2, 2012. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY AMONG LIKE PRODUCTS WITHIN CIB AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BASEL 2.5 REQUIREMENTS, THE FIRM MOVED CIO’S SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO AN EXISTING VAR MODEL WITHIN THE CIB. THIS CHANGE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE AVERAGE FIXED INCOME VAR AND AVERAGE TOTAL CIB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR, AND IT HAD NO IMPACT TO THE AVERAGE TOTAL VAR COMPARED WITH THE MODEL USED IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2012.

AVERAGE TREASURY AND CIO VAR FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, DECREASED FROM 2012, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE REDUCTION IN AND TRANSFER OF RISK FROM CIO’S SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO THE CIB ON JULY 2, 2012. THE INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS RETAINED BY CIO WERE EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012.

AVERAGE MORTGAGE BANKING VAR FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, DECREASED FROM 2012. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED RISK ACROSS THE MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING BUSINESSES.

THE FIRM’S AVERAGE TOTAL VAR DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT WAS $9 MILLION OR 15% OF THE SUM FOR 2013, COMPARED WITH $45 MILLION OR 23% OF THE SUM FOR 2012. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VAR BACK-TESTING

THE FIRM EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS VAR METHODOLOGY BY BACK-TESTING, WHICH COMPARES THE DAILY RISK MANAGEMENT VAR RESULTS WITH THE DAILY GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON MARKET-RISK RELATED REVENUE.

EFFECTIVE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM REVISED ITS DEFINITION OF MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION USED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS UNDER BASEL 2.5. UNDER THIS DEFINITION MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DEFINED AS: PROFITS AND LOSSES ON THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT POSITIONS,

EXCLUDING

FEES, COMMISSIONS, FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, NET INTEREST INCOME, AND GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM INTRADAY TRADING.

THE FOLLOWING CHART COMPARES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT POSITIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, UNDER THE REVISED DEFINITION. AS THE CHART PRESENTS MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THOSE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, THE RESULTS IN THE TABLE BELOW DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS OF BACKTESTING DISCLOSED IN THE FIRM’S BASEL 2.5 REPORT, WHICH ARE BASED ON REGULATORY VAR. THE CHART SHOWS THAT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FIRM OBSERVED TWO VAR BAND BREAKS AND POSTED GAINS ON 177 OF THE 260 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD.

PRIOR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM DISCLOSED A HISTOGRAM WHICH PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF DAILY BACKTESTING AGAINST ITS DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR CALCULATION. UNDER THIS PREVIOUS PRESENTATION, THE MARKET RISK RELATED REVENUE WAS DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF: PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR CIB, AND TREASURY AND CIO; TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME FOR CIB, TREASURY AND CIO, AND MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING IN CCB; CIB BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR

OTHER REVENUE; REVENUE FROM SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE; MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME FOR THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS, AND ALL RELATED HEDGES; AND MARKET-RISK RELATED REVENUE FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT HEDGES; GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DVA WERE EXCLUDED. UNDER THIS PRIOR MEASURE THERE WERE NO VAR BAND BREAKS NOR ANY TRADING LOSS DAYS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

OTHER RISK MEASURES

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKETS USING RECENT HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR AS AN INDICATOR OF LOSSES, STRESS TESTING IS INTENDED TO CAPTURE THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM RUNS WEEKLY STRESS TESTS ON MARKET-RELATED RISKS ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS SUCH AS CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES OR COMMODITY PRICES. THE FRAMEWORK USES A GRID-BASED APPROACH, WHICH CALCULATES MULTIPLE MAGNITUDES OF STRESS FOR BOTH MARKET RALLIES AND MARKET SELL-OFFS FOR EACH RISK FACTOR. STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RISK POSITIONS ARE REPORTED TO THE FIRM’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY OF POSITIONS TO CERTAIN DEFINED EVENTS AND TO ENABLE THEM TO MANAGE THEIR RISKS WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY.

STRESS SCENARIOS ARE DEFINED AND REVIEWED BY MARKET RISK, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE REVIEWED BY THE RELEVANT RISK COMMITTEES. WHILE MOST OF THE SCENARIOS ESTIMATE LOSSES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET MOVES, SUCH AS AN EQUITY MARKET COLLAPSE OR CREDIT CRISIS, THE FIRM ALSO DEVELOPS SCENARIOS TO QUANTIFY RISK ARISING FROM SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OR CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS, WHICH ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE CERTAIN IDIOSYNCRATIC MARKET MOVEMENTS. SCENARIOS MAY BE REDEFINED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. AD HOC SCENARIOS ARE RUN IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM’S STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK IS UTILIZED IN CALCULATING RESULTS UNDER SCENARIOS MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S CCAR AND ICAAP (“INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS”) PROCESSES.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES INCLUDE SENSITIVITIES TO VARIABLES USED TO VALUE POSITIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES, INTEREST RATE BASIS POINT VALUES AND MARKET VALUES. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY LINE-OF-BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR TACTICAL CONTROL AND MONITORING LIMITS.

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS OF RISK TOLERANCE. PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE DEFINED AS THE DECLINE IN NET PROFIT AND LOSS SINCE THE YEAR-TO-DATE PEAK REVENUE LEVEL.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS CONSIDER POTENTIAL MATERIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN TAX LEGISLATION, OR A PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF UNUSUAL MARKET MOVES. THIS INFORMATION ALLOWS THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT AS INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FIRM’S SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISKS. INTEREST RATE RISK ARISES NOT ONLY FROM TRADING ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO FROM THE FIRM’S TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, WHICH INCLUDE EXTENSION OF LOANS AND CREDIT FACILITIES, TAKING DEPOSITS AND ISSUING DEBT. THE CIO, TREASURY AND CORPORATE (“CTC”) RISK COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES THE FIRM’S STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK POLICIES AND MARKET RISK LIMITS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CIO, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, CALCULATES THE FIRM’S STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE AND REVIEWS IT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE AND THE FIRM’S ALCO.

STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK CAN OCCUR DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE (FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE).

•

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED, CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR REPRICING, AND ANY INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

OVERSIGHT OF STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK IS MANAGED THROUGH A DEDICATED RISK FUNCTION REPORTING TO THE CTC CRO. THIS RISK FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREATING GOVERNANCE OVER ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTABLISHING AND MONITORING LIMITS FOR STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK.

THE FIRM MANAGES STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK GENERALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND RELATED DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH EARNINGS-AT-RISK, WHICH MEASURES THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE FIRM’S CORE NET INTEREST INCOME (SEE PAGE

83

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CORE NET INTEREST INCOME) AND INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FEES. EARNINGS-AT-RISK EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF TRADING ACTIVITIES AND MSR, AS THESE SENSITIVITIES ARE CAPTURED UNDER VAR.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK SCENARIOS ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THIS REVENUE, AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE FIRM’S PRETAX CORE NET INTEREST INCOME, OVER THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS, UTILIZING MULTIPLE ASSUMPTIONS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE SCENARIOS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRICING SENSITIVITIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE SCENARIOS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR. MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES COMPARED WITH UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL RATES, THE TIME SINCE ORIGINATION, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

THE CHANGE IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK FROM DECEMBER 31, 2012, RESULTED FROM HIGHER EXPECTED DEPOSIT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPOSITIONING THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM’S BENEFIT TO RISING RATES IS LARGELY A RESULT OF REINVESTING AT HIGHER YIELDS AND ASSETS RE-PRICING AT A FASTER PACE THAN DEPOSITS.

ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER INTEREST RATE SCENARIO USED BY THE FIRM — INVOLVING A STEEPER YIELD CURVE WITH LONG-TERM RATES RISING BY 100 BASIS POINTS AND SHORT-TERM RATES STAYING AT CURRENT LEVELS — RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH PRETAX CORE NET INTEREST INCOME BENEFIT OF $407 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN CORE NET INTEREST INCOME UNDER THIS SCENARIO REFLECTS THE FIRM REINVESTING AT THE HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES, WITH FUNDING COSTS REMAINING UNCHANGED.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS SET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY AND ACCOMMODATION OF CLIENT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE. THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE OF BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS. LIMITS MAY ALSO BE ALLOCATED WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL.

LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED BY MARKET RISK IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY MARKET RISK AND UPDATED AS APPROPRIATE, WITH ANY CHANGES APPROVED BY LINES OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING CERTAIN OF THESE RISK LIMITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. ALL LIMITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS BY MARKET RISK ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED.

LIMIT BREACHES ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER BY RISK MANAGEMENT TO LIMIT APPROVERS, MARKET RISK AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH, MARKET RISK CONSULTS WITH FIRM SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND LINES OF BUSINESS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION REQUIRED TO RETURN TO COMPLIANCE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A REDUCTION IN RISK IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE EXCESS. ANY FIRM OR LINE OF BUSINESS-LEVEL LIMITS THAT ARE IN EXCESS FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS OR LONGER, OR THAT ARE OVER LIMIT BY MORE THAN 30%, ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

COUNTRY RISK IS THE RISK THAT A SOVEREIGN EVENT OR ACTION ALTERS THE VALUE OR TERMS OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF OBLIGORS, COUNTERPARTIES AND ISSUERS, OR ADVERSELY IMPACTS MARKETS RELATED TO A COUNTRY. THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS, DETERMINING RISK TOLERANCE, AND MEASURING AND MONITORING DIRECT COUNTRY EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICY FOR MANAGING COUNTRY RISK IN BOTH EMERGING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ACTIVELY MONITORS THE VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS GIVING RISE TO COUNTRY RISK TO ENSURE THE FIRM’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURES ARE DIVERSIFIED AND THAT EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE FIRM’S STRATEGY AND RISK TOLERANCE RELATIVE TO A COUNTRY.

COUNTRY RISK ORGANIZATION

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WHICH WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER RISK FUNCTIONS TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR COUNTRY RISK WITHIN THE FIRM. THE FIRMWIDE RISK EXECUTIVE FOR COUNTRY RISK REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK FRAMEWORK

•

ASSIGNING SOVEREIGN RATINGS AND ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS

•

MEASURING AND MONITORING COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE AND STRESS ACROSS THE FIRM

•

MANAGING COUNTRY LIMITS AND REPORTING TRENDS AND LIMIT BREACHES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT

•

DEVELOPING SURVEILLANCE TOOLS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS

•

PROVIDING COUNTRY RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS

COUNTRY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO COUNTRY RISK THROUGH ITS LENDING, INVESTING, AND MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. COUNTRY EXPOSURE INCLUDES ACTIVITY WITH BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY. UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, COUNTRY EXPOSURE IS REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED OR WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUE IS DERIVED, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE DOMICILE (LEGAL RESIDENCE) OR COUNTRY OF INCORPORATION OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR. COUNTRY EXPOSURES ARE GENERALLY MEASURED BY CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S RISK TO AN IMMEDIATE DEFAULT OF THE COUNTERPARTY OR OBLIGOR, WITH ZERO RECOVERY. ASSUMPTIONS ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE MEASUREMENT AND ALLOCATION OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN TRANCHED CREDIT DERIVATIVES. DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT APPROACHES OR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF REPORTED COUNTRY EXPOSURE.

UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK.

•

LENDING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THE TOTAL COMMITTED AMOUNT (FUNDED AND UNFUNDED), NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES COLLATERAL RECEIVED

•

SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR RECEIVABLE BALANCE, NET OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED

•

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL POSITIONS, INCLUDING BOTH LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS

•

COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, IS MEASURED AT THE DERIVATIVE’S FAIR VALUE, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IS REPORTED BASED ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY AND IS MEASURED AT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED OR SOLD, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IS PRESENTED ON A NET BASIS, AS SUCH ACTIVITIES OFTEN RESULT IN SELLING AND PURCHASING PROTECTION RELATED TO THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY; THIS REFLECTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES THESE EXPOSURES

THE FIRM ALSO HAS INDIRECT EXPOSURES TO COUNTRY RISK (FOR EXAMPLE, RELATED TO THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED ON SECURITIES FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR RELATED TO CLIENT CLEARING ACTIVITIES). THESE INDIRECT EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE FIRM’S CREDIT, MARKET, AND OPERATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE, RATHER THAN THROUGH COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK REPORTING DIFFERS FROM THE REPORTING PROVIDED UNDER FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REPORTING METHODOLOGY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FFIEC’S REPORTING METHODOLOGY, SEE CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS ON PAGE

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

COUNTRY RISK STRESS TESTING

THE COUNTRY RISK STRESS FRAMEWORK AIMS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM A COUNTRY CRISIS BY CAPTURING THE IMPACT OF LARGE ASSET PRICE MOVEMENTS IN A COUNTRY BASED ON MARKET SHOCKS COMBINED WITH COUNTERPARTY SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY DEFINES AND RUNS AD HOC STRESS SCENARIOS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE CONCERNS.

COUNTRY RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES FOR SOVEREIGN RATINGS REVIEWS AND LIMIT MANAGEMENT. COUNTRY STRESS AND NOMINAL EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED UNDER A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY LIMIT FRAMEWORK. COUNTRY RATINGS AND LIMITS ACTIVITY ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND REPORTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. COUNTRY LIMIT REQUIREMENTS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS OFTEN AS NECESSARY, BUT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP USES SURVEILLANCE TOOLS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS, SUCH AS SIGNALING MODELS AND RATINGS INDICATORS.

COUNTRY RISK REPORTING

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRM’S TOP 20 EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY (EXCLUDING THE U.S.). THE SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRM’S LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY, BASED ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FIRM’S VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL SITUATION IN EUROPE SHOWING SIGNS OF STABILIZATION, WITH SPAIN AND IRELAND EXITING THEIR BAIL OUT PROGRAMS AND SOME ENCOURAGING PROGRESS ON FINANCIAL REFORM, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR ITS EXPOSURES IN SPAIN, ITALY, IRELAND, PORTUGAL AND GREECE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE FIVE COUNTRIES IS MODEST RELATIVE TO THE FIRM’S AGGREGATE EXPOSURES. THE F

IRM CONTINUES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AND SUPPORT CLIENT ACTIVITY IN THESE COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, THE FIRM’S AGGREGATE NET EXPOSURES AND SECTOR DISTRIBUTION MAY VARY OVER TIME.

UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS OF THE REFERENCE ENTITY ARE LOCATED. EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED ASSUMING THAT ALL OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ZERO RECOVERY. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGLE-NAME AND INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE MEASURED AT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE. EXPOSURES FOR INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SEVERAL UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES, ARE DETERMINED BY EVALUATING THE RELEVANT COUNTRY FOR EACH OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES UNDERLYING THE NAMED INDEX, AND ALLOCATING THE APPLICABLE AMOUNT OF THE NOTIONAL AND FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE TO EACH OF THE RELEVANT COUNTRIES. TRANCHED CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE MEASURED AT THE MODELED CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ASSUMING THE SIMULTANEOUS DEFAULT OF ALL UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY; THIS APPROACH CONSIDERS THE TRANCHED NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE (I.E., THAT SOME TRANCHES ARE SUBORDINATE TO OTHERS) AND THE FIRM’S OWN POSITION IN THE STRUCTURE.

THE “TOTAL” LINE IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE SIMPLE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY OR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD PRODUCE DIFFERENT RESULTS.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES REFLECTED IN THE “PORTFOLIO HEDGING” COLUMN ARE PREDOMINANTLY SINGLE-NAME CDS USED IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY

EXPOSURE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION AS A HEDGE OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MATURITY OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION, THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITY, AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE CDS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ON PAGES

, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM’S NET PRESENTATION OF PURCHASED AND SOLD CREDIT DERIVATIVES REFLECTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS EXPOSURE IS MANAGED, AND REFLECTS, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE SUBSTANTIAL MITIGATION OF MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN ITS CREDIT DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. MARKET RISK IS SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED BECAUSE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OFTEN RESULT IN SELLING AND PURCHASING PROTECTION RELATED TO THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR EACH OF THE FIVE NAMED COUNTRIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE PROTECTION SOLD BY THE FIRM WAS MORE THAN

94%

OFFSET BY PROTECTION PURCHASED ON THE IDENTICAL REFERENCE ENTITY.

IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK HAS ALSO BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED BY THE MASTER NETTING AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS IN PLACE FOR THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

100%

OF THE PURCHASED PROTECTION PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE IS PURCHASED UNDER CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE POSTING OF CASH COLLATERAL;

88%

IS PURCHASED FROM INVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES DOMICILED OUTSIDE OF THE SELECTED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; AND

68%

OF THE PROTECTION PURCHASED OFFSETS PROTECTION SOLD ON THE IDENTICAL REFERENCE ENTITY, WITH THE IDENTICAL COUNTERPARTY SUBJECT TO A MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

MODEL RISK

THE FIRM USES MODELS, FOR MANY PURPOSES, BUT PRIMARILY FOR THE MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS. VALUATION MODELS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM TO VALUE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH CANNOT OTHERWISE BE VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES. THESE VALUATION MODELS MAY ALSO BE EMPLOYED AS INPUTS TO RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS, INCLUDING VAR AND ECONOMIC STRESS MODELS. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES USE OF MODELS FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE CALCULATION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

MODELS ARE OWNED BY VARIOUS FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE FIRM BASED ON THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF SUCH MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, VAR MODELS AND CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS ARE OWNED BY THE LINE-OF-BUSINESS ALIGNED RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. OWNERS OF MODELS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING OF THEIR MODELS, AS WELL AS REFERRAL OF MODELS TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION (WITHIN THE MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT) FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. ONCE MODELS HAVE BEEN APPROVED, MODEL OWNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A ROBUST OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND MUST MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MODEL OWNERS MAY SEEK TO ENHANCE MODELS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PORTFOLIOS AND FOR CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS TO CAPTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN AVAILABLE MODELING TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION IS PART OF THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT, WHICH IN TURN REPORTS TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MODEL OWNERS AND REVIEWS AND APPROVES A WIDE RANGE OF MODELS, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT, VALUATION AND CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS USED BY THE FIRM.

MODELS ARE TIERED BASED ON AN INTERNAL STANDARD ACCORDING TO THEIR COMPLEXITY, THE EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODEL AND THE FIRM’S RELIANCE ON THE MODEL. THIS TIERING IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION. A MODEL REVIEW CONDUCTED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION CONSIDERS THE MODEL’S

SUITABILITY FOR THE SPECIFIC USES TO WHICH IT WILL BE PUT. THE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN REVIEWING A MODEL INCLUDE WHETHER THE MODEL ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SELECTION AND RELIABILITY OF MODEL INPUTS, CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY MODEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED FROM THE MARKET. WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES. MODEL REVIEWS ARE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION BASED ON THE RELEVANT TIER OF THE MODEL.

UNDER THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY, NEW MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION IN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION DOES NOT APPROVE A MODEL, THE MODEL OWNER IS REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE THE MODEL WITHIN A TIME PERIOD AGREED UPON WITH THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION. THE MODEL OWNER IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RESUBMIT THE MODEL FOR REVIEW TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE MODEL RISK IF IT IS TO BE USED IN THE INTERIM. THESE ACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE MODEL AND MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM MAY ALSO IMPLEMENT OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MEASUREMENT TOOLS TO AUGMENT THE MODEL THAT IS SUBJECT TO REMEDIATION.

EXCEPTIONS TO THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY MAY BE GRANTED BY THE HEAD OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION TO ALLOW A MODEL TO BE USED PRIOR TO REVIEW OR APPROVAL.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY PRIVATELY-HELD FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INSTRUMENTS, TYPICALLY REPRESENTING AN OWNERSHIP OR JUNIOR CAPITAL POSITION, THAT HAVE UNIQUE RISKS DUE TO THEIR ILLIQUIDITY OR FOR WHICH THERE IS LESS OBSERVABLE MARKET OR VALUATION DATA. SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, MEZZANINE FINANCING, AND TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS ARE TYPICALLY INTENDED TO BE HELD OVER EXTENDED INVESTMENT PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NO EXPECTATION FOR SHORT-TERM GAIN WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO MANAGING PRINCIPAL RISK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. A FIRM-WIDE RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK EXISTS FOR ALL PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES. ALL INVESTMENTS ARE APPROVED BY INVESTMENT COMMITTEES THAT INCLUDE EXECUTIVES WHO ARE INDEPENDENT FROM THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING, VALUATION AND RISK POLICIES. TARGETED LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIOS. INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC, AND POSITION LEVEL

CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS STRESS TESTING ON THESE PORTFOLIOS USING SPECIFIC SCENARIOS THAT ESTIMATE LOSSES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET MOVES AND/OR OTHER RISK EVENTS.

THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE MANAGED UNDER VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS AND ARE CAPTURED WITHIN THE RESPECTIVE LOB’S FINANCIAL RESULTS. PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COVER MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES AND OCCUR EITHER AS A STANDALONE INVESTING BUSINESSES OR AS PART OF A BROADER BUSINESS PLATFORM. ASSET CLASSES INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY, TAX EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND MEZZANINE/JUNIOR DEBT INVESTMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S PRIVATE EQUITY IS REPORTED SEPARATELY UNDER CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY (FOR DETAILED INFORMATION, SEE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO ON PAGE 111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT).

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES, INCLUDING LITIGATION AND REGULATORY FINES, AS WELL AS OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM. TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS AN OVERALL FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AND ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

THE FRAMEWORK CLARIFIES.

TOOLS TO MEASURE, MONITOR, AND MITIGATE RISK

THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE FOCUS ON THE FIRM’S CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND DRIVE CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONAL AREAS, THE FIRM ESTABLISHED A FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP DURING 2012. OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL IS COMPRISED OF DEDICATED CONTROL OFFICERS WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONAL AREAS, AS WELL AS A CENTRAL OVERSIGHT TEAM. THE GROUP IS CHARGED WITH ENHANCING THE FIRM’S CONTROLS BY LOOKING WITHIN AND ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONAL AREAS TO IDENTIFY AND CONTROL ISSUES. THE GROUP ENABLES THE FIRM TO DETECT CONTROL PROBLEMS MORE QUICKLY, ESCALATE ISSUES PROMPTLY AND GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE INVOLVED TO UNDERSTAND COMMON THEMES AND INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FIRM. THE GROUP WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE FIRM’S OTHER CONTROL-RELATED FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE, LEGAL, INTERNAL AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT, TO EFFECTIVELY REMEDIATE IDENTIFIED CONTROL ISSUES ACROSS ALL AFFECTED AREAS OF THE FIRM. AS A RESULT, THE GROUP FACILITATES THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF THE

FIRM’S CONTROL FRAMEWORK AND HELPS SUPPORT OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE FIRM.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFINING THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE FRAMEWORK ACROSS THE FIRM.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ISSUES AND MITIGATE LOSSES BY SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD BASEL RISK EVENT CATEGORIES, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED THE OPERATIONAL RISK CATEGORIZATION TAXONOMY BELOW FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS.

KEY COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INCLUDE.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMWIDE CONTROL COMMITTEE (“FCC”) PROVIDES A FORUM FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW AND DIS

CUSS FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDING EXISTING AND EMERGING ISSUES AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL RISK METRICS, MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION. THE FCC SERVES AS AN ESCALATION POINT FOR SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RAISED FROM LOB AND FUNCTIONAL CONTROL COMMITTEES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH POTENTIAL ENTERPRISE-WIDE IMPACT. THE FCC (AS WELL AS THE LOB AND FUNCTIONAL CONTROL COMMITTEES) OVERSEES THE RISK AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH INCLUDES REVIEWING THE IDENTIFICATION, MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING OF OPERATIONAL RISK, CONTROL

ISSUES, REMEDIATION ACTIONS AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE TRENDS. THE FCC ESCALATES SIGNIFICANT ISSUES TO THE FRC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RISK IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE AND MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK, BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS UTILIZE THE FIRM’S STANDARD RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT (“RCSA”) PROCESS AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE. THE RCSA PROCESS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO IDENTIFY MATERIAL INHERENT OPERATIONAL RISKS, ASSESS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF RELEVANT CONTROLS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS, AND EVALUATE RESIDUAL RISK.

ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA, WHICH PERMITS ANALYSIS OF ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE OF BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE INFORMATION, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS, SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND THE STATUS OF ISSUE RESOLUTION TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS MEASURED USING A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED ON THE LOSS DISTRIBUTION APPROACH. THE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL USES ACTUAL LOSSES, A COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORY OF FORWARD LOOKING POTENTIAL LOSS SCENARIOS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT IN DETERMINING FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL. THIS METHODOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE BASEL FRAMEWORK. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

161–165

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK SYSTEM, WHICH INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER ACROSS THE FIRM.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND THE LOSS DATA-COLLECTION AND REPORTING ACTIVITIES.

INSURANCE

ONE OF THE WAYS OPERATIONAL LOSS IS MITIGATED IS THROUGH INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM PURCHASES INSURANCE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS (E.G., WORKERS COMPENSATION), AS WELL AS TO SERVE OTHER NEEDS (E.G., PROPERTY LOSS AND PUBLIC LIABILITY). INSURANCE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE PURCHASED IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

CYBERSECURITY

THE FIRM DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPDATE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS AGAINST ATTEMPTS BY THIRD PARTIES TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE. THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO DISRUPT ONLINE BANKING SERVICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO REGULARLY TARGETED BY THIRD-PARTIES USING MALICIOUS CODE AND VIRUSES, AND HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED OTHER ATTEMPTS TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS AND DATA WHICH, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, HAVE RESULTED IN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED, AND CONTINUES TO ESTABLISH, DEFENSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO MITIGATE THESE ATTACKS, AND THESE CYBERATTACKS HAVE NOT, TO DATE, RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, MATERIAL HARM TO THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS, AND HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS OR THAT FACILITATE THE FIRM’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (E.G., VENDORS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL DEPOSITORIES, AND FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES) COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF CYBERSECURITY RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF THEIR SYSTEMS, MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PARTIES, OR CYBERATTACKS WHICH COULD AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO THE FIRM OR RESULT IN LOST OR COMPROMISED INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR ITS CLIENTS.

THE FIRM IS WORKING WITH APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE FIRM'S THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE DEFENSES AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY TO CYBERSECURITY THREATS.

BUSINESS RESILIENCY

JPMORGAN CHASE’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS (I.E., STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES) IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH GLOBAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS THEY RELATE TO RESILIENCY RISK. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AWARENESS AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL INITIATIVES TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED, ASSESSED, AND MANAGED.

THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY TEAM HAS ESTABLISHED COMPREHENSIVE AND QUALITATIVE TRACKING AND REPORTING OF RESILIENCY PLANS IN ORDER TO PROACTIVELY ANTICIPATE AND MANAGE VARIOUS POTENTIAL DISRUPTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS SEVERE WEATHER, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FLOODING, MASS TRANSIT SHUTDOWNS AND TERRORIST THREATS,

AMONG OTHERS. THE RESILIENCY MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE FIRM INCLUDE BACKUP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DATA CENTERS, A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED WORKFORCE, DEDICATED RECOVERY FACILITIES, ENSURING TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT REMOTE WORK CAPACITY FOR DISPLACED STAFF AND ACCOMMODATION OF EMPLOYEES AT ALTERNATE LOCATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO COORDINATE ITS GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM ACROSS THE FIRM AND MITIGATE BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS BY REVIEWING AND TESTING RECOVERY PROCEDURES. THE STRENGTH AND PROFICIENCY OF THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM HAS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS DURING AND QUICKLY AFTER VARIOUS EVENTS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPERSTORM SANDY AND HURRICANE ISAAC IN THE U.S., MONSOON RAINS IN THE PHILIPPINES, TSUNAMIS IN ASIA, AND EARTHQUAKES IN LATIN AMERICA.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LEGAL RISK, REGULATORY RISK, AND COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM’S SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL, CREDIT, MARKET, PRINCIPAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE RECOGNITION AMONG ITS MANY CONSTITUENTS — CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES, INVESTORS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC — THAT THE FIRM ADHERES CONSISTENTLY TO A SET OF CORE VALUES THAT DRIVE THE WAY THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND HAS IN PLACE VARIOUS OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INTENDED TO PROMOTE ITS CORE VALUES AND THE FIRM’S CULTURE OF “DOING THE RIGHT THING” BY DOING “FIRST CLASS BUSINESS IN A FIRST CLASS WAY”.

THE FIRM HAS IN PLACE A CODE OF CONDUCT (THE “CODE”), AND EACH EMPLOYEE IS GIVEN ANNUAL TRAINING IN RESPECT OF THE CODE AND IS REQUIRED ANNUALLY TO AFFIRM HIS OR HER COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE. THE CODE SETS FORTH THE FIRM’S CORE PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, INCLUDING THAT NO EMPLOYEE SHOULD EVER SACRIFICE INTEGRITY – OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE OR SHE HAS – EVEN IF ONE THINKS IT WOULD HELP THE FIRM’S BUSINESS. THE CODE REQUIRES PROMPT REPORTING OF ANY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED VIOLATION OF THE CODE, ANY INTERNAL FIRM POLICY, OR ANY LAW OR REGULATION APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE REPORTING OF ANY ILLEGAL CONDUCT, OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE CODE, BY ANY OF THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT WORKERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, OR AGENTS. SPECIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED AND DESIGNATED AS “CODE SPECIALISTS” WHO ACT AS A RESOURCE TO EMPLOYEES ON CODE OF CONDUCT MATTERS. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS MAY BE REPORTED ANONYMOUSLY AND THE FIRM PROHIBITS RETALIATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES FOR THE GOOD FAITH REPORTING OF ANY ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRM’S CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, AND ITS REPUTATION. EACH OF THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT THAT OVERSEE AND APPROVE TRANSACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE FIRM ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSIDERING ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS OR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S CONFLICTS OFFICE EXAMINES THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM.

THE RISK OF LEGAL OR REGULATORY FINES OR SANCTIONS OR OF FINANCIAL DAMAGE OR LOSS DUE TO THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS, IS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE LEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT AND CONTROLS FUNCTIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRM HAS EXPERIENCED HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY BY ITS REGULATORS OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS, AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONTROLS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES. THE FIRM EXPECTS SUCH REGULATORY SCRUTINY WILL CONTINUE, AND THAT REGULATORS WILL INCREASINGLY USE FORMAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS CONSENT ORDERS) INSTEAD OF INFORMAL SUPERVISORY ACTIONS (SUCH AS “MATTERS REQUIRING ATTENTION”),  RESULTING IN FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND IMPOSITIONS OF FINES AND PENALTIES.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES AND ADVICE TO THE FIRM, AND COMMUNICATING AND HELPING BUSINESSES ADJUST TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHANGES FACING THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND EXPECTATIONS OF ITS REGULATORS, THE GLOBAL LEGAL FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PARTNERING WITH THE BUSINESSES TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS THE BUSINESSES’ ADHERENCE TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL EXPOSURES ON KEY LITIGATION AND TRANSACTIONAL MATTERS.

GLOBAL COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADVISING ON COMPLIANCE RISKS, ESTABLISHING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO MITIGATE AND CONTROL COMPLIANCE RISKS, IMPLEMENTING TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION FORUMS TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF COMPLIANCE RISKS, OVERSEEING REMEDIATION OF COMPLIANCE RISKS AND ISSUES, AND INDEPENDENTLY MONITORING AND TESTING THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE RISK CONTROLS.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE, TOGETHER WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTION, SHARE RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE BUSINESSES FOR IDENTIFYING LEGAL, COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY ISSUES, ESCALATING THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE FIRM’S RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, AND, AS NECESSARY, IN ASSISTING THE BUSINESSES IN THEIR REMEDIATION EFFORTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

FIDUCIARY RISK IS THE RISK OF FAILING TO EXERCISE THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF LOYALTY AND CARE, OR TO ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CLIENTS OR TO TREAT ALL CLIENTS FAIRLY AS REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN REGULATORY ACTION, REPUTATIONAL HARM OR FINANCIAL LIABILITY.

DEPENDING ON THE FIDUCIARY ACTIVITY AND CAPACITY IN WHICH THE FIRM IS ACTING, FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES, COMMON LAW AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO ADHERE TO SPECIFIC DUTIES IN WHICH THE FIRM MUST ALWAYS PLACE THE CLIENT’S INTERESTS ABOVE ITS OWN.

FIDUCIARY RISK GOVERNANCE

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RELEVANT LOB RISK COMMITTEES. SENIOR BUSINESS, LEGAL, RISK AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT, WHO HAVE PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIDUCIARY ISSUES, WORK WITH THE RELEVANT LOB RISK COMMITTEES WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING INVESTMENT, TRUSTS AND ESTATES, OR OTHER FIDUCIARY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS, PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. EACH LOB AND ITS RESPECTIVE RISK AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES. OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS’ RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS; CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATIONS; AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS. IN THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LOB RISK COMMITTEES PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE PERFORMANCE AND RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRM’S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE FIRM’S VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

DURING 2013 THE FIRM CREATED THE FIRMWIDE FIDUCIARY RISK COMMITTEE  (“FFRC”). THE FFRC PROVIDES A FORUM FOR DISCUSSING THE  RISKS INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES. THE COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A CROSS-LOB PROCESS TO SUPPORT THE CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION, ESCALATION AND REPORTING OF FIDUCIARY RISK ISSUES FIRMWIDE.  ISSUES FROM THE FFRC MAY BE ESCALATED TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRM’S REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE OF THE FIRM.

THE FIRM’S REPUTATION RISK POLICY EXPLICITLY VESTS EACH EMPLOYEE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSIDER THE REPUTATION OF THE FIRM, RATHER THAN BUSINESS BENEFITS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ALONE, IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PURSUE ANY NEW PRODUCT, TRANSACTION, CLIENT, OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITY. SINCE THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT COULD HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION ARE SO VARIED ACROSS THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS, EACH LINE OF BUSINESS HAS A SEPARATE REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE, WHICH COMPRISES THREE KEY ELEMENTS: CLEAR, DOCUMENTED ESCALATION CRITERIA APPROPRIATE TO THE BUSINESS FOOTPRINT; A DESIGNATED PRIMARY DISCUSSION FORUM – IN MOST CASES, ONE OR MORE DEDICATED REPUTATION RISK COMMITTEES; AND A LIST OF DESIGNATED CONTACTS. LINE OF BUSINESS REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE IS OVERSEEN BY A FIRMWIDE REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE FUNCTION, WHICH PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESS TO SUPPORT THE CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION, ESCALATION, MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF REPUTATION RISK ISSUES FIRMWIDE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION. THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRATEGY FOCUSES ON LONG-TERM STABILITY, WHICH ENABLES THE FIRM TO BUILD AND INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SENIOR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S EARNINGS OUTLOOK, SENIOR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL WITH A VIEW TO PRESERVING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRENGTH. MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET TO MANAGE THROUGH ECONOMIC VOLATILITY IS CONSIDERED A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CEO AND OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, STRONG CAPITAL AND RESERVES, AND ROBUST LIQUIDITY.

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO HOLD CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO.

•

COVER ALL MATERIAL RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;

•

MAINTAIN “WELL-CAPITALIZED” STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

•

MAINTAIN DEBT RATINGS THAT ENABLE THE FIRM TO OPTIMIZE ITS FUNDING MIX AND LIQUIDITY SOURCES WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS;

•

RETAIN FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES;

•

MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO BUILD AND INVEST IN ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH THE CYCLE AND IN STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS; AND

•

DISTRIBUTE EXCESS CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS WHILE BALANCING OTHER STATED OBJECTIVES.

THESE OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH ONGOING MONITORING OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION, REGULAR STRESS TESTING, AND A CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO REACT TO A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EVENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS FIRMWIDE AND LOB PROCESSES FOR ONGOING MONITORING AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ITS CAPITAL POSITION.

CAPITAL STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

THE FIRM’S CEO AND OPERATING COMMITTEE ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES FOR CAPITAL PLANNING, CAPITAL ISSUANCE, USAGE AND DISTRIBUTIONS; AND, ESTABLISH CAPITAL TARGETS AND MINIMUMS FOR THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL IN BOTH BUSINESS-AS-USUAL AND HIGHLY-STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS.

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL TARGETS AND MINIMUMS ARE CALIBRATED TO THE U.S. BASEL III REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM’S TARGET TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH, ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS, IS 10%+. THIS LONG-TERM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO TARGET LEVEL WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO RETAIN MARKET ACCESS, CONTINUE THE FIRM’S STRATEGY TO INVEST IN AND GROW ITS BUSINESSES; AND, MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO DISTRIBUTE EXCESS CAPITAL. THE FIRM INTENDS TO MANAGE ITS CAPITAL SO THAT IT ACHIEVES THE REQUIRED CAPITAL LEVELS AND COMPOSITION

DURING THE TRANSITION FROM BASEL I TO BASEL III, IN LINE WITH, OR AHEAD OF, THE REQUIRED TIMETABLE.

THE FIRM’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF A CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT SUPPORTS STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED THE CAPITAL GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE REGULATORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE (“RCMO”) AS KEY COMPONENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS OBJECTIVE. THE CAPITAL GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY AND THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING CAPITAL ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION ALTERNATIVES. THE COMMITTEE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNING THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS, INCLUDING OVERALL DESIGN, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISK STREAMS, AND ENSURING THAT CAPITAL STRESS TEST PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE IDIOSYNCRATIC RISKS ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. THE RCMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING, APPROVING AND MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POLICIES AND STRATEGIES, AS WELL AS ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE ASSESSES THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS AND ITS COMPONENTS. THIS REVIEW ENCOMPASSES DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE RISK TOLERANCE LEVELS, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE.

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS

SEMIANNUALLY, THE FIRM COMPLETES THE INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS (“ICAAP”), WHICH PROVIDES MANAGEMENT WITH A VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF SEVERE AND UNEXPECTED EVENTS ON EARNINGS, BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS, RESERVES AND CAPITAL. THE FIRM’S ICAAP INTEGRATES STRESS TESTING PROTOCOLS WITH CAPITAL PLANNING.

THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND CAPITAL. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE KEY DRIVERS OF BUSINESS RESULTS; GLOBAL MARKET SHOCKS, WHICH GENERATE SHORT-TERM BUT SEVERE TRADING LOSSES; AND IDIOSYNCRATIC OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. THE SCENARIOS ARE INTENDED TO CAPTURE AND STRESS KEY VULNERABILITIES AND IDIOSYNCRATIC RISKS FACING THE FIRM. HOWEVER, WHEN DEFINING A BROAD RANGE OF SCENARIOS, REALIZED EVENTS CAN ALWAYS BE WORSE. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS, AS NECESSARY. ICAAP RESULTS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”)

THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE USES THE CCAR AND DODD-FRANK ACT WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”) STRESS TEST PROCESSES

160

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

TO ENSURE THAT LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS, AND HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT ADDRESS EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S UNIQUE RISKS TO ENABLE THEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB LOSSES UNDER CERTAIN STRESS SCENARIOS. THROUGH THE CCAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE EVALUATES EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESSES, AS WELL AS ITS PLANS TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR STOCK REPURCHASES.

THE FIRM’S CCAR PROCESS IS INTEGRATED INTO AND EMPLOYS THE SAME METHODOLOGIES UTILIZED IN THE FIRM’S ICAAP PROCESS. ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2013 CCAR PROCESS. ON MARCH 14, 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INFORMED THE FIRM THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO THE FIRM’S 2013 CAPITAL PLAN, BUT ASKED THE FIRM TO SUBMIT AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL PLAN.

ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2013, THE FIRM SUBMITTED THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL PLAN WHICH ADDRESSED THE WEAKNESSES THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAD IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRM’S ORIGINAL 2013 SUBMISSION. ON DECEMBER 2, 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INFORMED THE FIRM IT DID NOT OBJECT TO THE FIRM’S 2013 CAPITAL PLAN, AS RESUBMITTED.

ON JANUARY 6, 2014, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS 2014 CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2014 CCAR PROCESS. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FINAL RESPONSE TO ITS PLAN NO LATER THAN MARCH 14, 2014.

CAPITAL DISCIPLINES

THE FIRM USES THREE PRIMARY CAPITAL DISCIPLINES.

•

REGULATORY CAPITAL

•

ECONOMIC CAPITAL

•

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS, FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“OCC”) ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRM’S NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009 (“SCAP”), U.S. BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY, SUCH AS PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. IN 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE EMPLOYED A MINIMUM 5% TIER 1 COMMON RATIO STANDARD FOR CCAR PURPOSES, IN ADDITION TO OTHER MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, TO ASSESS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY. FOR THE 2014 CCAR PROCESS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INTRODUCED A REQUIREMENT TO INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON STANDARDS, A BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON TEST WITH A MINIMUM OF 4% FOR 2014 PROJECTIONS AND 4.5% FOR 2015 PROJECTIONS.

BASEL I AND BASEL 2.5

THE MINIMUM U.S. RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT ON DECEMBER 31, 2013, FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD (“BASEL I”) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE. IN JUNE 2012, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED THE FINAL RULE THAT SPECIFIES REVISED MARKET RISK REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (“BASEL 2.5”). WHILE THE FIRM IS STILL SUBJECT TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF BASEL I, BASEL 2.5 RULES ALSO BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THE BASEL 2.5 FINAL RULE REVISED THE SCOPE OF POSITIONS SUBJECT TO THE MARKET RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND INTRODUCED NEW MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COVERED POSITIONS AS DEFINED. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BASEL 2.5 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $150 BILLION IN RWA COMPARED WITH THE BASEL I RULES AT MARCH 31, 2013. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES ALSO RESULTED IN DECREASES OF THE FIRM’S TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL CAPITAL AND TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL RATIOS BY 140 BASIS POINTS, 160 BASIS POINTS AND 120 BASIS POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, AT MARCH 31, 2013.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S BASEL 2.5 MEASURES AND ADDITIONAL MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES, SEE THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BASEL 2.5 MARKET RISK PILLAR 3 REPORTS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON THE FIRM’S WEBSITE (HTTP://INVESTOR.SHAREHOLDER.COM/JPMORGANCHASE/BASEL.CFM) WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2013.

BASEL II & BASEL III

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BE MORE RISK SENSITIVE THAN BASEL I AND EVENTUALLY REPLACE BASEL I FOR LARGE AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE U.S. BANKS, INCLUDING THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS BEEN REPORTING BASEL II CAPITAL RATIOS IN PARALLEL TO THE BANKING AGENCIES SINCE 2008. IN OCTOBER 2013, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED AN INTERIM FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE CAPITAL ACCORD IN THE U.S.; SUCH FURTHER REVISIONS ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “BASEL III.” BASEL III IS COMPRISED OF A  STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND AN ADVANCED APPROACH. FOR LARGE AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, BOTH THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES BECAME EFFECTIVE COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2014.

FOR 2014, THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO CALCULATE ITS CAPITAL RATIOS USING THE BASEL III DEFINITION OF CAPITAL DIVIDED BY THE BASEL I DEFINITION OF RWA, INCLUSIVE OF BASEL 2.5 FOR MARKET RISK. COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2015 THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO CALCULATE THE RATIOS USING THE BASEL III DEFINITION OF CAPITAL DIVIDED BY THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED RWA, INCLUSIVE OF BASEL 2.5 FOR MARKET RISK.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A QUALIFICATION PERIOD (“PARALLEL RUN”) OF AT LEAST FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS (INCLUSIVE OF QUARTERS IN WHICH THE FIRM REPORTED IN PARALLEL UNDER BASEL II) DURING WHICH IT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FIRM, UPON EXITING THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH PARALLEL RUN, WILL BE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES. THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY WILL BE EVALUATED AGAINST THE APPROACH THAT RESULTS IN THE LOWER RATIO.

BASEL III REVISES BASEL I AND II BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, AND INCREASING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES. BASEL III INTRODUCES A NEW TIER 1 COMMON RATIO REQUIREMENT WHICH HAS A PHASE-IN PERIOD FROM 2015 TO 2019. BY JANUARY 1, 2019, THE MINIMUM TIER 1 COMMON RATIO REQUIREMENT IS 7%, COMPRISED OF A MINIMUM RATIO OF 4.5% PLUS A 2.5% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER.

GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (“GSIBS”) WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TIER 1 COMMON REQUIREMENTS ABOVE THE 7% MINIMUM, IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM AN ADDITIONAL 1% TO AN ADDITIONAL 2.5%. IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (“FSB”) INDICATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THE FIRM, AS WELL AS ONE OTHER BANK, TO HOLD THE ADDITIONAL 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON; THE REQUIREMENT WILL BE PHASED IN BEGINNING IN 2016. THE BASEL COMMITTEE ALSO STATED THAT CERTAIN GSIBS COULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD AS MUCH AS AN ADDITIONAL 3.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON ABOVE THE 7% MINIMUM IF THEY WERE TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT FURTHER INCREASE THEIR SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. CURRENTLY, NO GSIB (INCLUDING THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

163

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FIRM) IS REQUIRED TO HOLD MORE THAN THE ADDITIONAL 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON.

IN ADDITION, BASEL III ESTABLISHES A 6.5% TIER I COMMON EQUITY STANDARD FOR THE DEFINITION OF “WELL CAPITALIZED”

UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (“PCA”) REQUIREMENTS OF THE FDIC IMPROVEMENT ACT (“FDICIA”). THE TIER I COMMON EQUITY STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.

THE FOLLOWING CHART PRESENTS THE BASEL III MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS AND ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS. THE CHART ALSO INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S TARGET FOR THE FIRM’S TIER 1 COMMON RATIO. IT IS THE FIRM’S CURRENT EXPECTATION THAT ITS BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON RATIO WILL EXCEED THE REGULATORY MINIMUMS, BOTH DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD AND UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN 2019 AND THEREAFTER.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS WOULD BE

9.5%

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, ACHIEVING MANAGEMENT’S PREVIOUSLY STATED OBJECTIVES. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO AS CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH IS ESTIMATED AT 9.4% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BOTH BASEL I AND BASEL III ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, SUCH MEASURES ARE USED BY BANK REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION AND TO COMPARE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL TO THAT OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM’S TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I RULES TO ITS ESTIMATED TIER 1 COMMON UNDER THE ADVANCED APPROACH OF THE BASEL III RULES, ALONG WITH THE FIRM’S ESTIMATED RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE CALCULATION OF RWA BETWEEN BASEL I AND BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH INCLUDE: (1) BASEL III CREDIT RISK RWA IS BASED ON RISK-SENSITIVE APPROACHES WHICH LARGELY RELY ON THE USE OF INTERNAL CREDIT MODELS AND PARAMETERS, WHEREAS BASEL I RWA IS BASED ON FIXED SUPERVISORY RISK-WEIGHTINGS WHICH VARY ONLY BY COUNTERPARTY TYPE AND ASSET CLASS; AND (2) BASEL III INCLUDES RWA FOR OPERATIONAL RISK, WHEREAS BASEL I DOES NOT. OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION OPERATIONAL LOSSES IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE LOSSES WERE REALIZED, AND THE CALCULATION GENERALLY INCORPORATES SUCH LOSSES IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE ISSUES OR BUSINESS ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN REMEDIATED OR REDUCED. THE FIRM’S

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL CONTINUES TO BE REFINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRM’S BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH PARALLEL RUN. AS A RESULT OF MODEL ENHANCEMENTS IN 2013, AS WELL AS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LEGAL EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE FIRM IN 2013, THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2013 OVER 2012.

TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL III INCLUDES ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS AND DEDUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON, SUCH AS THE INCLUSION OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (“AOCI”) RELATED TO AFS SECURITIES AND DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (“OPEB”) PLANS.

(C)

THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL III RULES IS TIER 1 COMMON DIVIDED BY RWA UNDER BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ITS TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS WOULD BE

10.2%

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AS CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS IS ESTIMATED AT 10.1% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT OBJECTIVE IS FOR THE FIRM TO REACH AN ESTIMATED BASEL III TIER I COMMON RATIO OF 10%+ AND A BASEL III TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 11.0%, BOTH BY THE END OF 2014. TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL AND THE TIER 1 COMMON AND TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL III ARE ALL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, SUCH MEASURES ARE USED BY BANK REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION AND TO COMPARE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL TO THAT OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.

THE BASEL III INTERIM FINAL RULE ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO CALCULATE A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (“SLR”). THE SLR, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER BASEL III DIVIDED BY THE FIRM’S TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY TAKING THE FIRM’S TOTAL AVERAGE ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS, LESS AMOUNTS PERMITTED TO BE DEDUCTED FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL, AND ADDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, SUCH AS UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVES FUTURE EXPOSURE.

FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE BASEL III INTERIM FINAL RULE, THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED PROPOSED RULEMAKING RELATING TO THE SLR THAT WOULD REQUIRE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE, TO HAVE A MINIMUM SLR OF AT LEAST 5% AND INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (“IDI”), INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., TO HAVE A MINIMUM SLR OF AT LEAST 6%. THE FIRM AND ITS IDI SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE MINIMUM SLR UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018. THE FIRM ESTIMATES, BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE U.S. RULES, THAT IF THE RULES WERE IN EFFECT AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FIRM’S SLR WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 4.7% AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S SLR WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 4.7%. MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE AN SLR OF 5.5% FOR THE FIRM AND AN SLR OF 6% FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A, EACH IN ADVANCE OF THE SLR EFFECTIVE DATE.

ON JANUARY 12, 2014, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED A REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE DENOMINATOR OF THE SLR. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THESE REVISIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO REDUCE EACH OF THE FIRM’S SLR AND J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S SLR BY 10 BASIS POINTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES OF ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL III AND OF THE FIRM’S AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S SLR REFLECT ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE U.S. BASEL III RULES

BASED ON THE CURRENT PUBLISHED RULES AND ON THE APPLICATION OF SUCH RULES TO ITS BUSINESSES AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED. THE ACTUAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL AND SLR RATIOS AT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE RULES MAY DIFFER FROM THE FIRM’S CURRENT ESTIMATES DEPENDING ON CHANGES THE FIRM MAY MAKE TO ITS BUSINESSES IN THE FUTURE, FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FROM THE REGULATORS, AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MODELS (OR, ALTERNATIVELY, REGULATORY DISAPPROVAL OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MODELS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONDITIONALLY APPROVED).

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL IS ANOTHER OF THE DISCIPLINES THE FIRM USES TO ASSESS THE CAPITAL REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESSES. ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL IS A MEASURE OF THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO COVER JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE EVENT OF UNEXPECTED LOSSES. THE FIRM MEASURES ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL USING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES AND MODELS BASED PRIMARILY ON FOUR RISK FACTORS: CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK AND CONSIDERS FACTORS, ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE REQUIRED TO BE USED FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL PROVIDES A COMPLEMENTARY MEASURE TO REGULATORY CAPITAL. AS ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL IS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS UNDER BASEL III, THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF ENHANCING ITS ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE BASEL III INTERIM FINAL RULE.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRM’S FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.

•

INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE AND LINE OF BUSINESS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES;

•

MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND

•

PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, CONSIDERING CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (AS ESTIMATED UNDER BASEL III) AND ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES. CAPITAL IS ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS. ROE IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS KEY MEASURES OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT’S PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRM MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE REPURCHASES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE ITS EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON EQUITY — FOR EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING “BLACK-OUT PERIODS.” ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

THE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE COMMON EQUITY WILL BE UTILIZED AT MANAGEMENT’S DISCRETION, AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND THE EXACT AMOUNT OF COMMON EQUITY THAT MAY BE REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, COMPOSITION AND TENOR OF FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY IN SUPPORT OF ITS ASSETS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ARE TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM’S CORE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF CLIENT NEEDS AND MEET CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH NORMAL ECONOMIC CYCLES, AS WELL AS DURING MARKET STRESS EVENTS, AND TO MAINTAIN DEBT RATINGS THAT ENABLE THE FIRM TO OPTIMIZE ITS FUNDING MIX AND LIQUIDITY SOURCES WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS.

THE FIRM MANAGES LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING USING A CENTRALIZED, GLOBAL APPROACH IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND USES FOR THE FIRM AS A WHOLE, MONITOR EXPOSURES, IDENTIFY CONSTRAINTS ON THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDITY AMONG LEGAL ENTITIES WITHIN THE FIRM, AND MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS LIQUIDITY AS PART OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

MEASURING, MANAGING, MONITORING AND REPORTING THE FIRM’S CURRENT AND PROJECTED LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND USES;

•

UNDERSTANDING THE LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES;

•

DEFINING AND MONITORING FIRMWIDE AND LEGAL ENTITY LIQUIDITY STRATEGIES, POLICIES, GUIDELINES, AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANS;

•

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING UNDER A VARIETY OF ADVERSE SCENARIOS

•

MANAGING FUNDING MIX AND DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS SHORT-TERM CASH;

•

DEFINING AND IMPLEMENTING FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING (“FTP”) ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND REGIONS; AND

•

DEFINING AND ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY CHANGES ON FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY.

THE FIRM HAS A LIQUIDITY RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK TO REVIEW, APPROVE AND MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LIQUIDITY RISK POLICIES AT THE FIRMWIDE, REGIONAL AND LINE OF BUSINESS LEVELS.

SPECIFIC RISK COMMITTEES RESPONSIBLE FOR LIQUIDITY RISK GOVERNANCE INCLUDE ALCO AS WELL AS LINES OF BUSINESS AND REGIONAL ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES, AND THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RISK COMMITTEES, SEE ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES

113–173

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IN ADDITION, DURING 2013, THE FIRM ESTABLISHED AN INDEPENDENT LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT FUNCTION REPORTING INTO THE CIO, TREASURY AND CORPORATE (“CTC”) CRO, WHICH PROVIDES INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS AND MONITORING OF LIQUIDITY RISK ACROSS THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POSITION TO BE STRONG AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND BELIEVES THAT THE FIRM’S UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

LCR AND NSFR

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE INTRODUCED TWO NEW MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK: THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (“LCR”), WHICH IS INTENDED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF “HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS” (“HQLA”) HELD BY THE FIRM IN RELATION TO ESTIMATED NET CASH OUTFLOWS WITHIN A 30-DAY PERIOD DURING AN ACUTE STRESS EVENT; AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (“NSFR”) WHICH IS INTENDED TO MEASURE THE “AVAILABLE” AMOUNT OF STABLE FUNDING RELATIVE TO THE “REQUIRED” AMOUNT OF STABLE FUNDING OVER A ONE-YEAR HORIZON. THE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT THE LCR BE NO LOWER THAN 100% AND THE NSFR BE GREATER THAN 100%.

IN JANUARY 2013, THE BASEL COMMITTEE INTRODUCED CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE FORMULATION OF THE LCR, AND A REVISED TIMETABLE TO PHASE IN THE STANDARD. THE LCR WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, BUT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WILL BEGIN AT 60%, INCREASING IN EQUAL ANNUAL INCREMENTS TO REACH 100% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FIRM WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE BASEL III LCR. THE LCR MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO NORMAL FLOWS FROM CLIENT ACTIVITY.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2013, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS RELEASED A PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A U.S. QUANTITATIVE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT CONSISTENT WITH, BUT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN, BASEL III LCR FOR LARGE BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES(“U.S. LCR”). THE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES FOR AN ACCELERATED TRANSITION PERIOD COMPARED TO THAT W

HICH IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL III LCR RULES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FIRM WAS ALSO COMPLIANT WITH THE U.S. LCR BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSED RULES.

ON JANUARY 12, 2014, THE BASEL COMMITTEE RELEASED PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE NSFR. BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSED REVISIONS, THE FIRM WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE NSFR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

THE FIRM FUNDS ITS GLOBAL BALANCE SHEET THROUGH DIVERSE SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDING A STABLE DEPOSIT FRANCHISE AS WELL AS SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO, AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY $722.2 BILLION, NET OF ALLOWANCE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, IS FUNDED WITH A PORTION OF THE FIRM’S DEPOSITS (AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY

RISK CHARACTERISTICS. CAPITAL MARKETS SECURED FINANCING ASSETS AND TRADING ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED BY THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MARKET SECURED FINANCING LIABILITIES, TRADING LIABILITIES AND A PORTION OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY.

IN ADDITION TO FUNDING CAPITAL MARKETS ASSETS, PROCEEDS FROM THE FIRM’S DEBT AND EQUITY ISSUANCES ARE USED TO FUND CERTAIN LOANS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, OR MAY BE INVESTED IN THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. SEE THE DISCUSSION BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES RELATING TO DEPOSITS, SHORT-TERM FUNDING, AND LONG-TERM FUNDING AND ISSUANCE.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRM’S TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES, APPROXIMATELY

70%

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, ARE NOT SOURCED FROM WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS, BUT WERE ORIGINATED FROM DEPOSITS THAT CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO SWEEP INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES AS A CASH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM.

THE FIRM’S SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED FUNDING PRIMARILY CONSIST OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE. SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE ARE SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES COLLATERAL, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT, AGENCY DEBT AND AGENCY MBS, AND CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THE AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING SOURCES. THE BALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FLUCTUATE OVER TIME DUE TO CUSTOMERS’ INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES; THE FIRM’S DEMAND FOR FINANCING; THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ITS SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING (FOR BOTH THE INVESTMENT AND MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS); AND OTHER MARKET AND PORTFOLIO FACTORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

LONG-TERM FUNDING AND ISSUANCE

LONG-TERM FUNDING PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF STABLE FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM.

LONG-TERM FUNDING OBJECTIVES INCLUDE MAINTAINING DIVERSIFICATION, MAXIMIZING MARKET ACCESS AND OPTIMIZING FUNDING COST, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PRE-FUNDING AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY. THE FIRM EVALUATES VARIOUS FUNDING MARKETS, TENORS AND CURRENCIES IN CREATING ITS OPTIMAL LONG-TERM FUNDING PLAN.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS ISSUED BY THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN SUPPORT OF BOTH BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARY FUNDING. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES LONG-TERM UNSECURED ISSUANCE AND MATURITIES OR REDEMPTION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

IN ADDITION, FROM JANUARY 1, 2014, THROUGH FEBRUARY 19, 2014, THE FIRM ISSUED $12.7 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES.

THE FIRM RAISES SECURED LONG-TERM FUNDING THROUGH SECURITIZATION OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD LOANS AND ADVANCES FROM THE FHLBS. IT MAY ALSO IN THE FUTURE RAISE LONG-TERM FUNDING THROUGH SECURITIZATION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AUTO LOANS AND STUDENT LOANS, WHICH WILL INCREASE FUNDING AND INVESTOR DIVERSITY.

PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY FUNDING

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY ACTS AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IS MAINTAINED AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IN A STRESS ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACCESS TO NORMAL FUNDING SOURCES IS DISRUPTED.

TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR THE ADEQUACY OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM USES THREE PRIMARY MEASURES.

•

NUMBER OF MONTHS OF PRE-FUNDING: THE FIRM TARGETS PRE-FUNDING OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT BOTH CONTRACTUAL AND NON-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS CAN BE MET FOR AT LEAST 18 MONTHS ASSUMING NO ACCESS TO WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS. HOWEVER, DUE TO CONSERVATIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM, THE CURRENT PRE-FUNDING OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS IS GREATER THAN TARGET.

•

EXCESS CASH: EXCESS CASH IS MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT DAILY CASH REQUIREMENTS CAN BE MET IN BOTH NORMAL AND STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS. EXCESS CASH GENERATED BY PARENT HOLDING COMPANY ISSUANCE ACTIVITY IS PLACED ON DEPOSIT WITH OR IS ADVANCED TO BOTH BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OR HELD AS LIQUID COLLATERAL PURCHASED THROUGH REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

•

STRESS TESTING: THE FIRM CONDUCTS REGULAR STRESS TESTING FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES TO

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ITS SUBSIDIARIES’ ABILITY TO GENERATE REPLACEMENT FUNDING IN THE EVENT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPOSITS AND ADVANCES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE STRESS TESTING DISCUSSION BELOW.

HQLA

HQLA IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF ASSETS THE FIRM BELIEVES WILL QUALIFY FOR INCLUSION IN THE BASEL III LCR. HQLA PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF CASH AND CERTAIN UNENCUMBERED HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID ASSETS AS DEFINED IN THE RULE.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, HQLA WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $522 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $341 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE INCREASE IN HQLA WAS DUE TO HIGHER CASH BALANCES PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEPOSITS AND LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE, AS WELL AS BY A REDUCTION IN TRADING ASSETS. HQLA MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO NORMAL FLOWS FROM CLIENT ACTIVITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE ESTIMATED BASEL III LCR HQLA BROKEN OUT BY HQLA-ELIGIBLE CASH AND HQLA-ELIGIBLE SECURITIES AS OF

TABLE REPRESENTS BASEL III LCR HQLA. HQLA UNDER PROPOSED U.S. LCR IS ESTIMATED TO BE LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN SECURITY TYPES BASED ON THE FIRM’S UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSED RULE.

IN ADDITION TO HQLA, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE FIRM HAS APPROXIMATELY $282 BILLION OF UNENCUMBERED MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SUCH AS EQUITY SECURITIES AND FIXED INCOME DEBT SECURITIES, AVAILABLE TO RAISE LIQUIDITY, IF REQUIRED. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM MAINTAINS BORROWING CAPACITY AT VARIOUS FHLBS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A RESULT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY THE FIRM TO SUCH BANKS. ALTHOUGH AVAILABLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW THE BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND THE VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE FIRM’S REMAINING BORROWING CAPACITY AT VARIOUS FHLBS AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW WAS APPROXIMATELY $109 BILLION. THIS BORROWING CAPACITY EXCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES INCLUDED ABOVE IN HQLA OR OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS NOT DRAWN LIQUIDITY.

STRESS TESTING

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM UNDER A VARIETY OF ADVERSE SCENARIOS. RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED IN THE FORMULATION OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING PLAN AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION. LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS ARE MODELED ACROSS A RANGE OF TIME HORIZONS AND VARYING DEGREES OF MARKET AND IDIOSYNCRATIC STRESS. STANDARD STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AD HOC STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. STRESS SCENARIOS ARE PRODUCED FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FIRM’S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, SEPARATE REGIONAL LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING IS PERFORMED.

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ASSUME ALL OF THE FIRM’S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MET AND THEN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARYING LEVELS OF ACCESS TO UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO POTENTIAL NON-CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.

•

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

THE FIRM’S CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN (“CFP”), WHICH IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY ALCO, PROVIDES A DOCUMENTED FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING BOTH TEMPORARY AND LONGER-TERM UNEXPECTED ADVERSE LIQUIDITY STRESS. THE CFP INCORPORATES THE LIMITS AND INDICATORS SET BY THE LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT GROUP. THESE LIMITS AND INDICATORS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY TO IDENTIFY EMERGING RISKS OR INCREASED VULNERABILITIES IN THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE CFP IS ALSO REGULARLY UPDATED TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY RESOURCES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED UNDER ADVERSE LIQUIDITY CIRCUMSTANCES.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM’S FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD

PARTY COMMITMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN CREDIT RATINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES ON PAGE

ON JUNE 11, 2013, S&P ANNOUNCED A REASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT ASSUMPTIONS REFLECTED IN ITS HOLDING COMPANY RATINGS OF EIGHT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM. AS A RESULT OF THIS REASSESSMENT, THE OUTLOOK FOR THE PARENT COMPANY WAS REVISED TO NEGATIVE FROM STABLE; THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRM’S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES REMAINED UNCHANGED AT STABLE.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2013, MOODY’S DOWNGRADED THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BASED ON MOODY’S REASSESSMENT OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO IMPLICIT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SUCH COMPANIES. SPECIFICALLY, MOODY’S DOWNGRADED THE SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND CO., AND THE SUBORDINATED DEBT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND UPGRADED THE LONG-TERM ISSUER RATING OF JPMORGAN SECURITIES. THE PARENT COMPANY DOWNGRADE ALSO RESULTED IN MOODY’S DOWNGRADE OF THE PARENT COMPANY’S SHORT-TERM RATING. THE RATING ACTIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDS OR ITS ABILITY TO FUND ITSELF.

ADDITIONAL DOWNGRADES OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM RATINGS BY ONE NOTCH OR TWO NOTCHES COULD RESULT IN A FURTHER DOWNGRADE OF THE FIRM’S SHORT-TERM RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS COST OF FUNDS COULD INCREASE AND ACCESS TO CERTAIN FUNDING MARKETS COULD BE REDUCED. THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OF FURTHER RATINGS DOWNGRADES DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS CONTRACTUAL AND

BEHAVIORAL FACTORS (WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES ARE INCORPORATED IN ITS LIQUIDITY RISK AND STRESS TESTING METRICS). THE FIRM BELIEVES IT MAINTAINS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO WITHSTAND A POTENTIAL DECREASE IN FUNDING CAPACITY DUE TO FURTHER RATINGS DOWNGRADES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNSECURED DEBT DOES NOT CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, PROVIDE ANY LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE BORROWINGS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, BASED ON UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, OR STOCK PRICE.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES. RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, RATING UPLIFT ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, FUTURE PROFITABILITY, RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND LEGAL EXPENSES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE RATINGS ACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND ENDEAVORS TO MANAGE FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS CREDIT RATINGS WILL NOT BE FURTHER CHANGED IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRM’S MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRM’S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE RETAINED CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIRM’S LOAN ASSETS TO REFLECT PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SIMILARLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS ESTABLISHED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS. THE DETERMINATION OF EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ON A NUMBER OF MATTERS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

284–287

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS IS GENERALLY MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE IMPAIRED LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. ESTIMATING THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AS THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FURTHER RELY UPON ESTIMATES SUCH AS REDEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE, IN TURN, DEPENDENT ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICES, THE DURATION OF CURRENT OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC AND PORTFOLIO-SPECIFIC FACTORS. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT - CONSUMER LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL CREDIT LOSS FACTORS TO OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OVER AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD REPRESENTS THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATE AT WHICH THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THAT LOSS (THROUGH A CHARGE-OFF). ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS MAY VARY BY PRODUCT AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME; MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS, USING AVAILABLE CREDIT INFORMATION AND TRENDS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORY, USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT USES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATE.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THEN ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT THAT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION; THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, BORROWER BEHAVIOR, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PAYMENT RECASTS WITHIN THE HELOC PORTFOLIO, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE FACTORS CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PERFORMANCE OF A HELOC THAT EXPERIENCES A PAYMENT RECAST MAY BE AFFECTED BY BOTH THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS APPLIED IN ORIGINATING THE LOAN AND THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE PAYMENT RECAST. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS INTO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND EMPHASIZING ONE INPUT OR ASSUMPTION OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING OTHER INPUTS OR ASSUMPTIONS, COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

OVERALL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT (E.G., UNEMPLOYMENT RATES), DELINQUENCY RATES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL (E.G.,

174

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

HOUSING PRICES), FICO SCORES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. WHILE ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE LEVELS, CHANGES IN THE VARIOUS FACTORS MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME OR AT THE SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE OTHER. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES OR BOTH.

PCI LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN PCI LOANS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON QUARTERLY ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS.

THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICE DECLINES, AND THE DURATION OF CURRENT OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT - WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REQUIRES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. THE FIRM USES A RISK-RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS. WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRM’S OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE PARTICULAR SOURCE OF EXTERNAL DATA USED AS WELL AS THE TIME PERIOD TO WHICH LOSS DATA RELATES (FOR EXAMPLE, POINT-IN-TIME LOSS ESTIMATES AND ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT LONGER VIEWS OF THE CREDIT CYCLE). FINALLY, DIFFERENCES IN LOAN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN THE FIRM’S SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THOSE REFLECTED IN THE EXTERNAL DATA COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SENSITIVITY

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS SENSITIVE TO NUMEROUS FACTORS, DEPENDING ON THE PORTFOLIO. CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR IN THE FIRM’S ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT ITS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERIORATION IN THE FOLLOWING INPUTS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE FIRM’S MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES AS OF

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE PURPOSE OF THESE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE ISOLATED IMPACTS OF HYPOTHETICAL ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ON MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES. THE CHANGES IN THE INPUTS PRESENTED ABOVE ARE NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION OF THOSE RISK FACTORS.

THESE ANALYSES ARE NOT INTENDED TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY THE JUDGMENT MANAGEMENT APPLIES TO THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY AND IMPRECISION OF THESE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES BASED ON THEN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SPECIFIC FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF FACTORS AND INPUTS IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS AND INPUTS MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME RATE AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES, AND CHANGES IN FACTORS MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT, SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN OTHER FACTORS. IN ADDITION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW CHANGES IN SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT BORROWER BEHAVIOR OR OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN EVALUATING THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO ITS LOANS, INCLUDING RISK RATINGS, HOME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS, AND CREDIT CARD LOSS ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSS IS APPROPRIATE.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS, WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.

VALUATION

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE; FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR AN INSTRUMENT OR A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT, FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS MATURITY) AND USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS.

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM. FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

176

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INPUTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS — INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM’S CREDIT-WORTHINESS, LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED THE FVA FRAMEWORK TO INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF FUNDING INTO ITS VALUATION ESTIMATES FOR OTC DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES, REFLECTING AN INDUSTRY MIGRATION TOWARDS INCORPORATING THE MARKET COST OF UNSECURED FUNDING IN THE VALUATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FVA FRAMEWORK REQUIRED A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS INCLUDING: (I) DETERMINING WHEN THE ACCUMULATION OF MARKET EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMPELLING TO IMPLEMENT THE FVA FRAMEWORK; (II) ESTIMATING THE MARKET CLEARING PRICE FOR FUNDING IN THE RELEVANT MARKET; AND (III) DETERMINING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN DVA AND FVA, GIVEN THAT DVA ALREADY REFLECTS CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH ARE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF FUNDING SPREADS THAT DRIVE FVA.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS APPLIED BY THE FIRM, INCLUDING FVA, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS DIFFERENT THAN THOSE USED BY THE FIRM COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS AND HIERARCHY, AND ITS DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER U.S. GAAP, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE FIRM’S PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY USED TO CONDUCT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES

299–304

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ESTIMATES OF (A) THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK ACT , (B) LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES AND (C) THE RELEVANT COST OF EQUITY. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS.

BASED UPON THE UPDATED VALUATIONS FOR ALL OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DURING 2013. THE FAIR VALUES OF ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES AND DID NOT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND VALUATIONS. FOR THOSE REPORTING UNITS WHERE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED CARRYING VALUE, THE EXCESS FAIR VALUE AS A PERCENT OF CARRYING VALUE RANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY 15% TO 180%.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS WITHIN CCB DID NOT EXCEED ITS CARRYING VALUE. WHILE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL REMAINS AT AN ELEVATED RISK FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO ITS EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION OF THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE: (A) ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR THE BUSINESS (WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCES, NET INTEREST MARGIN, OPERATING EXPENSE, CREDIT LOSSES AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MEET REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS), AND (B) THE COST OF EQUITY USED TO DISCOUNT THOSE CASH FLOWS TO A PRESENT VALUE. EACH OF THESE FACTORS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE AND MOST CURRENT PROJECTIONS, INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, DERIVED FROM THE FIRM’S BUSINESS FORECASTING PROCESS AS REVIEWED WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THE PROJECTIONS FOR ALL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SHORT-TERM ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK ON PAGES

68–69

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, AND, IN THE LONGER TERM, INCORPORATE A SET OF MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND THE FIRM’S BEST ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH AND RETURNS OF ITS BUSINESSES. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES THIRD-PARTY AND PEER DATA TO BENCHMARK ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS, INCREASED ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS OF RECENT REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, OR ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN PROJECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BEYOND MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS, SUCH DECLINES COULD RESULT FROM INCREASES IN PRIMARY MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES, LOWER MORTGAGE ORIGINATION VOLUME, HIGHER COSTS TO RESOLVE FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS OR FROM DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING DECREASES IN HOME PRICES BEYOND MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. DECLINES IN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, INCREASES IN EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY, COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS, AS WELL AS MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN ITEMS MAY AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND EXAMINATION BY THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FIRM OPERATES, AND DISPUTES MAY OCCUR REGARDING ITS VIEW ON A TAX POSITION. THESE DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED BY AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OR ADJUDICATION IN THE COURT SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS WHETHER IT MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS, AND THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS, LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVISIONS IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

THE FIRM’S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPOSED OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES. DEFERRED TAXES ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING VERSUS INCOME TAX RETURN PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IF, IN MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT, THEIR REALIZABILITY IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THE FIRM PERFORMS REGULAR REVIEWS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH ALSO INCORPORATES VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING STRATEGIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSSES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REVIEWS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT REALIZABLE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REVERSED IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD IF THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT, BASED ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OR CHANGES IN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BECOME REALIZABLE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN A FUTURE PERIOD IF SUCH CHANGES WERE TO OCCUR.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD ARE MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE. AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REASSESSMENT OCCURS.

THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE ONLY AFFECTED THE PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES OF ANY RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

IN JUNE 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT CLARIFIES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN INVESTMENT COMPANY AND REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES. UNDER THE GUIDANCE, A COMPANY REGULATED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF

1940 IS CONSIDERED AN INVESTMENT COMPANY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ALL OTHER COMPANIES MUST MEET ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS DESCRIBED IN THE GUIDANCE AND CONSIDER OTHER TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS TO QUALIFY AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY. AN INVESTMENT COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY IS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES, IF ANY, IN A COMPANY’S STATUS AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, AND INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED OR CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED BY AN INVESTMENT COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS INVESTEES. THE GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INCLUSION OF THE FED FUNDS EFFECTIVE SWAP RATE

IN JULY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE ACCEPTABLE U.S. BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING INVOLVING INTEREST RATE RISK. IN ADDITION TO INTEREST RATES ON DIRECT U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS AND THE LIBOR SWAP RATE, THE GUIDANCE ALSO PERMITS THE OVERNIGHT INDEXED SWAP RATE (“OIS”) TO BE DESIGNATED AS A BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THE AMENDMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR QUALIFYING NEW OR REDESIGNATED HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS ENTERED INTO ON OR AFTER JULY 17, 2013. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE HEDGES, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INVESTMENTS IN QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS

IN JANUARY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT QUALIFY FOR THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. THE GUIDANCE REPLACES THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD AND ALLOWS COMPANIES TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO AMORTIZE THE COST OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN PROPORTION TO THE TAX BENEFITS RECEIVED IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET, AND PRESENT THE AMORTIZATION AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THIS GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“

JPMORGAN CHASE

” OR THE “FIRM”) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE FRAMEWORK IN “INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)” PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE “COSO” CRITERIA.

BASED UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO 1992 CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO..

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE “FIRM”)

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND 2012 AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE FIRM MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING”. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“

JPMORGAN CHASE

” OR THE “FIRM”), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“U.S.”), WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 33 ON PAGES

334–337

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (“VIE”).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AND PROVIDE THE EQUITY INVESTORS VOTING RIGHTS THAT ENABLE THEM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS. FOR THESE TYPES OF ENTITIES, THE FIRM’S DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS HELD. ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITIES’ VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS, OR THROUGH OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE THE FIRM CONTROL, ARE CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS (BUT DOES NOT OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR (I) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (WHICH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO RECOGNIZE ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITY’S NET EARNINGS), OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

CERTAIN FIRM-SPONSORED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES. FOR MANY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE FIRM IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER, BUT THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER WITHOUT CAUSE

(I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS), BASED ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE, OR THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NONAFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUT OR PARTICIPATING RIGHTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE FUNDS.

THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLICLY-HELD AND PRIVATELY-HELD ENTITIES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES AND ACCORDINGLY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTERESTS HELD, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, AND ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT, BY DESIGN, EITHER (1) LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2) HAVE EQUITY INVESTORS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS, OR DO NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE EXPECTED LOSSES, OR DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY.

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (“SPE”). SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPE’S INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPE’S ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE (I.E., THE PARTY THAT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST) IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS THE PARTY THAT HAS BOTH (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND (2) THROUGH ITS INTERESTS IN THE VIE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ITS ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE VIE AND ITS ONGOING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDES, FIRST, IDENTIFYING THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND SECOND, IDENTIFYING WHICH PARTY, IF ANY, HAS POWER OVER THOSE ACTIVITIES. IN GENERAL, THE PARTIES THAT MAKE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE VIE (SUCH AS ASSET

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

189

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGERS, COLLATERAL MANAGERS, SERVICERS, OR OWNERS OF CALL OPTIONS OR LIQUIDATION RIGHTS OVER THE VIE’S ASSETS) OR HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY REMOVE THOSE DECISION-MAKERS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SERVICING FEES, AND DERIVATIVE OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THE VIE. THIS ASSESSMENT REQUIRES THAT THE FIRM APPLY JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THESE INTERESTS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ARE CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDE: THE DESIGN OF THE VIE, INCLUDING ITS CAPITALIZATION STRUCTURE; SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS; PAYMENT PRIORITY; RELATIVE SHARE OF INTERESTS HELD ACROSS VARIOUS CLASSES WITHIN THE VIE’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE; AND THE REASONS WHY THE INTERESTS ARE HELD BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM PERFORMS ON-GOING REASSESSMENTS OF: (1) WHETHER ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED UNDER THE MAJORITY VOTING-INTEREST FRAMEWORK HAVE BECOME VIES, BASED ON CERTAIN EVENTS, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE VIE CONSOLIDATION FRAMEWORK; AND (2) WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING THE FIRM’S INVOLVEMENT WITH A VIE CAUSE THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATION CONCLUSION TO CHANGE.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (“FASB”) ISSUED AN AMENDMENT WHICH DEFERRED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR VIES FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS TO WHICH THE DEFERRAL APPLIES, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO APPLY OTHER EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH FUNDS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S. REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (“OCI”) WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

U.S. GAAP PERMITS ENTITIES TO PRESENT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON A NET BASIS ON THE BALANCE SHEET WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. U.S. GAAP ALSO PERMITS SECURITIES SOLD AND PURCHASED UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO BE PRESENTED NET WHEN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT. THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO NET SUCH BALANCES WHEN THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET.

THE FIRM USES MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED AGREEMENTS. A MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT IS A SINGLE CONTRACT WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT PERMITS MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THAT CONTRACT TO BE TERMINATED AND SETTLED THROUGH A SINGLE PAYMENT IN A SINGLE CURRENCY IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY, FAILURE TO MAKE A REQUIRED PAYMENT OR SECURITIES TRANSFER OR DELIVER COLLATERAL OR MARGIN WHEN DUE AFTER EXPIRATION OF ANY GRACE PERIOD). UPON THE EXERCISE OF TERMINATION RIGHTS BY THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY, (I) ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE TERMINATED, (II) ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE VALUED AND THE POSITIVE VALUE OR “IN THE MONEY” TRANSACTIONS ARE NETTED AGAINST THE NEGATIVE VALUE OR “OUT OF THE MONEY” TRANSACTIONS AND (III) THE ONLY REMAINING PAYMENT OBLIGATION IS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES TO PAY THE NETTED TERMINATION AMOUNT. UPON EXERCISE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES LOANED DEFAULT RIGHTS (I) ALL SECURITIES LOAN TRANSACTIONS ARE TERMINATED AND ACCELERATED, (II) ALL VALUES OF SECURITIES OR CASH HELD OR TO BE DELIVERED ARE CALCULATED, AND ALL SUCH SUMS ARE NETTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND (III) THE ONLY REMAINING PAYMENT OBLIGATION IS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES TO PAY THE NETTED TERMINATION AMOUNT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

TYPICAL MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS ALSO OFTEN CONTAIN A COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A SECURITY INTEREST IN OR TITLE TRANSFER OF SECURITIES OR CASH COLLATERAL/MARGIN TO THE PARTY THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND MARGIN (THE “DEMANDING PARTY”). THE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT TYPICALLY REQUIRES A PARTY TO TRANSFER COLLATERAL/MARGIN TO THE DEMANDING PARTY WITH A VALUE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE MARGIN DEFICIT ON A NET BASIS ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT, LESS ANY THRESHOLD. THE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT GRANTS TO THE DEMANDING PARTY, UPON DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY, THE RIGHT TO SET-OFF ANY AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY THE COUNTERPARTY AGAINST ANY POSTED COLLATERAL OR THE CASH EQUIVALENT OF ANY POSTED COLLATERAL/MARGIN. IT ALSO GRANTS TO THE DEMANDING PARTY THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AND TO APPLY THE PROCEEDS TO AN AMOUNT PAYABLE BY THE COUNTERPARTY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS (I.E., ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS). CERTAIN ASSETS (E.G., CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS, WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL), LIABILITIES AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS; THAT IS, THEY ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT).

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS MATURITY) AND USE AS INPUTS OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO THOSE USED BY THE FIRM COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION PROCESS

RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM’S VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION, WHICH IS PART OF THE FIRM’S FINANCE FUNCTION AND INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THESE ESTIMATES AND DETERMINING ANY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM’S POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS A FIRMWIDE VALUATION GOVERNANCE FORUM (“VGF”) COMPRISING SENIOR FINANCE AND RISK EXECUTIVES TO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM VALUATION ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED ACROSS THE FIRM. THE VGF IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRM-WIDE HEAD OF THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION, AND ALSO INCLUDES SUB-FORUMS FOR THE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK (“CIB”), MORTGAGE BANKING, (PART OF CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING) AND CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING TREASURY AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”).

THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION VERIFIES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES LEVERAGING INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED PRICES, VALUATION INPUTS AND OTHER MARKET DATA, WHERE AVAILABLE. WHERE INDEPENDENT PRICES OR INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, ADDITIONAL REVIEW IS PERFORMED BY THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION TO ENSURE THE REASONABLENESS OF ESTIMATES THAT CANNOT BE VERIFIED TO EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT DATA, AND MAY INCLUDE: EVALUATING THE LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY INCLUDING CLIENT UNWINDS; BENCHMARKING OF VALUATION INPUTS TO THOSE FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS; DECOMPOSING THE VALUATION OF STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS; COMPARING EXPECTED TO ACTUAL CASH FLOWS; REVIEWING PROFIT AND LOSS TRENDS; AND REVIEWING TRENDS IN COLLATERAL VALUATION. IN ADDITION THERE ARE ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT OR COMPLEX POSITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

195

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION DETERMINES ANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO THE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS. NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY (SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY). FOR OTHER POSITIONS, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND, FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE DETERMINATION OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS FOLLOWS A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS THE FIRM.

•

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN AN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE) MARKET. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE BASED ON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT INCLUDE: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTES OR ALTERNATIVELY PRICING POINTS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

THE FIRM MANAGES CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON THE BASIS OF NET OPEN RISK EXPOSURE AND, AS PERMITTED BY US GAAP, HAS ELECTED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH PORTFOLIOS ON THE BASIS OF A TRANSFER OF THE ENTIRE NET OPEN RISK POSITION IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION. WHERE THIS IS THE CASE, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING A LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. WHERE APPLIED, SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE BASED ON FACTORS THAT A RELEVANT MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN THE TRANSFER OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION TO A NORMAL MARKET-SIZE.

•

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT INCORPORATE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS – THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE VALUATION ESTIMATE PROVIDED BY THE MODEL.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM ALSO APPLIES ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRM’S OWN CREDITWORTHINESS, APPLYING A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS THE FIRM. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SUCH ADJUSTMENTS SEE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS ON PAGE

212

OF THIS NOTE

IMPACT OF FUNDING ON VALUATION ESTIMATES

THE FIRM INCORPORATES THE IMPACT OF FUNDING IN ITS VALUATION ESTIMATES WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET WOULD INCORPORATE IT IN A TRANSFER OF THE INSTRUMENT. AS A RESULT, THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES IS ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE RELEVANT OVERNIGHT INDEXED SWAP (“OIS”) RATE GIVEN THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTERPARTY. PRIOR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM DID NOT INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF FUNDING IN ITS VALUATION OF UNCOLLATERALIZED (INCLUDING PARTIALLY COLLATERALIZED) DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES. HOWEVER, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED A FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (“FVA”) FRAMEWORK TO INCORPORATE ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FUNDING COST OR BENEFIT THAT A RELEVANT MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN THE TRANSFER OF AN OTC DERIVATIVE OR STRUCTURED NOTE. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM RECORDED A ONE TIME

$1.5 BILLION

LOSS IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE CIB.

THE FVA FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BUT THE ADJUSTMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER LARGELY RELATES TO UNCOLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES GIVEN THAT THE IMPACT OF THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF FUNDING COSTS, IS ALREADY INCORPORATED IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DVA.

VALUATION MODEL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

IF PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR AN INSTRUMENT OR A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT, FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING VALUATION MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION DATA SUCH AS MATURITY AND USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS. WHERE THIS IS THE CASE THE PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS APPLIED TO THE INPUTS TO THOSE MODELS.

THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK FUNCTION WITHIN THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT GROUP, WHICH IN TURN REPORTS TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, REVIEWS AND APPROVES VALUATION MODELS USED BY THE FIRM. MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODEL’S SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT INCLUDING WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF A PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT; THE SELECTION AND RELIABILITY OF MODEL INPUTS; CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS; THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY MODEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS; AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED FROM THE MARKET. WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES.

196

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NEW SIGNIFICANT VALUATION MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION EXCEPT WHERE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION PERFORMS AN ANNUAL FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK ASSESSMENT WHERE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER VALUATION MODELS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED AGAIN.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER U.S. GAAP FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.

•

LEVEL 1 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

•

LEVEL 2 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

•

LEVEL 3 – ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT’S CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

(C)

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. “MARKET” IS A TERM DEFINED IN U.S. GAAP AS NOT EXCEEDING FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL (“TRANSACTION COSTS”). TRANSACTION COSTS FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE EITHER NOT APPLICABLE OR IMMATERIAL TO THE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY. THEREFORE, MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. WHEN FAIR VALUE HEDGING HAS BEEN APPLIED (OR WHEN MARKET IS BELOW COST), THE CARRYING VALUE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE, BECAUSE UNDER FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE COST BASIS IS ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE INFORMATION, ALL PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EACH PERIOD PRESENTED.

(D)

BALANCES REFLECT THE REDUCTION OF SECURITIES OWNED (LONG POSITIONS) BY THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) WHEN THE LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS HAVE IDENTICAL COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM SECURITY IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES NUMBERS (“CUSIPS”).

(E)

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO NET DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PAID WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT REDUCE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BALANCES FOR THIS NETTING ADJUSTMENT, EITHER WITHIN OR ACROSS THE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS SUCH NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY. THEREFORE, THE BALANCES REPORTED IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TABLE ARE GROSS OF ANY COUNTERPARTY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES BALANCES WOULD BE

$7.6 BILLION

AND

$7.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY; THIS IS EXCLUSIVE OF THE NETTING BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH CASH COLLATERAL, WHICH WOULD FURTHER REDUCE THE LEVEL 3 BALANCES.

(F)

PRIVATE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY LINE OF BUSINESS. THE COST BASIS OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED

$8.0 BILLION

AND

$8.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

(G)

INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, REAL ESTATE AND OTHER FUNDS THAT DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES. THE FIRM USES NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE WHEN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS WERE

$3.2 BILLION

AND

$4.9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH

$899 MILLION

ALL TRANSFERS ARE ASSUMED TO OCCUR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTERLY REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

DURING 2012 THE LIQUIDITY FOR CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS INCREASED AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY IMPROVED. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM INCORPORATED A REVISED VALUATION MODEL INTO ITS VALUATION PROCESS FOR CLOS TO BETTER CALIBRATE TO MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE. THE FIRM BEGAN TO VERIFY FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FROM THIS MODEL TO INDEPENDENT SOURCES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. ALTHOUGH MARKET LIQUIDITY AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY HAVE IMPROVED, CLO MARKET PRICES WERE NOT YET CONSIDERED MATERIALLY OBSERVABLE AND THEREFORE CLOS REMAINED IN LEVEL 3 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE CHANGE IN THE VALUATION PROCESS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S CLO POSITIONS. AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED, A PORTION OF THE CLOS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE REVISED VALUATION MODEL (NAMELY CERTAIN HIGHLY RATED CLOS) WERE TRANSFERRED FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING FOR INSTRUMENTS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS AND A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE PAGES

196–200

OF THIS NOTE.

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM. FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS — INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEED, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES.

FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM’S CREDITWORTHINESS, THE IMPACT OF FUNDING, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, WHERE RELEVANT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRM’S PRIMARY LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR THOSE INPUTS AND, FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF SUCH INPUTS. WHILE THE DETERMINATION TO CLASSIFY AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3 IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES) IN

ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE COMPONENTS. THE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

THE RANGE OF VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST LEVEL INPUT USED TO VALUE THE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT/INSTRUMENT CLASSIFICATION. THE INPUT RANGE DOES NOT REFLECT THE LEVEL OF INPUT UNCERTAINTY; RATHER, IT IS DRIVEN BY THE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OPTION CONTRACTS MAY HAVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND VALUATION UNCERTAINTY, BUT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IMPLIED VOLATILITY LEVELS BECAUSE THE OPTION CONTRACTS HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYINGS, TENORS, OR STRIKE PRICES.

WHERE PROVIDED, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THE INPUT VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS THAT THE INPUT IS BEING USED TO VALUE. IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE INPUT RANGE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUE DO NOT REFLECT THE DEGREE OF INPUT UNCERTAINTY OR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. RATHER, THEY REFLECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM AND THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS. THE INPUT RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUES WILL THEREFORE VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND PARAMETER TO PARAMETER BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE.

FOR THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE EQUITY AND INTEREST RATE CORRELATION INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED, WHILE THE CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE RANGE PRESENTED AND THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CORRELATION INPUTS WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED, WHILE EQUITY VOLATILITIES WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE. THE FORWARD COMMODITY PRICES USED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY DERIVATIVES WERE CONCENTRATED WITHIN THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED.

CHANGES IN AND RANGES OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT ON A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF A CHANGE IN EACH UNOBSERVABLE INPUT IN ISOLATION, AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, WHERE RELEVANT AND SIGNIFICANT. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INPUTS MAY NOT BE INDEPENDENT AS A CHANGE IN ONE UNOBSERVABLE INPUT MAY GIVE RISE TO A CHANGE IN ANOTHER UNOBSERVABLE INPUT, AND WHERE RELATIONSHIPS EXIST BETWEEN TWO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. RELATIONSHIPS MAY ALSO EXIST BETWEEN OBSERVABLE AND UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (FOR EXAMPLE, AS OBSERVABLE INTEREST RATES RISE, UNOBSERVABLE PREPAYMENT RATES DECLINE). SUCH RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW. IN ADDITION, FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WOULD ALSO GENERALLY APPLY.

IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AND EXTERNAL MARKET FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RANGE OF INPUTS USED IN THE VALUATION OF THE FIRM’S POSITIONS.

YIELD – THE YIELD OF AN ASSET IS THE INTEREST RATE USED TO DISCOUNT FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. AN INCREASE IN THE YIELD, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CREDIT SPREAD – THE CREDIT SPREAD IS THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL ANNUALIZED RETURN OVER THE MARKET INTEREST RATE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD DEMAND FOR TAKING EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF AN INSTRUMENT. THE CREDIT SPREAD FOR AN INSTRUMENT FORMS PART OF THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. GENERALLY, AN INCREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE YIELD AND THE CREDIT SPREAD OF A PARTICULAR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY PRIMARILY REFLECT THE RISK INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT. THE YIELD IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF THE COUPON PAID BY THE INSTRUMENT (WHICH MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK). THEREFORE, THE RANGE OF YIELD AND CREDIT SPREADS REFLECTS THE RANGE OF RISK INHERENT IN VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY THE FIRM. THE RISK INHERENT IN MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IS DRIVEN BY THE SUBORDINATION OF THE SECURITY BEING VALUED AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES WITHIN THE COLLATERALIZED POOL, INCLUDING BORROWER FICO SCORES, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND THE NATURE OF THE PROPERTY AND/OR ANY TENANTS FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. FOR CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, CREDIT SPREADS REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE OBLIGOR AND THE TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION.

PREPAYMENT SPEED – THE PREPAYMENT SPEED IS A MEASURE OF THE VOLUNTARY UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF A PREPAYABLE OBLIGATION IN A COLLATERALIZED POOL. PREPAYMENT SPEEDS GENERALLY DECLINE AS BORROWER DELINQUENCIES RISE. AN INCREASE IN PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A PREMIUM TO PAR AND AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A DISCOUNT TO PAR.

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS MAY VARY FROM COLLATERAL POOL TO COLLATERAL POOL, AND ARE DRIVEN BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF THE UNDERLYING BORROWER, THE REMAINING TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE LEVEL AND TYPE (E.G., FIXED OR FLOATING) OF INTEREST RATE BEING PAID BY THE BORROWER. TYPICALLY COLLATERAL POOLS WITH HIGHER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY HAVE A HIGHER PREPAYMENT RATE THAN THOSE WITH LOWER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY, ALL OTHER FACTORS BEING EQUAL.

CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE – THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE IS A MEASURE OF THE REDUCTION IN THE OUTSTANDING COLLATERAL BALANCE UNDERLYING A COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATION AS A RESULT OF DEFAULTS. WHILE THERE IS TYPICALLY NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL HAVE HIGH PREPAYMENT SPEEDS WILL TEND TO HAVE LOWER CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES WOULD GENERALLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY AND AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS. AN INCREASE IN THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING A SECURITIZATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION ITSELF. BASED ON THE TYPES OF SECURITIES OWNED IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS, CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES ARE MOST TYPICALLY AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED.

LOSS SEVERITY – THE LOSS SEVERITY (THE INVERSE CONCEPT IS THE RECOVERY RATE) IS THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FUTURE REALIZED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE ULTIMATE LIQUIDATION OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, EXPRESSED AS THE NET AMOUNT OF LOSS RELATIVE TO THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE. AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY IS GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN THE LOSS SEVERITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LOSS SEVERITY APPLIED IN VALUING A MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY INVESTMENT DEPENDS ON A HOST OF FACTORS RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES. THIS INCLUDES THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO, THE NATURE OF THE LENDER’S CHARGE OVER THE PROPERTY AND VARIOUS OTHER INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

206

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

CORRELATION – CORRELATION IS A MEASURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF TWO VARIABLES (E.G., HOW THE CHANGE IN ONE VARIABLE INFLUENCES THE CHANGE IN THE OTHER). CORRELATION IS A PRICING INPUT FOR A DERIVATIVE PRODUCT WHERE THE PAYOFF IS DRIVEN BY ONE OR MORE UNDERLYING RISKS. CORRELATION INPUTS ARE RELATED TO THE TYPE OF DERIVATIVE (E.G., INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, EQUITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE) DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. GIVEN A SHORT CORRELATION POSITION, AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. CORRELATION INPUTS BETWEEN RISKS WITHIN THE SAME ASSET CLASS ARE GENERALLY NARROWER THAN THOSE BETWEEN UNDERLYING RISKS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, THE RANGES OF CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS TEND TO BE NARROWER THAN THOSE AFFECTING OTHER ASSET CLASSES.

THE LEVEL OF CORRELATION USED IN THE VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES WITH MULTIPLE UNDERLYING RISKS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THOSE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THAT BETWEEN TWO INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES. SIMILARLY, THE TENOR OF THE TRANSACTION MAY ALSO IMPACT THE CORRELATION INPUT AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING RISKS MAY BE DIFFERENT OVER DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. FURTHERMORE, CORRELATION LEVELS ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COULD HAVE A RELATIVELY WIDE RANGE OF LEVELS WITHIN OR ACROSS ASSET CLASSES OVER TIME, PARTICULARLY IN VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

VOLATILITY – VOLATILITY IS A MEASURE OF THE VARIABILITY IN POSSIBLE RETURNS FOR AN INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR MARKET INDEX GIVEN HOW MUCH THE PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR INDEX CHANGES IN VALUE OVER TIME. VOLATILITY IS A PRICING INPUT FOR OPTIONS, INCLUDING EQUITY OPTIONS, COMMODITY OPTIONS, AND INTEREST RATE OPTIONS. GENERALLY, THE HIGHER THE VOLATILITY OF THE UNDERLYING, THE RISKIER THE INSTRUMENT. GIVEN A LONG POSITION IN AN OPTION, AN INCREASE IN VOLATILITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LEVEL OF VOLATILITY USED IN THE VALUATION OF A PARTICULAR OPTION-BASED DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE RISK UNDERLYING THE OPTION (E.G., THE VOLATILITY OF A PARTICULAR EQUITY SECURITY MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A PARTICULAR COMMODITY INDEX), THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVE AS WELL AS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE OPTION.

EBITDA MULTIPLE – EBITDA MULTIPLES REFER TO THE INPUT (OFTEN DERIVED FROM THE VALUE OF A COMPARABLE COMPANY) THAT IS MULTIPLIED BY THE HISTORIC AND/OR EXPECTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (“EBITDA”) OF A COMPANY IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COMPANY’S VALUE. AN INCREASE IN THE EBITDA MULTIPLE, IN ISOLATION, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS, WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

NET ASSET VALUE – NET ASSET VALUE IS THE TOTAL VALUE OF A FUND’S ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES. AN INCREASE IN NET ASSET VALUE WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A ROLLFORWARD OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE) FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY THE FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

AND

2011

. WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE DETERMINATION IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO, THE FIRM RISK-MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY; AS THESE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES DO NOT REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO SUCH LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS.

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INSTRUMENT, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRM’S OWN CREDITWORTHINESS.

•

CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“CVA”) ARE TAKEN TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY IN THE VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES. CVA ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY VALUED USING MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. AN ADJUSTMENT THEREFORE MAY BE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES DERIVATIVES CVA USING A SCENARIO ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED CREDIT EXPOSURE ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRM’S POSITIONS WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY, AND THEN ESTIMATES LOSSES AS A RESULT OF A COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EVENT. THE KEY INPUTS TO THIS METHODOLOGY ARE (I) THE EXPECTED POSITIVE EXPOSURE TO EACH COUNTERPARTY BASED ON A SIMULATION THAT ASSUMES THE CURRENT POPULATION OF EXISTING DERIVATIVES WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY REMAINS UNCHANGED AND CONSIDERS CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE FIRM’S CREDIT EXPOSURE, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF OFFSET; (II) THE PROBABILITY OF A DEFAULT EVENT OCCURRING FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY, AS DERIVED FROM OBSERVED OR ESTIMATED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (“CDS”) SPREADS; AND (III) ESTIMATED RECOVERY RATES IMPLIED BY CDS, ADJUSTED TO CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES IN RECOVERY RATES AS A DERIVATIVE CREDITOR RELATIVE TO THOSE REFLECTED IN CDS SPREADS, WHICH GENERALLY REFLECT SENIOR UNSECURED CREDITOR RISK.

•

DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) ARE TAKEN TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE DVA CALCULATION METHODOLOGY IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE CVA METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED ABOVE AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED THROUGH THE CDS MARKET TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF A SYSTEMIC EVENT AFFECTING THE FIRM. STRUCTURED NOTES DVA IS ESTIMATED USING THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE STRUCTURED NOTE AS THE EXPOSURE AMOUNT, AND IS OTHERWISE CONSISTENT WITH THE DERIVATIVE DVA METHODOLOGY.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED THE FVA FRAMEWORK TO INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF FUNDING INTO ITS VALUATION ESTIMATES FOR OTC DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES. THE FIRM’S FVA FRAMEWORK LEVERAGES ITS EXISTING CVA AND DVA CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES, AND THE KEY INPUTS ARE: (I) THE EXPECTED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM THE FIRM’S POSITIONS WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS; (II) FOR ASSETS, THE ESTIMATED MARKET FUNDING COST IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET; AND (III) FOR LIABILITIES, THE HYPOTHETICAL MARKET FUNDING COST FOR A

TRANSFER TO A MARKET PARTICIPANT WITH SIMILAR CREDIT STANDING AS THE FIRM.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CREDIT AND FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY HEDGING ACTIVITY, REFLECTED WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF THE DATES INDICATED.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND 2012, ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WERE

$6.2 BILLION

AND

$5.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED PREDOMINANTLY OF LOANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013,

$339 MILLION

AND

$5.8 BILLION

OF THESE ASSETS WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012,

$667 MILLION

AND

$4.4 BILLION

OF THESE ASSETS WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, RESPECTIVELY. LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2,

AND 3.

OF THE

$6.2 BILLION

OF ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS,

$3.6 BILLION

RELATED TO TRADE FINANCE LOANS THAT WERE RECLASSIFIED TO HELD-FOR-SALE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 AND SUBJECT TO A LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT. THESE LOANS WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3, AS THEY ARE VALUED BASED ON THE INDICATIVE PRICING RECEIVED FROM EXTERNAL INVESTORS, WHICH RANGED FROM A SPREAD OF

30 BPS

TO

78 BPS

, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

60 BPS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS ALSO INCLUDED

$1.7 BILLION

RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (I.E., COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS AND OTHER LOANS CHARGED OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE). THESE AMOUNTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3, AS THEY ARE VALUED USING A BROKER’S PRICE OPINION AND DISCOUNTED BASED UPON THE FIRM’S EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES. THESE DISCOUNTS TO THE BROKER PRICE OPINIONS RANGED FROM

17%

TO

62%

, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

29%.

THE TOTAL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT THOSE DATES WERE LOSSES OF

$789 MILLION

,

$1.6 BILLION

AND

$2.2 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY; THESE LOSSES WERE PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS. THE CHANGES REPORTED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF CHARGE-OFFS RECOGNIZED ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGE

267

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS, AND OTHER LOANS WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (E.G., RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS CHARGED OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE), SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS; DEPOSITS WITH BANKS; FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD; SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE; COMMERCIAL PAPER; FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED; SECURITIES LOANED AND SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; ACCOUNTS PAYABLE; AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE; RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT PERMITTED.

CARRYING VALUE INCLUDES UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT OR PREMIUM.

(B)

FAIR VALUE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT INCORPORATES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE AND CONTRACTUAL FEES) AND OTHER KEY INPUTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, AND PRIMARY ORIGINATION OR SECONDARY MARKET SPREADS. FOR CERTAIN LOANS, THE FAIR VALUE IS MEASURED BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET OR LIABILITY IS THE RESULT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE AS COMPARED WITH CARRYING VALUE. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED FOR A FINANCIAL ASSET’S REMAINING LIFE IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT ARE ESTIMATED FOR A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS CALCULATION; FUTURE LOAN INCOME (INTEREST AND FEES) IS INCORPORATED IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT IS GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TRADING ASSETS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE (“LONG” POSITIONS) THAT ARE HELD FOR CLIENT MARKET-MAKING AND CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS FOR CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, CERTAIN LOANS MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS AND FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES

INVENTORIES THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET (MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE). TRADING LIABILITIES INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (“SHORT” POSITIONS). THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE INSTRUMENTS AT A FUTURE DATE TO COVER THE SHORT POSITIONS. INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES ARE THE REPORTED RECEIVABLES (UNREALIZED GAINS) AND PAYABLES (UNREALIZED LOSSES) RELATED TO DERIVATIVES. TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. BALANCES REFLECT THE REDUCTION OF SECURITIES OWNED (LONG POSITIONS) BY THE AMOUNT OF IDENTICAL SECURITIES SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS).

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ELECTION WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS DURING

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.

•

LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN VALUE ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION OF THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY

INFORMATION, WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.

•

LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREAD.

•

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 5 – CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE FIRM’S RISK APPETITE.

IN THE FIRM’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A KEY FOCUS ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL RISK CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LOANS SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY PARTICULAR LOAN PRODUCT (E.G., OPTION ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES (“ARMS”)), INDUSTRY SEGMENT (E.G., COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE) OR ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES REPRESENTING PRIMARILY MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE CLIENTS OF

$26.9 BILLION

AND

$23.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY, ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THESE MARGIN LOANS ARE GENERALLY OVER-COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF ASSETS MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS’ BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A MAINTENANCE MARGIN CALL IS MADE TO THE CLIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT, THE CLIENT’S POSITIONS MAY BE LIQUIDATED BY THE FIRM TO MEET THE MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES, THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT IMPAIRMENT ON THESE RECEIVABLES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO MODIFY OR MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS. COUNTERPARTIES TO A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT SEEK TO OBTAIN RISKS AND REWARDS SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM PURCHASING OR SELLING A RELATED CASH INSTRUMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXCHANGE UPFRONT THE FULL PURCHASE OR SALES PRICE. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO USES DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE ITS OWN RISK EXPOSURES. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING OR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

MARKET-MAKING DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES. CUSTOMERS USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR MODIFY INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISKS. THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS FROM ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO OTHER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS OR BY PURCHASING OR SELLING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET THE EXPOSURE FROM CLIENT DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM ALSO SEEKS TO EARN A SPREAD BETWEEN THE CLIENT DERIVATIVES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, AND FROM THE REMAINING OPEN RISK POSITIONS.

RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM MANAGES ITS MARKET RISK EXPOSURES USING VARIOUS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. SIMILARLY, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASES OR DECREASES AS A RESULT OF VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESETTING TO CURRENT MARKET RATES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE REPAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENT ORIGINATION OR ISSUANCE OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT CURRENT MARKET RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. THE FIRM GENERALLY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED (I.E., NON-U.S. DOLLAR) ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE U.S. DOLLAR–EQUIVALENT VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED REVENUE OR EXPENSE INCREASE OR DECREASE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

COMMODITIES CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET

THE DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION OF THE RELATED INVENTORY. ALSO IN THE COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND FORWARDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING AND LOAD-SERVING CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN THE ENTITY REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO PAY AN OBLIGATION WHEN DUE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES SECTION ON PAGES

231–233

OF THIS NOTE.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES GAINS AND LOSSES TABLE ON PAGE

231

OF THIS NOTE, AND THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING GAINS AND LOSSES TABLES ON PAGES

229–231

OF THIS NOTE.

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND SETTLEMENT TYPES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) DERIVATIVES, WHICH ARE NEGOTIATED AND SETTLED BILATERALLY WITH THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO, AS PRINCIPAL, CERTAIN EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVES (“ETD”) SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AND “CLEARED” OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC-CLEARED”) DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (“CCPS”). ETD CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY STANDARDIZED CONTRACTS TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE AND CLEARED BY THE CCP, WHICH IS THE COUNTERPARTY FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES ARE TRADED ON A BILATERAL BASIS AND THEN NOVATED TO THE CCP FOR CLEARING.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. FOR INFORMATION ON THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM CLEARS FOR ITS CLIENTS’ ACCOUNTS, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES

318–324

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM NETS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGES

189–191

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE REPORTED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. THE TABULAR DISCLOSURES ON PAGES

223–233

OF THIS NOTE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF, AND REPORTING FOR, DERIVATIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN STRUCTURED NOTES, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 ON PAGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES – GENERALLY INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. HOWEVER, JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO PURCHASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES. FOR THE SAME REASON, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ADDITION, FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY MUST BE DOCUMENTED. HEDGE DOCUMENTATION MUST IDENTIFY THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY OR FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND TYPE OF RISK TO BE HEDGED, AND HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DERIVATIVE IS ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR-VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A DERIVATIVE HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST QUARTERLY. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EXACTLY OFFSET THE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK) MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATIONS: FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. JPMORGAN CHASE USES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, AFS SECURITIES AND CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE, AND IN THE VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE HEDGED ITEM AND FOR INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES CASH FLOW HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN FORECASTED CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OCI AND RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, NONINTEREST REVENUE AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (“AOCI”) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED AFFECT EARNINGS. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO NOT OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL HEDGE FORECAST, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE VALUES RECORDED IN AOCI ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN AOCI.

(C)

NET AMOUNT REPRESENTS EXPOSURE OF COUNTERPARTIES TO THE FIRM.

LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS INTRODUCED BY EACH DERIVATIVE CONTRACT TYPE, DERIVATIVES EXPOSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO CREDIT RISK — THE RISK THAT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND THE COLLATERAL, IF ANY, HELD BY THE FIRM PROVES TO BE OF INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO COVER THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION. IT IS THE POLICY OF JPMORGAN CHASE TO ACTIVELY PURSUE, WHERE POSSIBLE, THE USE OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM.

WHILE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK, DERIVATIVE PAYABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO LIQUIDITY RISK, AS THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO POST CASH OR SECURITIES COLLATERAL WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE CONTRACTS MOVES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES’ FAVOR OR UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THE FIRM’S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES’ RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE PAYABLES RELATED TO OTC AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED UPON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, AND THE ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL THE FIRM HAS POSTED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-NOTCH AND TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF THE LONG-TERM ISSUER RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, PREDOMINANTLY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.”), AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RELATED TO OTC AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CONTINGENT COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED UPON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE. DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED OR TERMINATIONS TO BE TRIGGERED WHEN THE PREDEFINED THRESHOLD RATING IS BREACHED. A DOWNGRADE BY A SINGLE RATING AGENCY THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN A RATING LOWER THAN A PREEXISTING CORRESPONDING RATING PROVIDED BY ANOTHER MAJOR RATING AGENCY WILL GENERALLY NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES IN WHICH ADDITIONAL INITIAL MARGIN MAY BE REQUIRED UPON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, OR TERMINATION PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. THE LIQUIDITY IMPACT IN THE TABLE IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A DOWNGRADE BELOW THE LOWEST CURRENT RATING OF THE RATING AGENCIES REFERRED TO IN THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT.

THE FIRM MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AND USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NET OPEN RISK POSITIONS FROM THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THESE DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER DERIVATIVES (INCLUDING THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO ) THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING OR SPECIFIED RISK MANAGEMENT CATEGORIES ABOVE, ARE INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. SEE NOTE 7 ON PAGES

234–235

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR INFORMATION ON PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD-PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS THE PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY, A FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION OR A RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION BUT HAS THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT EVENT.

THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND USES THESE DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES. FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER, THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. SECOND, AS AN END-USER, THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, AND TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CERTAIN AFS SECURITIES AND FROM CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, SEE THE DISCUSSION ON PAGE

222

OF THIS NOTE. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (“SINGLE-NAME”) OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION ON BOTH SINGLE- NAME AND INDEX-REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS. SINGLE-NAME CDS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY, WHILE INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND OTHER MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX COMPRISES A PORTFOLIO OF CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE ENTITIES. NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE PERIODICALLY ESTABLISHED WITH A NEW UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX. CDS CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCE NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST

$1 MILLION

OF REALIZED CREDIT LOSSES IN A

$10 MILLION

PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE ENTITY. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE VALUE OF THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT SETTLEMENT OF THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER DOES NOT NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTES

A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE IS A FUNDED CREDIT DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE PURCHASES FROM THE NOTE INVESTOR CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCE ENTITY OR AN INDEX. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR PAYS THE ISSUER THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN RETURN, THE ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR, BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE REFERENCED ENTITY. THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT (OR ONE OF THE ENTITIES THAT MAKES UP A REFERENCE INDEX). IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS THE INVESTOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY TO THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE HAS RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT-RELATED NOTES, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

288–299

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CREDIT-RELATED NOTES THE FIRM SOLD AND PURCHASED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

. UPON A CREDIT EVENT, THE FIRM AS A SELLER OF PROTECTION WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE FULL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF NET PROTECTION SOLD, AS THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE CONTRACTS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. THE FIRM MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES. OTHER PURCHASED PROTECTION REFERENCED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, REFERENCE POSITIONS (INCLUDING INDICES, PORTFOLIO COVERAGE AND OTHER REFERENCE POINTS) AS WELL AS PROTECTION PURCHASED THROUGH CREDIT-RELATED NOTES.

232

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM DOES NOT USE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR SUCH DERIVATIVES, BECAUSE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, OR RELATED CASH INSTRUMENTS AND ECONOMIC HEDGES, EACH OF WHICH REDUCES, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 9 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRM’S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (“OPEB”) PLANS (COLLECTIVELY THE “PLANS”) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING

ONE YEAR

OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER

THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRM’S POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. THE FIRM DOES

NO

T ANTICIPATE AT THIS TIME ANY CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IN

2014

. THE

2014

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$49 MILLION

OF WHICH

$32 MILLION

ARE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EARNED PAY CREDITS ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN; NO FURTHER PAY CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED UNDER THIS PLAN. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN THE AMOUNT OF

$245 MILLION

AND

$276 MILLION

, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE MARCH 19, 2012, PURSUANT TO THE

WAMU GLOBAL SETTLEMENT,

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BECAME THE SPONSOR OF THE WAMU PENSION PLAN. THIS PLAN’S ASSETS WERE MERGED WITH AND INTO THE JPMORGAN CHASE RETIREMENT PLAN EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY PROVIDES TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE “401(K) SAVINGS PLAN”), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN.

THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO

5%

OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (E.G., BASE PAY) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A

ONE

-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF

$250,000

OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST AFTER

THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2009. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH THE LENGTH OF SERVICE AND THE DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRM’S SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (“COLI”) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

GAINS AND LOSSES

FOR THE FIRM’S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY

NINE YEARS

. IN ADDITION, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLAN WHEN THE PRIOR SERVICE COST IS FIRST RECOGNIZED. THE AVERAGE REMAINING AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CURRENT PRIOR SERVICE COSTS IS

SIX YEARS.

FOR THE FIRM’S OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A

FIVE

-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. THIS VALUE IS REFERRED TO AS THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES, ADJUSTED FOR GAINS AND LOSSES NOT YET RECOGNIZED, IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. ANY EXCESS NET GAIN OR LOSS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFETIME OF RETIRED PARTICIPANTS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

THIRTEEN YEARS

; HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS RESULTING FROM PLAN CHANGES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

TWO YEARS.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR’S PROJECTED LONG-TERM (

10 YEARS

OR MORE) RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO MIX OF EACH PLAN; AS A RESULT, IN

2013

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINED THE SAME EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. THE RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON “AA” RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS IS BASED ON AN IMPLIED YIELD FOR SIMILAR BONDS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLAN’S PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT THE

ONE

-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE “AA”

15

-YEAR-PLUS BOND INDEX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUALIZED ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PROJECTED AND ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS, FOR THE FIRM’S SIGNIFICANT U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, AS OF AND FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE FIRM INCREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY

$84 MILLION

FOR

2014

. THE

2014

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN ASSETS ARE

7.00%

AND

6.25%

, RESPECTIVELY. FOR 2014, THE INITIAL HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION HAS BEEN SET AT

6.50%

, AND THE ULTIMATE HEALTH CARE TREND ASSUMPTION AND THE YEAR TO REACH THE ULTIMATE RATE REMAINS AT

5.00%

AND

2017

, RESPECTIVELY, UNCHANGED FROM 2013. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION REMAINED AT

5.00%

WHILE THE ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE DECREASED TO

3.50%.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN AN AGGREGATE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$39 MILLION

IN

2014

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN

2014

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE

$26 MILLION

AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE

$254 MILLION

. A 25-BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

2014

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY

$32 MILLION

AND A

DECREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY

$130 MILLION

. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE

2014

NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY

$15 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (E.G., HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS). NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE ALSO INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRM’S COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN FUNDS INTENDED TO REPLICATE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDICES.

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS AND GOALS USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER. ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. PERIODICALLY THE FIRM PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS, INCORPORATING PROJECTED ASSET AND LIABILITY DATA, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION ON CUMULATIVE PENSION EXPENSE, ECONOMIC COST, PRESENT VALUE OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDED STATUS. AS THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS OVERFUNDED, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THIS PLAN WAS ADJUSTED IN 2013 TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER LIQUIDITY.

CURRENTLY, APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE: U.S. EQUITY

, INTERNATIONAL EQUITY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES WHILE MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PLAN. THE FIRM REGULARLY REVIEWS THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ASSET MANAGERS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITIES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY IN RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY PROFILES, THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS’ LARGEST ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE TO DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROPRIATE DURATIONS. OTHER ASSETS, MAINLY EQUITY SECURITIES, ARE THEN INVESTED FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT GROWTH. SIMILAR TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ASSET MANAGERS FOR THE U.K. PLANS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND THE PORTFOLIO IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PLANS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE, MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. EXPOSURE TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY THE BROAD DIVERSIFICATION OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INVESTMENTS IN EACH OF THE COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE FURTHER DIVERSIFIED INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM’S U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT THROUGH INDIRECT EXPOSURES THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS. THE PLANS HOLD INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE SPONSORED OR MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

$2.9 BILLION

AND

$1.8 BILLION

FOR U.S. PLANS AND

$242 MILLION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 10 – EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH WAS LAST AMENDED IN MAY 2011 (“LTIP”). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LTIP, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

266 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH MAY 2015. THE LTIP IS THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS. IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, THE LTIP, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE “LTI PLANS,” AND SUCH PLANS CONSTITUTE THE FIRM’S STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (“RSUS”) ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT UPON THEIR GRANT. GENERALLY, RSUS ARE GRANTED ANNUALLY AND VEST AT A RATE OF 50% AFTER

TWO YEARS

AND 50% AFTER

THREE YEARS

AND ARE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS OF THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION, RSUS TYPICALLY INCLUDE FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS BASED ON AGE OR SERVICE-RELATED REQUIREMENTS. ALL RSUS AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL VESTED AND CONTAIN CLAWBACK PROVISIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN CANCELLATION UNDER CERTAIN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. RSUS ENTITLE THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSUS ARE OUTSTANDING AND, AS SUCH, ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24 ON PAGE

311

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (“SARS”) HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE. THE FIRM TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR; THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY GRANTS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES. THE 2013, 2012 AND 2011 GRANTS OF SARS BECOME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER

FIVE YEARS

(I.E.,

20%

PER YEAR) AND CONTAIN CLAWBACK PROVISIONS SIMILAR TO RSUS. THE

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

GRANTS OF SARS CONTAIN FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS. SARS GENERALLY EXPIRE

TEN YEARS

AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. GENERALLY, FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR AWARDS WITH FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS AND AWARDS GRANTED WITH NO FUTURE SUBSTANTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENT, THE FIRM ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES AS OF THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEE’S FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRM’S POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. DURING

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO

2 MILLION

SARS. THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY AWARDED BY THE FIRM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT, WHILE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR VESTING OF THESE AWARDS HAVE BEEN MET, VESTING SHOULD BE DEFERRED FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO

18 MONTHS

(I.E., UP TO JULY 22, 2014), TO ENABLE THE FIRM TO MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST THE FIRM’S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND PERFORMANCE GOALS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION RELATING TO THE CIO MATTER. THE SARS, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2018, WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE NO EARLIER THAN JULY 22, 2014, AND HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$39.83

(THE PRICE OF JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT). VESTING WILL BE SUBJECT TO A BOARD DETERMINATION TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROGRESS AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS AS IT DEEMS RELEVANT. THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS AWARD IS DEPENDENT ON CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SARS THROUGH THE DATE WHEN THE VESTED NUMBER OF SARS ARE DETERMINED, IF ANY, AND THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH WAS INITIALLY ASSUMED TO BE

FIVE YEARS

BUT, EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO

SIX AND ONE-HALF YEARS

. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED

$14 MILLION

,

$5 MILLION

AND

$(4) MILLION

NOTE 12 – SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS, HELD-TO-MATURITY (“HTM”) OR TRADING. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES

195–215

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE FIRM’S AFS AND HTM INVESTMENT SECURITIES (THE “INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO”) IS HELD BY CIO IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE DEBT SECURITIES COMPRISING THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS

AA+

(BASED UPON EXTERNAL RATINGS WHERE AVAILABLE, AND WHERE NOT AVAILABLE, BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL RATINGS WHICH CORRESPOND TO RATINGS AS DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S). AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS). THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  HTM DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD UNTIL MATURITY, ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  FOR BOTH AFS AND HTM DEBT SECURITIES, PURCHASE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

AFS DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND HTM DEBT SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF THE FIRM’S ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (“OTTI”). FOR MOST TYPES OF DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. FOR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATIONS THAT ARE RATED BELOW “AA” AT THEIR ACQUISITION, OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRM WOULD NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED INVESTMENT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS AN OTTI TO HAVE OCCURRED WHEN THERE IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. FOR AFS EQUITY SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT RECOVER ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

POTENTIAL OTTI IS CONSIDERED USING A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; ADVERSE CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A SECURITY; PAYMENT STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY; CHANGES TO THE RATING OF THE SECURITY BY A RATING AGENCY; THE VOLATILITY OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES; AND THE FIRM’S INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY UNTIL RECOVERY.

FOR AFS DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES OTTI LOSSES IN EARNINGS IF THE FIRM HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY, OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES. FOR DEBT SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION, INCLUDING AFS SECURITIES THE FIRM HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE SECURITIES ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IN THE EVENT OF A CREDIT LOSS, ONLY THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. AMOUNTS RELATING TO FACTORS OTHER THAN CREDIT LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN OCI.

THE FIRM’S CASH FLOW EVALUATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND EXPECTATIONS OF RELEVANT MARKET AND ECONOMIC DATA AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. FOR SECURITIES ISSUED IN A SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CASH FLOWS CONSIDERING UNDERLYING LOAN-LEVEL DATA AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE SECURITIZATION, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, EXCESS SPREAD, OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, AND COMPARES THE LOSSES PROJECTED FOR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (“POOL LOSSES”) AGAINST THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE POOL LOSSES, OR WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. THE FIRM ALSO PERFORMS OTHER ANALYSES TO SUPPORT ITS CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, SUCH AS FIRST-LOSS ANALYSES OR STRESS SCENARIOS.

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OTTI LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IF THE FIRM INTENDS TO SELL THE SECURITY. IN OTHER CASES THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELEVANT FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE, AND WHETHER EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT A REALIZABLE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON AN EQUITY SECURITY IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 13 – SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, “SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS”) PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRM’S INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS, ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS’ FINANCING NEEDS, AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THE SECURITIES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED. SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. WHERE APPROPRIATE UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGES

189–191

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FEES RECEIVED AND PAID IN

CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES

215–218

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND SECURITIES BORROWED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, FOR AGREEMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE GROSS AND NET SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED. SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS NET OF SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHERE THE FIRM HAS OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE LEGAL OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT, AND WHERE THE OTHER RELEVANT CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. WHERE SUCH A LEGAL OPINION HAS NOT BEEN EITHER SOUGHT OR OBTAINED, THE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR NETTING AND ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE TABLE BELOW.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S POLICY IS TO TAKE POSSESSION, WHERE POSSIBLE, OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND OF SECURITIES BORROWED. THE FIRM MONITORS THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES (PRIMARILY G7 GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES AND AGENCY MBS, AND EQUITIES) THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES AND EITHER REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR RETURNS A PORTION OF THE COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES. MARGIN LEVELS ARE ESTABLISHED INITIALLY BASED UPON THE COUNTERPARTY AND TYPE OF COLLATERAL AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO PROTECT AGAINST DECLINES IN COLLATERAL VALUE IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. JPMORGAN CHASE TYPICALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS RESALE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES BORROWED COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE PURCHASED OR BORROWED SECURITIES IN THE EVENT OF A CUSTOMER DEFAULT. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO RESALE AND SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT IMPAIRMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 – LOANS

LOAN ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENT’S STRATEGY FOR THE LOAN, AND ON WHETHER THE LOAN WAS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR LOANS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

•

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (I.E., “RETAINED”), OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (“PCI”) LOANS

•

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

•

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

•

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES A DETAILED ACCOUNTING DISCUSSION OF THESE LOAN CATEGORIES.

LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PCI LOANS)

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, ARE MEASURED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE FOLLOWING: ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; NET CHARGE-OFFS; INTEREST APPLIED TO PRINCIPAL (FOR LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD); UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS; AND NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS. CREDIT CARD LOANS ALSO INCLUDE BILLED FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

INTEREST INCOME

INTEREST INCOME ON PERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST. PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS, AS WELL AS NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN TO PRODUCE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CONSIDERED NONPERFORMING WHEN FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, WHICH FOR CONSUMER LOANS, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, GENERALLY OCCURS WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS

90 DAYS

OR MORE PAST DUE UNLESS THE LOAN IS BOTH WELL SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION. A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE PAST DUE WHEN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER BY THE CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED DUE DATE OR FOR CERTAIN LOANS (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS), WHEN A MONTHLY PAYMENT IS DUE AND UNPAID FOR

30 DAYS

OR MORE. CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOANS THAT ARE LESS THAN

90 DAYS

PAST DUE MAY BE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN DOUBT (E.G., PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO NONPERFORMING SENIOR LIENS). FINALLY, COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE TYPICALLY MAINTAINED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS.

ON THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALL INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED (I.E., ON A CASH BASIS) IF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE IS DEEMED FULLY COLLECTIBLE; HOWEVER, IF THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE, ALL INTEREST CASH RECEIPTS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOAN (THE COST RECOVERY METHOD). FOR CONSUMER LOANS, APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY TYPICALLY RESULTS IN THE FIRM RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS ON A CASH BASIS.

A LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THERE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN.

AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS; ACCORDINGLY, INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. HOWEVER, THE FIRM SEPARATELY ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME ON CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WITH A CHARGE TO INTEREST INCOME AND IS REPORTED AS AN OFFSET TO LOANS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT LOAN PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

284–287

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTING POLICES FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CHARGE-OFFS

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING, RISK-RATED AUTO AND PCI LOANS, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF OR CHARGED DOWN TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (I.E., FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL), WITH AN OFFSET TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (“FFIEC”). RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, NON-MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF AT

180 DAYS

PAST DUE. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2012

, THE FIRM REVISED ITS POLICY TO CHARGE-OFF MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS AT

120 DAYS

PAST DUE RATHER THAN

180 DAYS

PAST DUE. AUTO AND STUDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF NO LATER THAN

120 DAYS

PAST DUE.

258

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS WILL BE CHARGED OFF EARLIER THAN THE FFIEC CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOLLOWS.

•

A CHARGE-OFF IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A LOAN IS MODIFIED IN A TDR IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. A LOAN IS CONSIDERED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT WHEN REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, RATHER THAN BY CASH FLOWS FROM THE BORROWER’S OPERATIONS, INCOME OR OTHER RESOURCES.

•

LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED AN EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY) THAT SUGGESTS A LOSS IS EITHER KNOWN OR HIGHLY CERTAIN ARE SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

60 DAYS

PAST DUE, OR SOONER IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. CREDIT CARD AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WITHIN

60 DAYS

OF RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OR OTHER EVENT. STUDENT LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

60 DAYS

PAST DUE AFTER RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF A BANKRUPTCY.

•

AUTO LOANS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE UPON REPOSSESSION OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND AFTER A REDEMPTION PERIOD (I.E., THE PERIOD DURING WHICH A BORROWER MAY CURE THE LOAN) HAS PASSED.

OTHER THAN IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGE-OFFS ON GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS, RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND RISK-RATED AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE BOTH IMPAIRED AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE A CHARGE-OFF INCLUDES MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRM’S CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN AND VALUATION OF THE BORROWER’S EQUITY OR THE LOAN COLLATERAL.

WHEN A LOAN IS CHARGED DOWN TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL (E.G., SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE). IN CASES WHERE THE COLLATERAL IS IN THE FORM OF LIQUID SECURITIES, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR BROKER QUOTES. FOR ILLIQUID SECURITIES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL.

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. WHEN IT BECOMES LIKELY THAT A BORROWER IS EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY, THE FIRM OBTAINS A BROKER’S PRICE OPINION OF THE HOME BASED ON AN EXTERIOR-ONLY VALUATION (“EXTERIOR OPINIONS”), WHICH IS THEN UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY

SIX MONTHS

THEREAFTER. AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE FIRM RECEIVES THE PROPERTY IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION), GENERALLY, EITHER THROUGH FORECLOSURE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER, THE FIRM OBTAINS AN APPRAISAL BASED ON AN INSPECTION THAT INCLUDES THE INTERIOR OF THE HOME (“INTERIOR APPRAISALS”). EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS ARE DISCOUNTED BASED UPON THE FIRM’S EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES AS COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATED VALUES PROVIDED BY EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS, CONSIDERING STATE- AND PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON APPRAISALS FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. COLLATERAL VALUES ARE TYPICALLY UPDATED EVERY

SIX

TO

TWELVE MONTHS

, EITHER BY OBTAINING A NEW APPRAISAL OR BY PERFORMING AN INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S POLICIES. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS BOTH BORROWER- AND MARKET-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OBTAINING APPRAISAL UPDATES OR BROKER PRICE OPINIONS AT MORE FREQUENT INTERVALS.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. FOR CONSUMER LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON AN INDIVIDUAL LOAN BASIS.

INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST.

LOAN ORIGINATION FEES OR COSTS AND PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE DEFERRED IN A CONTRA LOAN ACCOUNT UNTIL THE RELATED LOAN IS SOLD. THE DEFERRED FEES AND DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASIS OF THE LOAN AND THEREFORE ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIODIC DETERMINATION OF THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND/OR THE GAIN OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NONACCRUAL POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BECAUSE HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

259

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

LOANS USED IN A MARKET-MAKING STRATEGY OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

FOR THESE LOANS, THE EARNED CURRENT CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAYMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST INCOME. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED UPFRONT IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE CATEGORY AS INCURRED.

BECAUSE THESE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM’S NONACCRUAL, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES

195–215

AND

215–218

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

PCI LOANS

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. PCI LOANS HAVE EVIDENCE OF CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE THE LOAN’S ORIGINATION DATE AND THEREFORE IT IS PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE COLLECTED. BECAUSE PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES, NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO PCI LOANS IS RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. SEE PAGE

274

OF THIS NOTE FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING FOR PCI LOANS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION.

LOAN CLASSIFICATION CHANGES

LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN THE EVENT THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN A LOAN IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO, THE LOAN IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

284–287

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

THE FIRM SEEKS TO MODIFY CERTAIN LOANS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THE MODIFICATION,

JPMORGAN CHASE

GRANTS ONE OR MORE CONCESSIONS TO A BORROWER WHO IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE FIRM’S ECONOMIC LOSS, AVOID FORECLOSURE OR REPOSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL, AND TO ULTIMATELY MAXIMIZE PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM FROM THE BORROWER. THE CONCESSIONS GRANTED VARY BY PROGRAM AND BY BORROWER-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM EXTENSIONS, PAYMENT DEFERRALS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF EQUITY OR OTHER ASSETS IN LIEU OF PAYMENTS.

SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (“TDRS”). A LOAN THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED UNTIL IT MATURES, IS REPAID, OR IS OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BORROWER PERFORMS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE MODIFIED LOAN IS AT OR ABOVE THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AT THE TIME OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ASSUMING THAT THE LOAN SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMS UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS AND THE FIRM EXPECTS TO COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS, THE LOAN IS DISCLOSED AS IMPAIRED AND AS A TDR ONLY DURING THE YEAR OF THE MODIFICATION; IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, THE LOAN IS NOT DISCLOSED AS AN IMPAIRED LOAN OR AS A TDR SO LONG AS REPAYMENT OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

LOANS, EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, MODIFIED IN A TDR ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES SUCH LOANS WERE ALREADY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. THESE LOANS MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS (THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS RESUMED) IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: (A) THE BORROWER HAS PERFORMED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS FOR A MINIMUM OF

SIX MONTHS

AND/OR

SIX

PAYMENTS, AND (B) THE FIRM HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE MODIFIED LOAN IS REASONABLY ASSURED BASED ON, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BORROWER’S DEBT CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF FUTURE EARNINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES, LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIOS, AND OTHER CURRENT MARKET CONSIDERATIONS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED AND WELL-DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE LOAN IS CURRENT AT THE MODIFICATION DATE, SUCH LOANS ARE NOT PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AT THE TIME OF MODIFICATION.

BECAUSE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THESE LOANS ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING THE FIRM’S ESTABLISHED ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY, WHICH CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES FOR THE MODIFIED LOANS. A LOAN MODIFIED IN A TDR REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY THROUGHOUT ITS REMAINING LIFE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOAN IS PERFORMING AND HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS AND/OR THE LOAN HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE IMPAIRED LOANS DISCLOSURES (I.E., LOANS RESTRUCTURED AT MARKET RATES). FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES. PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, LAND, AND BUILDINGS) AND COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (E.G., AUTOMOBILES, AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS).

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES FORECLOSED PROPERTY UPON RECEIVING ASSETS IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION). FOR LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL PROPERTY, THE FIRM GENERALLY RECOGNIZES THE ASSET RECEIVED AT FORECLOSURE SALE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF

FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER. FORECLOSED ASSETS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INITIALLY RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO FAIR VALUE ARE CHARGED/CREDITED TO NONINTEREST REVENUE. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE THE SAME SEGMENTS USED BY THE FIRM TO DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD; CREDIT CARD; AND WHOLESALE. WITHIN EACH PORTFOLIO SEGMENT, THE FIRM MONITORS AND ASSESSES THE CREDIT RISK IN THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF LOANS, BASED ON THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH LOAN CLASS.

DELINQUENCY RATES ARE A PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CONSUMER LOANS. LOANS THAT ARE MORE THAN

30 DAYS

PAST DUE PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING OF BORROWERS WHO MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND/OR WHO MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO REPAY THE LOAN. AS THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE, IT BECOMES MORE CLEAR THAT THE BORROWER IS LIKELY EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. IN THE CASE OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (GREATER THAN

150 DAYS

PAST DUE) ARE A STRONG INDICATOR OF LOANS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A FORECLOSURE OR SIMILAR LIQUIDATION TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS FOR CONSUMER LOANS VARY BASED ON THE CLASS OF LOAN, AS FOLLOWS.

•

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, INCLUDING BOTH NON-PCI AND PCI PORTFOLIOS, THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO, OR THE COMBINED LTV RATIO IN THE CASE OF JUNIOR LIEN LOANS, IS AN INDICATOR OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS SEVERITY IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, LTV OR COMBINED LTV CAN PROVIDE

INSIGHT INTO A BORROWER’S CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO PAY, AS THE DELINQUENCY RATE OF HIGH-LTV LOANS TENDS TO BE GREATER THAN THAT FOR LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOAN COLLATERAL ALSO PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO, AS FACTORS SUCH AS THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, HOME PRICE CHANGES AND SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS, WILL AFFECT CREDIT QUALITY. THE BORROWER’S CURRENT OR “REFRESHED” FICO SCORE IS A SECONDARY CREDIT-QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CERTAIN LOANS, AS FICO SCORES ARE AN INDICATION OF THE BORROWER’S CREDIT PAYMENT HISTORY. THUS, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A LOW FICO SCORE (

660

OR BELOW) IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF HIGHER RISK THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH FICO SCORE. FURTHER, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A LOW FICO SCORE IS AT GREATER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER THAT HAS BOTH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A HIGH FICO SCORE.

•

FOR SCORED AUTO, SCORED BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION IS AN INDICATOR OF THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SIMILAR TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE BASED ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EVENTS.

•

RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS ARE SIMILAR TO WHOLESALE LOANS IN THAT THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS ARE THE RISK RATING THAT IS ASSIGNED TO THE LOAN AND WHETHER THE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICIZED AND/OR NONACCRUAL. RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT BORROWERS’ ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT RISK-RATED WHOLESALE LOAN CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE PAGE

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION BY CLASS FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING RETAINED PCI LOANS IN THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ANALYZING CERTAIN CREDIT STATISTICS APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING PCI LOANS PORTFOLIO: (I) JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS MAY BE FULLY CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

180 DAYS

PAST DUE, AND THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN, RESULTING IN RELATIVELY HIGH CHARGE-OFF RATES FOR THIS PRODUCT CLASS; AND (II) THE LENGTHENING OF LOSS-MITIGATION TIMELINES MAY RESULT IN HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES FOR LOANS CARRIED AT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THAT REMAIN ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

(B) THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY OR WHEN THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOAN AMOUNT.

HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (“HELOCS”) BEYOND THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND HOME EQUITY LOANS (“HELOANS”) HAVE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES THAN DO HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THAT IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT THAT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED FOR THOSE PRODUCTS IS HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT OPTIONS

AVAILABLE FOR HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES ASSOCIATED WITH AMORTIZING HELOCS AND HELOANS ARE FACTORED INTO THE LOSS ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THE FIRM’S DELINQUENCY ROLL-RATE METHODOLOGY, WHICH ESTIMATES DEFAULTS BASED ON THE CURRENT DELINQUENCY STATUS OF A PORTFOLIO.

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF MODIFICATIONS AND REDEFAULTS

FOR AUTO LOANS, TDRS TYPICALLY OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER. IN THESE CASES, THE LOAN IS MODIFIED WITH A REVISED REPAYMENT PLAN THAT TYPICALLY INCORPORATES INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS. BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, CHAPTER 7 AUTO LOANS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TDRS.

FOR BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, CONCESSIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON INDIVIDUAL BORROWER CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAN BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE FOR BORROWERS WHO NEED TEMPORARY RELIEF OR LONGER TERM FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING MORE FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. CONCESSIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY TERM OR PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT ACQUISITION; PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER MAY BE AGGREGATED INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ALL OF THE CONSUMER PCI LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST) EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF EACH POOL. THESE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT REFLECT THEN-CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (I.E., INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES) TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL LOSS PLUS ANY RELATED FOREGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT THE POOL’S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (E.G., DECREASED CREDIT LOSSES, THE NET BENEFIT OF MODIFICATIONS) WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WITH ANY REMAINING INCREASES RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS. THE IMPACTS OF (I) PREPAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE INTEREST RATES, AND (III) ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MODIFY CERTAIN PCI LOANS. THE IMPACT OF THESE MODIFICATIONS IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS HAS OCCURRED, AND THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS PCI LOANS. IN EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF MODIFICATIONS ON EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, THE FIRM INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF ANY FOREGONE INTEREST AND ALSO CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT. THE FIRM DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE USED TO COMPUTE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO-DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED MODIFIED PCI LOANS.

THE EXCESS OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IS REFERRED TO AS THE ACCRETABLE YIELD. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT REPORTED ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BUT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF LOANS.

IF THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON PCI LOANS WERE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO INTEREST WOULD BE ACCRETED AND THE LOANS WOULD BE REPORTED AS NONACCRUAL LOANS; HOWEVER, SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRM’S PCI CONSUMER LOANS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, INTEREST IS BEING ACCRETED AND THE LOANS ARE BEING REPORTED AS PERFORMING LOANS.

THE LIQUIDATION OF PCI LOANS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF LOANS, RECEIPT OF PAYMENT IN FULL BY THE BORROWER, OR FORECLOSURE, RESULTS IN REMOVAL OF THE LOANS FROM THE UNDERLYING PCI POOL. WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS (E.G., CASH, REAL ESTATE), IF ANY, IS LESS THAN THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN, THE DIFFERENCE IS FIRST APPLIED AGAINST THE PCI POOL’S NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PRINCIPAL LOSSES (I.E., THE LIFETIME CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATE ESTABLISHED AS A PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT AT THE ACQUISITION DATE). WHEN THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR A PARTICULAR LOAN POOL HAS BEEN FULLY DEPLETED, ANY EXCESS OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN OVER THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS IS WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE PCI POOL’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. BECAUSE THE FIRM’S PCI LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT A POOL LEVEL, THE FIRM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS WHEN THEY REACH SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY (I.E., UNLIKE NON-PCI CONSUMER LOANS, THESE LOANS ARE NOT CHARGED OFF BASED ON FFIEC STANDARDS).

THE PCI PORTFOLIO AFFECTS THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF O

PERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH: (I) CONTRIBUTION TO NET INTEREST MARGIN; (II) EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFAULTS AND SERVICING RESULTING FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF THE LOANS; AND (III) ANY PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE FUNDED BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOANS. FOR EXAMPLE, VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH VARIABLE-RATE LIABILITIES AND FIXED-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH FIXED-RATE LIABILITIES WITH A SIMILAR MATURITY PROFILE. A NET SPREAD WILL BE EARNED ON THE DECLINING BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, TO HAVE A REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF

8

YEARS.

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WERE DUE TO REFINING THE EXPECTED INTEREST CASH FLOWS ON HELOCS WITH BALLOON PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WERE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF MODIFICATIONS, BUT ALSO RELATED TO CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS.

THE FACTORS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ESTIMATES OF GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, AND ACCORDINGLY THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE, INCLUDE: (I) CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE INDICES FOR VARIABLE-RATE PRODUCTS SUCH AS OPTION ARM AND HOME EQUITY LOANS; AND (II) CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS.

SINCE THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, THE DECREASE IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE-RATE LOANS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS. CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS EXTENDED OR SHORTENED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS, AFFECT THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND THE ACCRETABLE YIELD

PERCENTAGE, BUT NOT THE AMOUNT OF CASH EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED (I.E., THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE). WHILE EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS REDUCE THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE (BECAUSE THE SAME ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE IS RECOGNIZED AGAINST A HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOAN BALANCE OVER A LONGER-THAN-EXPECTED PERIOD OF TIME), SHORTENED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SEGMENT INCLUDES CREDIT CARD LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED BY THE FIRM. DELINQUENCY RATES ARE THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS AS THEY PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING THAT BORROWERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES (

30 DAYS

PAST DUE); INFORMATION ON THOSE BORROWERS THAT HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME (

90 DAYS

PAST DUE) IS ALSO CONSIDERED. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOANS PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY.

WHILE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE IS ANOTHER GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW CREDIT SCORES AS A PRIMARY INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY BECAUSE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE TENDS TO BE A LAGGING INDICATOR. HOWEVER, THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SCORES PROVIDES A GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. REFRESHED FICO SCORE INFORMATION, WHICH IS OBTAINED AT LEAST QUARTERLY, FOR A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO IS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW; FICO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE INDUSTRY BENCHMARK FOR CREDIT SCORES.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE

MAY OFFER ONE OF A NUMBER OF LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO CREDIT CARD BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. MOST OF THE CREDIT CARD LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MODIFICATIONS UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS INVOLVE PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN, GENERALLY FOR

60 MONTHS

. THE FIRM MAY ALSO OFFER SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO MAY BE IN NEED OF TEMPORARY RELIEF; HOWEVER, NONE ARE CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED. MODIFICATIONS UNDER ALL SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS TYPICALLY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT CARD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE TDRS.

IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. ASSUMING THAT THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT BEGIN TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PAYMENT TERMS, THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE AND WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. IN ADDITION, IF A BORROWER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THEN THE LOAN REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT REINSTATE THE BORROWER’S LINE OF CREDIT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO

WHOLESALE LOANS INCLUDE LOANS MADE TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR WHOLESALE LOANS IS THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED EACH LOAN. RISK RATINGS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS AND DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. RISK RATINGS ON LOANS CONSIDER THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (“PD”) AND THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (“LGD”). PD IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL DEFAULT AND NOT BE REPAID. THE LGD IS THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON THE LOAN THAT WOULD BE REALIZED UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE BORROWER AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE RISK RATING, INCLUDING THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED ALIGNS WITH THE BANKING REGULATORY DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURES, WHICH CONSIST OF SPECIAL MENTION, SUBSTANDARD AND DOUBTFUL CATEGORIES. RISK RATINGS GENERALLY REPRESENT RATINGS PROFILES SIMILAR TO THOSE DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S. INVESTMENT-GRADE RATINGS RANGE FROM “AAA/AAA” TO “BBB-/BAA3.” NONINVESTMENT-GRADE RATINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS NONCRITICIZED (“BB+/BA1 AND B-/B3”) AND CRITICIZED (“CCC+”/“CAA1 AND BELOW”), AND THE CRITICIZED PORTION IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO PERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS, REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CRITICIZED LOANS HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN NONCRITICIZED LOANS.

RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE RISK RATING OF A LOAN CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THE OVERALL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND CLIENT EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERN.

NOTE 15 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE CONSUMER, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS (PRIMARILY SCORED); AND WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) PORTFOLIO, AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTIMATES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING METHODOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE ON THE UNDERLYING LOANS. DURING

2013

, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES USED TO DETERMINE ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES; SUCH POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE RELATES TO LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, WHICH INCLUDES LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS AS WELL AS RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. TO DETERMINE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE SMALLER LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS POOLS USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. SCORED LOANS (I.E., CONSUMER LOANS) ARE POOLED BY PRODUCT TYPE, WHILE RISK-RATED LOANS (PRIMARILY WHOLESALE LOANS) ARE SEGMENTED BY RISK RATING.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MEASURES THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN IMPAIRMENT ARE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED USING AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE, AND THE ALLOWANCE IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE LOAN’S FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO AN ASSET-SPECIFIC RESERVE AS FOR OTHER IMPAIRED LOANS. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHARGE-OFFS AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF FOREGONE INTEREST, IF ANY, IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION AND ALSO INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF THE MODIFICATION ON THE LOAN’S EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT. FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, THE FIRM DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE APPLIED AT A LOAN LEVEL TO COMPUTE EXPECTED LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED MODIFIED LOANS. FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE PROJECTED REDEFAULTS BASED ON THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE BY TYPE OF MODIFICATION PROGRAM. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE REDEFAULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF THE BORROWER’S ABILITY TO REPAY UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION TO PROVIDE FOR INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN PERFORMING RISK-RATED LOANS AND ALL CONSUMER LOANS, EXCEPT FOR ANY LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TDRS AND PCI LOANS. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

258–283

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PCI LOANS.

FOR SCORED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS PERFORMED ON POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., PRODUCT TYPE) AND GENERALLY COMPUTED BY APPLYING LOSS FACTORS TO OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OVER AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD. THE LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD REPRESENTS THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATE AT WHICH THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THAT LOSS (THROUGH A CHARGE-OFF). ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS MAY VARY BY PRODUCT AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME; MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS, USING AVAILABLE CREDIT INFORMATION AND TRENDS.

284

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

LOSS FACTORS ARE STATISTICALLY DERIVED AND SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT SCORES, COLLATERAL VALUES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. THE FIRM USES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORECASTING MODELS TO ESTIMATE BOTH THE PD AND THE LOSS SEVERITY, INCLUDING DELINQUENCY ROLL RATE MODELS AND CREDIT LOSS SEVERITY MODEL

S.

IN DEVELOPING PD AND LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HOME PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS.

A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURE IS USED TO ESTIMATE BOTH THE PD AND THE LOSS SEVERITY ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (“MSA”) LEVEL. LOSS SEVERITY ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY VALIDATED BY COMPARISON TO ACTUAL LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON DEFAULTED LOANS, MARKET-SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS AND PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TYPE AND RESULTS OF SUCH MODIFICATIONS.

FOR RISK-RATED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ESTIMATED PD AND AN ESTIMATED LGD. THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND EXPECTED MATURITY. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL THROUGH-THE-CYCLE DATA, USING CREDIT-RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE FIRM’S HISTORY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK TO ADJUST THE RESULTS OF APPLYING THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF LOSS EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT THAT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS AND THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. FACTORS RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT, HOME PRICES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND LIEN POSITION

,

THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE-RELATED SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS AND UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. IN ADDITION, FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, ANY ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ALSO CONSIDER CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES.

MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO).

THE FIRM’S OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED WITH VIES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT, AS FOLLOWS.

•

ASSET MANAGEMENT: SPONSORS AND MANAGES CERTAIN FUNDS THAT ARE DEEMED VIES. AS ASSET MANAGER OF THE FUNDS, AM EARNS A FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUND’S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR FUND ENTITIES THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AM’S INTERESTS ARE, IN CERTAIN CASES, CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE ENTITIES.

•

COMMERCIAL BANKING: CB MAKES INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES LENDING TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES THAT MAY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE. IN ADDITION, CB PROVIDES FINANCING AND LENDING RELATED SERVICES TO CERTAIN CLIENT-SPONSORED VIES. IN GENERAL, CB DOES NOT CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES.

•

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY: THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT ARE DEEMED VIES. HOWEVER, THE FIRM’S PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SPECIALIZED INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATION OF INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VIES.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN AND PROVIDES FINANCING AND OTHER SERVICES TO VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

SIGNIFICANT FIRM-SPONSORED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD BUSINESS SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE “TRUST”). THE FIRM’S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLER’S INTEREST IN THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND MAINTAINING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE FIRM IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THESE FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS BASED ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH ITS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER DUTIES, INCLUDING MAKING DECISIONS AS TO THE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE TRANSFERRED INTO THOSE TRUSTS AND AS TO ANY RELATED MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRM’S OTHER CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUSTS, AS INDICATED ABOVE, OBLIGATES THE FIRM TO ABSORB LOSSES AND GIVES THE FIRM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THESE VIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

THE UNDERLYING SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR PAYMENT OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE FIRM’S OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR THE CLAIMS OF THE FIRM’S OTHER CREDITORS.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS (WHICH IS GENERALLY

4%

). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM HELD UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OF

$14.3 BILLION

AND

$15.8 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES OWNED BY THOSE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY

30%

AND

28%

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ALSO RETAINED

$130 MILLION

AND

$362 MILLION

OF SENIOR SECURITIES AND

$5.5 BILLION

AND

$4.6 BILLION

OF SUBORDINATED SECURITIES IN CERTAIN OF ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM’S UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS AND SECURITIES RETAINED ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FIRM-SPONSORED MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES (OR HAS SECURITIZED) ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS) PRIMARILY IN ITS CIB AND CCB BUSINESSES. DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS INVOLVED, THE FIRM MAY ACT AS THE SERVICER OF THE LOANS AND/OR RETAIN CERTAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

THE FIRM SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY CCB, AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES BY EITHER CCB OR CIB. CCB GENERALLY RETAINS SERVICING FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY CCB, AND FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED BY CIB. FOR SECURITIZATIONS SERVICED BY CCB, THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE BECAUSE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATED TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. CCB MAY ALSO RETAIN AN INTEREST UPON SECURITIZATION.

IN ADDITION, CIB ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING SECURITIES ISSUED BY FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. AS A RESULT, CIB AT TIMES RETAINS SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS) IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS UPON SECURITIZATION, AND/OR REACQUIRES POSITIONS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIONS RETAINED OR REACQUIRED BY CIB OR HELD BY CCB, WHEN CONSIDERED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY CCB, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF CERTAIN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE

296

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION (FIRM-SPONSORED OR THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED) WHEN IT IS NOT THE SERVICER (AND THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE TRUST) OR DOES NOT HOLD A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE TRUST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS OF CERTAIN FIRM-SPONSORED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VIES, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD AN INTEREST IN THESE TRUSTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE

296

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS

CIB ORIGINATES AND SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. CIB MAY RETAIN UNSOLD SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION BUT, GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT SERVICE COMMERCIAL LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE GENERALLY IS HELD BY THE SERVICER OR INVESTORS IN A SPECIFIED CLASS OF SECURITIES (“CONTROLLING CLASS”). SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE

296

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO SECURITIZES STUDENT LOANS. THE FIRM RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL ORIGINATED AND CERTAIN PURCHASED STUDENT LOANS AND HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH THESE SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE

296

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

RE-SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM ENGAGES IN CERTAIN RE-SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH DEBT SECURITIES ARE TRANSFERRED TO A VIE IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. THESE TRANSFERS OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH AGENCY (FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND GINNIE MAE) AND NONAGENCY (PRIVATE-LABEL) SPONSORED VIES, WHICH MAY BE BACKED BY EITHER RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ROLE AND INTEREST IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED

$25.3 BILLION

,

$10.0 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO AGENCY VIES, AND

$55 MILLION

,

$286 MILLION

AND

$381 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO PRIVATE-LABEL VIES.

MOST RE-SECURITIZATIONS WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED ARE CLIENT-DRIVEN TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A SPECIFIC CLIENT OR GROUP OF CLIENTS ARE SEEKING A SPECIFIC RETURN OR RISK PROFILE. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE DECISION-MAKING POWER OF THE ENTITY IS SHARED BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS CLIENT(S), CONSIDERING THE JOINT EFFORT AND DECISIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST AND ITS ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST THE CLIENT HOLDS IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST; THEREFORE THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN MORE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM CREATES A RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SPECIFIC CLIENTS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS MADE DURING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DESIGN OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE IF THE FIRM HOLDS AN INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MAY INVEST IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS OF THIRD-PARTY SECURITIZATIONS AND GENERALLY PURCHASES THESE INTERESTS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST, EITHER BECAUSE IT WASN’T INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL DESIGN OF THE TRUST, OR THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY SPONSOR AND DEMONSTRATES SHARED POWER OVER THE CREATION OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS BY THE CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS, AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE FIRM’S POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONDUITS.

TO ENSURE TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND TO PROVIDE THE CONDUITS WITH FUNDING TO PURCHASE INTERESTS IN OR MAKE LOANS SECURED BY POOLS OF RECEIVABLES IN THE EVENT THAT THE CONDUITS DO NOT OBTAIN FUNDING IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT VEHICLES WITH UNCOMMITTED PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED IS BASED UPON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE AND APPROXIMATES

10%

OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE.

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS THE FIRM HAS BOTH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONDUITS AND A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE CONDUITS. AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND IN ITS ROLE IN STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING ASSET TYPES AND CREDIT QUALITY, AND MANAGES THE COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING NEEDS OF THE CONDUITS. THE FIRM’S INTERESTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIES INCLUDE THE FEES RECEIVED AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LIQUIDITY AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE CREATED BY THE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS.

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

VIES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE VIES, TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVES, TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES AND ASSET SWAP VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM HAS CREATED A SERIES OF TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH QUALIFYING TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF SECURITIES: (1) PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS (“RESIDUAL INTERESTS”). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS IS TYPICALLY LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY “PUT,” OR TENDER, THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS WOULD FIRST REPAY ANY FUNDED LIQUIDITY FACILITY OR OUTSTANDING FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE REMAINING AMOUNT, IF ANY, WOULD BE PAID TO THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS. IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE

LIQUIDITY FACILITY, IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE TO THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT. CERTAIN RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL WITH THE FIRM, AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, TO SUPPORT SUCH REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS SHOULD THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINE.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT, OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE, OR IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING RATE CERTIFICATES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND, AND THE FIRM’S SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER. A DOWNGRADE IN ANY OF THESE RATINGS WOULD AFFECT THE RATING OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR. HOWEVER, A DOWNGRADE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S SHORT-TERM RATING DOES NOT AFFECT THE FIRM’S OBLIGATION UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM HELD

$262 MILLION

AND

$252 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM AT ANY TIME DURING

2013

WAS

$470 MILLION

, OR

4.8%

, OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES’ AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND HOLDINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

293

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTEREST. THE RESIDUAL INTEREST GENERALLY ALLOWS THE OWNER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE, PRIMARILY BY DIRECTING THE SALE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OWNED BY THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION, THE RESIDUAL INTEREST OWNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AND BEAR LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLE. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT DOES NOT OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, SINCE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE AND ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY RATED ASSETS, SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT HOLD. THE VIE THEN ISSUES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES (“CLNS”) WITH MATURITIES PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE VIE’S INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER USING A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN SUCH NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES IS PREDOMINANTLY INVESTMENT GRADE. THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES BROADLY INTO TWO TYPES: STATIC AND MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT EITHER REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATION), OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. IN A MANAGED CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT

DERIVATIVE GENERALLY REFERENCE ALL OR PART OF AN ACTIVELY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. AN AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN A PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND THE VIE THAT GIVES THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE EACH REFERENCED CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CREDIT. THE FIRM DOES NOT ACT AS PORTFOLIO MANAGER; ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO BEING A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, IN BOTH STATIC AND MANAGED CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE OF THE CREDITS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF REFERENCE CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS. THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS NOT HISTORICALLY PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CLN VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. SINCE EACH CLN IS ESTABLISHED TO THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE INVESTORS, THE INVESTORS HAVE THE POWER OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THAT VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLN. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE ENTITIES. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE.

294

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES AND EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET SWAP VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THE VIE PURCHASES A SPECIFIC ASSET OR ASSETS AND THEN ENTERS INTO A DERIVATIVE WITH THE FIRM IN ORDER TO TAILOR THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY RISK, OR BOTH, ACCORDING TO INVESTORS’ REQUIREMENTS. GENERALLY, THE ASSETS ARE HELD BY THE VIE TO MATURITY, AND THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVES WOULD MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE ASSETS. INVESTORS TYPICALLY INVEST IN THE NOTES ISSUED BY SUCH VIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE SPECIFIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE VIE MAY INCLUDE CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY INTO THE INVESTORS’ LOCAL CURRENCY OR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE; TO ADD ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE INTO THE VIE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RETURN ON THE ISSUED NOTES; OR TO CONVERT AN INTEREST-BEARING ASSET INTO A ZERO-COUPON BOND.

THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO ASSET SWAP VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTEREST RATE AND/OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM HISTORICALLY HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES, SINCE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED FIRM-SPONSORED AND THIRD-PARTY CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES WITH COLLATERAL FAIR VALUES OF

$311 MILLION

AND

, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CONSOLIDATED VIES INCLUDED SOME THAT WERE STRUCTURED BY THE FIRM WHERE THE FIRM PROVIDES THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE, AND SOME THAT HAVE BEEN STRUCTURED BY THIRD PARTIES WHERE THE FIRM IS NOT THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE PROVIDER. THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED THESE VEHICLES, BECAUSE IT HELD POSITIONS IN THESE ENTITIES THAT PROVIDED THE FIRM WITH CONTROL OF CERTAIN VEHICLES. THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY ASSET SWAP VEHICLES AT

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

VIE USED IN FRBNY TRANSACTION

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER IN JUNE 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK (“FRBNY”) TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH AN LLC FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF A PORTFOLIO OF

$30.0 BILLION

IN ASSETS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE LLC WERE FUNDED BY A

$28.85 BILLION

TERM LOAN FROM THE FRBNY

AND A

$1.15 BILLION

SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN WAS SUBORDINATED TO THE FRBNY LOAN AND BORE THE FIRST

$1.15 BILLION

OF ANY LOSSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF THE FRBNY LOAN, REPAYMENT OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LLC WAS FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE FRBNY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FRBNY AND JPMORGAN CHASE LOANS WERE REPAID DEPENDED ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND THE LIQUIDATION STRATEGY DIRECTED BY THE FRBNY. THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE LLC, AS IT DID NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. IN JUNE 2012, THE FRBNY LOAN WAS REPAID IN FULL AND IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN WAS REPAID IN FULL. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF

$665 MILLION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM HAS SECURITIZED AND SOLD A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT AND COMMERCIAL (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE) LOANS, AS WELL AS DEBT SECURITIES. THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THESE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WERE TO SATISFY INVESTOR DEMAND AND TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE TRUST, THE FIRM RECORDS THE TRANSFER OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE TO THE TRUST AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRM’S CREDITORS; (2) THE TRANSFEREE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST

HOLDER CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., THE FIRM CANNOT REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS).

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES A GAIN OR LOSS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED (INCLUDING CASH, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, OR SERVICING ASSETS RECEIVED) AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS SOLD. GAINS AND LOSSES ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, SELLS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED MORTGAGE LOANS AND CERTAIN ORIGINATED EXCESS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ON A NONRECOURSE BASIS, PREDOMINANTLY TO GINNIE MAE, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC (THE “AGENCIES”). THESE LOANS AND EXCESS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURITIZATION BY THE AGENCIES, WHICH ALSO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF THE LOANS AND EXCESS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS THROUGH CERTAIN GUARANTEE PROVISIONS. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES AS IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN SALES, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO SHARE A PORTION OF THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLD LOANS WITH THE PURCHASER. SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

OR

2012

, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DUE TO IMPAIRMENT DURING

2013

,

2012

OR

2011.

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT (AS DETERMINED IN STEP ONE) TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE BEING ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE RESULTING IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IS LESS THAN ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

299

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM USES THE REPORTING UNITS’ ALLOCATED EQUITY PLUS GOODWILL CAPITAL AS A PROXY FOR THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EQUITY FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. REPORTING UNIT EQUITY IS DETERMINED ON A SIMILAR BASIS AS THE ALLOCATION OF EQUITY TO THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPITAL THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III), ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. PROPOSED LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY LEVELS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS, WHICH IS REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ALLOCATED EQUITY IS FURTHER REVIEWED ON A PERIODIC BASIS AND UPDATED AS NEEDED.

THE PRIMARY METHOD THE FIRM USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS THE INCOME APPROACH. THE MODELS PROJECT CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND USE THE PERPETUITY GROWTH METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUES. THESE CASH FLOWS AND TERMINAL VALUES ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. PROJECTIONS OF CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS’ EARNINGS FORECASTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”)), AND WHICH ARE REVIEWED WITH THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF EQUITY FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT AND IS DETERMINED CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY (ESTIMATED USING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL), AS ADJUSTED FOR THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO EACH REPORTING UNIT (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK OR UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS OR MANAGEMENT’S FORECASTS AND ASSUMPTIONS). TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT MANAGEMENT COMPARES THE DISCOUNT RATE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF EQUITY (AGGREGATING THE VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS) IS COMPARED WITH THE FIRMS’ OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS.

THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH MARKET-BASED TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES FOR RELEVANT COMPETITORS. TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED AS GENERAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE GENERAL REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ALTHOUGH PRECISE CONCLUSIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE DRAWN DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES THAT NATURALLY EXIST BETWEEN THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S MARKET CAPITALIZATION. IN EVALUATING THIS COMPARISON, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING (A) A CONTROL PREMIUM THAT WOULD EXIST IN A MARKET TRANSACTION, (B) FACTORS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION RISK THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL THAT DO

NOT EXIST AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AND (C) SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS.

WHILE NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS RECOGNIZE

D,

T

HE FIRM’S MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS IN CCB REMAINS AT AN ELEVATED RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO ITS EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE VALUATION OF THIS BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT UPON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING PRIMARY MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES, LOWER MORTGAGE ORIGINATION VOLUME, NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND HOME PRICES), REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES (FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES), AND THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIRED. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION MODELS INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL NECESSARY GIVEN THE RISK OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES TO MEET REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WERE DETERMINED USING MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATES. THE COST OF EQUITY REFLECTED THE RELATED RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON TO RELEVANT MARKET PEERS. DETERIORATION IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. THE FAIR VALUE CONSIDERS ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICING FEES AND ANCILLARY REVENUE, OFFSET BY ESTIMATED COSTS TO SERVICE THE LOANS, AND GENERALLY DECLINES OVER TIME AS NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS ARE RECEIVED, EFFECTIVELY AMORTIZING THE MSR ASSET AGAINST CONTRACTUAL SERVICING AND ANCILLARY FEE INCOME. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RECOGNIZED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS IF SERVICING IS RETAINED.

AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS MSRS AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM TREATS ITS MSRS AS A SINGLE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS MSR ASSET AND ITS TREATMENT OF MSRS AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (“OAS”) MODEL, WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRM’S PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, COSTS TO SERVICE, LATE CHARGES AND OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, AND ALSO CONSIDERS RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. MSRS TYPICALLY DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE BECAUSE DECLINING INTEREST RATES TEND TO INCREASE PREPAYMENTS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS THAT COMPRISE THE MSR ASSET. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (E.G., MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (I.E.,

THOSE FOR WHICH THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. JPMORGAN CHASE USES COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY INTEREST-RATE RELATED CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ADVANCES IS MINIMAL BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ADVANCES IS TYPICALLY SENIOR TO ALL CASH PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS THE RIGHT TO STOP PAYMENT TO INVESTORS IF THE COLLATERAL IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE ADVANCE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF THESE SERVICER ADVANCES MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IF THEY WERE NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE RULES AND AGREEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

301

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR DECREASED BY

$6.4 BILLION

. THIS DECREASE WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF

$5.4 BILLION

. THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY GAINS OF

$5.6 BILLION

ON DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE THE MSR ASSET; THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS SEPARATELY FROM THE MSR ASSET. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET WAS A

$1.7 BILLION

DECREASE RELATED TO REVISED COST TO SERVICE AND ANCILLARY INCOME ASSUMPTIONS INCORPORATED IN THE MSR VALUATION. THE INCREASED COST TO SERVICE ASSUMPTIONS REFLECTED THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF HIGHER SERVICING COSTS TO ENHANCE SERVICING PROCESSES, PARTICULARLY LOAN MODIFICATION AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES, INCLUDING COSTS TO COMPLY WITH CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH BANKING REGULATORS. THE INCREASE IN THE COST TO SERVICE ASSUMPTION CONTEMPLATED SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED INCREASES IN STAFFING LEVELS IN THE CORE AND DEFAULT SERVICING FUNCTIONS. THE DECREASED ANCILLARY INCOME ASSUMPTION WAS SIMILARLY RELATED TO A REASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS PRACTICES IN CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSENT ORDERS AND THE EXISTING INDUSTRY-WIDE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WAS BROADLY AFFECTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

ALSO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM REVISED ITS OAS ASSUMPTION AND UPDATED ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL; THESE CHANGES HAD GENERALLY OFFSETTING EFFECTS. THE FIRM’S OAS ASSUMPTION IS BASED UPON CAPITAL AND RETURN REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE PENDING BASEL III CAPITAL RULES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OAS ASSUMPTION FOR THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

400

BASIS POINTS AND DECREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION.

FINALLY, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM FURTHER ENHANCED ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO INCORPORATE: (I) THE IMPACT OF THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAM (“HARP”) 2.0, AND (II) ASSUMPTIONS THAT TO LIMIT MODELED REFINANCINGS DUE TO THE COMBINED INFLUENCES OF RELATIVELY STRICT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND REDUCED LEVELS OF EXPECTED HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE REFINEMENTS INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE ARE OFTEN HIGHLY INTERRELATED AND MAY NOT BE LINEAR. IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH WOULD EITHER MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE IMPACT OF THE INITIAL CHANGE.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

THE FIRM’S INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET COMPARES THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 26 – INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, AND FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THUS, THE FIRM’S FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED.

,

OF TAX BENEFITS RECORDED IN

2013

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TAX EFFECT OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF

$2.1 BILLION

IN 2013, A DECREASE OF

$1.9 BILLION

IN 2012, AND AN INCREASE OF

$927 MILLION

IN

2011.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. BASED ON JPMORGAN CHASE’S ONGOING REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS, THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES. AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FOR

2013

, PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$3.4 BILLION

WERE GENERATED AND WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED

THESE UNRECOGNIZED ITEMS INCLUDE THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, THE PORTION OF GROSS STATE AND LOCAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT FROM ASSOCIATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS, AND THE PORTION OF GROSS NON-U.S. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT WOULD HAVE OFFSETS IN OTHER JURISDICTION

S. JPMORGAN CHASE IS PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAXING AUTHORITIES, MOST NOTABLY BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, NEW YORK STATE AND CITY, AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS SUMMARIZED IN THE TAX EXAMINATION STATUS TABLE BELOW. BASED UPON THE STATUS OF ALL OF THE TAX EXAMINATIONS CURRENTLY IN PROCESS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS THE RESOLUTION OF SOME OF THESE EXAMINATIONS COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS; HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION, IF ANY.

THE BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

”) IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC. THE BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, AND ITS DEPOSITS IN THE U.S. ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRM’S BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$5.3 BILLION

AND

$5.6 BILLION

IN

2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO

10%

OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY’S TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO

20%

OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY’S TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST FROM

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

, AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATOR’S OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT

JANUARY 1, 2014

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$29.8 BILLION

IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN

2014

WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES’ EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF

$17.2 BILLION

AND

$25.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$1.5 BILLION

AND

$0.7 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE FIRM HAD OTHER RESTRICTED CASH OF

$3.9 BILLION

AND

$3.4 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY REPRESENTING CASH RESERVES HELD AT NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS AND HELD FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES.

NOTE 28 – REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS, FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRM’S NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

, AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2 CAPITAL, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL CAPITAL IS TIER 1 CAPITAL PLUS TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED QUARTERLY AVERAGE ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE REGULATORY CAPITAL, ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SIGNIFICANT BANKING SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THESE AMOUNTS ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND/OR OCC. THE TABLE REFLECTS THE FIRM’S AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES THAT PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING POSITIONS AND SECURITIZATIONS (“BASEL 2.5”). BASEL 2.5 RULES BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ON JANUARY 1, 2013. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$150 BILLION

NOTE 29 – OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

TO PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) AND WHOLESALE LENDING COMMITMENTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

284–287

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL CREDIT CARD LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE FIRM MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY, OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. ALSO, THE FIRM TYPICALLY CLOSES CREDIT CARD LINES WHEN THE BORROWER IS

60 DAYS

OR MORE PAST DUE.

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT GENERALLY COMPRISE COMMITMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES AND BOND FINANCINGS IN THE EVENT THAT THOSE OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE REMARKETED TO NEW INVESTORS AS WELL AS COMMITTED LIQUIDITY FACILITIES TO CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS.

ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE COMMITMENTS TO NONINVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH LEVERAGED AND ACQUISITION FINANCE ACTIVITIES, WHICH WERE

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2013

, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED PROSPECTIVELY INTERAGENCY GUIDANCE THAT REVISED THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF LEVERAGED LENDING TO INCLUDE ALL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BORROWERS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE AFFILIATED WITH FINANCIAL SPONSORS, WHICH MEET CERTAIN LEVERAGE CRITERIA AND USE OF PROCEEDS PURPOSE TESTS RELATED TO A BUYOUT, ACQUISITION OR CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, THE FIRM DEFINED LEVERAGED LENDING AS PRIMARILY BEING AFFILIATED WITH A FINANCIAL SPONSOR-RELATED COMPANY AND USED INTERNAL RISK GRADES TO IDENTIFY THE LEVERAGED LENDING PORTFOLIO.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 3 AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES

195–215

AND

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ACTS AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. IN ITS ROLE AS CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF THE CASH BORROWERS, USUALLY BROKER-DEALERS; HOWEVER, THIS EXPOSURE IS SECURED BY COLLATERAL AND TYPICALLY EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS BY THE END OF THE DAY. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE DAILY BALANCES AVERAGED

FOR THE

GUARANTEES

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. U.S. GAAP DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTY’S FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER U.S. GAAP: STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM INITIALLY RECORDS GUARANTEES AT THE INCEPTION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION ASSUMED (E.G., THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE). FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GUARANTEES, THE FIRM RECORDS THIS FAIR VALUE AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN CASH (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVED), OR OTHER ASSETS (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE). ANY PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IS REDUCED AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. FOR INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED IN SALES AGREEMENTS, A PORTION OF THE SALE PROCEEDS IS ALLOCATED TO THE GUARANTEE, WHICH ADJUSTS THE GAIN OR LOSS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT FROM THE TRANSACTION. FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, THE INITIAL LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED TO INCOME AS THE FIRM’S RISK IS REDUCED (I.E., OVER TIME OR WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES). ANY CONTINGENT LIABILITY THAT EXISTS AS A RESULT OF ISSUING THE GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION IS RECOGNIZED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE CONTINGENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT RECOGNIZED IF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION (ADJUSTED FOR ANY AMORTIZATION). THE RECORDED AMOUNTS OF THE LIABILITIES RELATED TO GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT (“SBLC”) AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY THE FIRM TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. THE CARRYING VALUES OF STANDBY AND OTHER LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE

THE RATINGS SCALE IS BASED ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RATINGS WHICH GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO RATINGS AS DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S.

ADVISED LINES OF CREDIT

AN ADVISED LINE OF CREDIT IS A REVOLVING CREDIT LINE WHICH SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM MAY MAKE AVAILABLE TO AN OBLIGOR, ON A NONBINDING BASIS. THE BORROWER RECEIVES WRITTEN OR ORAL ADVICE OF THIS FACILITY. THE FIRM MAY CANCEL THIS FACILITY AT ANY TIME BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS

THROUGH THE FIRM’S SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS’ SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM PROVIDES AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING AGREEMENTS WHICH PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES. TO MINIMIZE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING

100%

OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL MAY BE RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS, THE FIRM WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF.

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON EXERCISE BY THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT OPTION CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR OTHER TRADING PURPOSES. THE TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTS SUCH AS STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTY’S REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “STABLE VALUE WRAPS”, ARE

TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO REALIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO AND ARE TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM OR MAY HAVE NO STATED MATURITY, BUT ALLOW THE FIRM TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS

$56.3 BILLION

AND

$61.7 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN STABLE VALUE CONTRACTS IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT; THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT ON THESE STABLE VALUE CONTRACTS WAS

$27.0 BILLION

AND

$26.5 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS WAS

$2.8 BILLION

AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH THE GSES AND OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES

288–299

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT

, THE FIRM HAS MADE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS S

OLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM HAS BEEN, AND MAY BE, REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE GSES (E.G., WITH “MAKE-WHOLE” PAYMENTS TO REIMBURSE THE GSES FOR THEIR REALIZED LOSSES ON LIQUIDATED LOANS) AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT ARE RECEIVED RELATE TO LOANS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES THAT REMAIN VIABLE, THE FIRM TYPICALLY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE THIRD PARTY. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WOUL

D BE EQUAL TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SUCH LOANS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFECTS THAT WERE SOLD TO PURCHASERS (INCLUDING SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES) PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

ON OCTOBER 25, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD REACHED A

$1.1 BILLION

AGREEMENT WITH THE FHFA TO RESOLVE, OTHER THAN CERTAIN LIMITED TYPES OF EXPOSURES, OUTSTANDING AND FUTURE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES FROM 2000 TO 200

8 (“FHFA SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT”). THE MAJORITY OF THE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED FROM THE GSES RELATED TO LOANS ORIGINATED FROM 2005 TO 2008.

THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED A MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF

$681 MILLION

AND

$2.8 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.  THE AMOUNT OF THE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, RELATES TO REPURCHASE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY THE FHFA SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (E.G., POST-2008 LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS AND CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURANCE SETTLEMENT-RELATED EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS).

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE RMBS TRUST SETTLEMENT, ALL REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, WHETHER RESULTING FROM A REPURCHASE DEMAND OR OTHERWISE, ARE NOW RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRM’S LITIGATION RESERVES FOR THIS SETTLEMENT.

PRIVATE LABEL SECURITIZATIONS

THE LIABILITY RELATED TO REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVATE LABEL SECURITIZATIONS IS SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY THE FIRM IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD REACHED A

$4.5 BILLION

AGREEMENT WITH

21

MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TO MAKE A BINDING OFFER TO THE TRUSTEES OF

330

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES TRUST ISSUED BY J.P.MORGAN, CHASE, AND BEAR STEARNS (“RMBS TRUST SETTLEMENT”) TO RESOLVE ALL REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS, AS WELL AS ALL SERVICING CLAIMS, ON ALL TRUST ISSUED BY J.P.MORGAN, CHASE, AND BEAR STEARNS BETWEEN 2005 AND 2008. THE RMBS TRUST SETTLEMENT MAY BE SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

IN ADDITION, FROM 2005 TO 2008, WASHINGTON MUTUAL MADE CERTAIN LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH APPROXIMATELY

$165 BILLION

OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY SOLD OR DEPOSITED INTO PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL. OF THE

$165 BILLION

, APPROXIMATELY

$75 BILLION

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON RECOURSE SERVICING PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE LOAN AND THE COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE FIRM’S SECURITIZATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE TOTALED

$7.7 BILLION

AND

$9.3 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM HAS RECORDED, WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRM’S VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD IT WILL HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER ITS RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS, WAS

$131 MILLION

AND

$141 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS – GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN LIEU OF MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (“SOFTWARE LICENSEES”) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (“THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS”), PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, CARD’S MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS AND A SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN PAYMENT PROCESSING AND MERCHANT ACQUIRING.

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS PRIMARILY LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBER’S FAVOR, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBER’S ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF CHASE PAYMENTECH IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. CHASE PAYMENTECH MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; (2) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND (3) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD RECOGNIZE THE LOSS.

CHASE PAYMENTECH INCURRED AGGREGATE LOSSES OF

$14 MILLION

,

$16 MILLION

, AND

$13 MILLION

ON

$750.1 BILLION

,

$655.2 BILLION

, AND

$553.7 BILLION

OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY. INCURRED LOSSES FROM MERCHANT CHARGE-BACKS ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE, WITH THE OFFSET RECORDED IN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS

$5 MILLION

AND

$6 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY CHASE PAYMENTECH OF

$208 MILLION

AND

$203 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY, IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAYMENT OR PERFORMANCE RISK TO THE FIRM RELATED TO CHARGE-BACKS.

CLEARING SERVICES - CLIENT CREDIT RISK

THE FIRM PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES FOR CLIENTS ENTERING INTO SECURITIES PURCHASES AND SALES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, WITH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (“CCPS”), INCLUDING EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVES (“ETDS”) SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS CLEARED OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC-CLEARED”) DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER, THE FIRM STANDS BEHIND THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS CLIENTS, COLLECTS CASH AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL (MARGIN) AS WELL AS ANY SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS DUE FROM OR TO CLIENTS, AND REMITS THEM TO THE RELEVANT CCP OR CLIENT IN WHOLE OR PART. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MARGIN. VARIATION MARGIN IS POSTED ON A DAILY BASIS BASED ON THE VALUE OF CLIENTS’ DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. INITIAL MARGIN IS POSTED AT INCEPTION OF A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, GENERALLY ON THE BASIS OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE  VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENT FOR THE CONTRACT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

323

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS CLEARING MEMBER, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS, BUT IS NOT LIABLE TO CLIENTS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CCPS. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS RISK TO THE CLIENT THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF MARGIN AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND CAN ALSO CEASE PROVISION OF CLEARING SERVICES IF CLIENTS DO NOT ADHERE TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEARING AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY A CLIENT, THE FIRM WOULD CLOSE OUT THE CLIENT’S POSITIONS AND ACCESS AVAILABLE MARGIN. THE CCP WOULD UTILIZE ANY MARGIN IT HOLDS TO MAKE ITSELF WHOLE, WITH ANY REMAINING SHORTFALLS REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY THE FIRM AS CLEARING MEMBER.

THE FIRM REFLECTS ITS EXPOSURE TO NON-PERFORMANCE RISK OF THE CLIENT THROUGH THE RECOGNITION OF MARGIN PAYABLES OR RECEIVABLES TO CLIENTS AND CCPS, BUT DOES NOT REFLECT THE CLIENTS UNDERLYING  SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE THROUGH ITS ROLE AS CLEARING MEMBER, AS THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF TRANSACTIONS THAT CLIENTS MAY EXECUTE IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND THE CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE RISK OF LOSS IS EXPECTED TO BE REMOTE.

FOR INFORMATION ON THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND RECORDS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

220–233

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EXCHANGE & CLEARING HOUSE MEMBERSHIPS

THROUGH THE PROVISION OF CLEARING SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRM’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GUARANTEE FUND. ALTERNATIVELY, THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE A FULL PRO-RATA SHARE OF THE RESIDUAL LOSSES AFTER APPLYING THE GUARANTEE FUND. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“PARENT COMPANY”) MAY PROVIDE COUNTERPARTIES WITH GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN OF THE TRADING AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH THE FIRM’S COUNTERPARTIES. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, OR ARE REFLECTED AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS; THEREFORE, THE PARENT COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED A SEPARATE LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT THAT WOULD TRIGGER PAYMENTS BY THE PARENT COMPANY UNDER THESE GUARANTEES IS REMOTE.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BOTH LONG-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES SOLD AS PART OF THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE GUARANTEES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE

OF THIS NOTE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 21 ON PAGES

NOTE 31 – LITIGATION

CONTINGENCIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEFENDANTS OR PUTATIVE DEFENDANTS IN NUMEROUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PRIVATE, CIVIL LITIGATIONS AND REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. THE LITIGATIONS RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS INVOLVING A SINGLE PLAINTIFF TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WITH POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF CLASS MEMBERS. INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVE BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS, BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE AT VARYING STAGES OF ADJUDICATION, ARBITRATION OR INVESTIGATION, AND INVOLVE EACH OF THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING COMMON LAW TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AND STATUTORY ANTITRUST, SECURITIES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS), SOME OF WHICH PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF RESERVES ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS FROM

$0

TO APPROXIMATELY

$5.0 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. THIS ESTIMATED AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES IS BASED UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FIRM’S BEST ESTIMATE OF SUCH LOSSES FOR THOSE CASES FOR WHICH SUCH ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE. FOR CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN CURRENTLY BE MADE. THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, GIVEN THE VARYING STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY ARE CURRENTLY IN PRELIMINARY STAGES), THE EXISTENCE IN MANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS OF MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) WHOSE SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED, THE NUMEROUS YET-UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MANY OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING ISSUES REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THE SCOPE OF MANY OF THE CLAIMS) AND THE ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL LOSSES MAY VARY.

SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BEAR STEARNS HEDGE FUND MATTER.

IN SEPTEMBER 2013, AN ACTION BROUGHT BY BANK OF AMERICA AND BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC (TOGETHER “BOFA”) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST BEAR STEARNS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC. (“BSAM”) RELATING TO ALLEGED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT STRATEGIES MASTER FUND, LTD. AND THE BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT STRATEGIES ENHANCED LEVERAGE MASTER FUND, LTD. WAS DISMISSED AFTER THE COURT GRANTED BSAM’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. BOFA HAS DETERMINED NOT TO APPEAL THE DISMISSAL.

CIO INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION

. THE FIRM IS RESPONDING TO A CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, A CONSOLIDATED PURPORTED CLASS ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT AND SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED IN NEW YORK STATE COURT AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AS WELL AS SHAREHOLDER DEMANDS AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, RELATING TO LOSSES IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGED BY THE FIRM’S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”). THE FIRM CONTINUES TO COOPERATE WITH ONGOING GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. THE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS ARE IN EARLY STAGES WITH DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO DISMISS PENDING.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION

. IN JULY 2013, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (THE “EC”) FILED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM (INCLUDING VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES) AND OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (“CDS”) MARKETPLACE. THE EC ASSERTS THAT BETWEEN 2006 AND 2009, A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT BANKS ACTED COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION (“ISDA”) AND MARKIT GROUP LIMITED (“MARKIT”) TO FORECLOSE EXCHANGES FROM THE POTENTIAL MARKET FOR EXCHANGE-TRADED CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY INSTRUCTING MARKIT AND ISDA TO LICENSE THEIR RESPECTIVE DATA AND INDEX BENCHMARKS ONLY FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) TRADING AND NOT FOR EXCHANGE TRADING, ALLEGEDLY TO PROTECT THE INVESTMENT BANKS’ REVENUES FROM THE OTC MARKET. THE FIRM SUBMITTED A RESPONSE TO THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JANUARY 2014. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (THE “DOJ”) ALSO HAS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE CDS MARKETPLACE, WHICH WAS INITIATED IN JULY 2009.

SEPARATELY, THE FIRM IS A DEFENDANT IN

NINE

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS (ALL CONSOLIDATED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK) FILED ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS AND SELLERS OF CDS AND ASSERTING FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW CLAIMS. EACH OF THE COMPLAINTS REFERS TO THE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY THE EC AND DOJ INTO THE CDS MARKET, AND ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANT INVESTMENT BANKS AND DEALERS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, AS WELL AS MARKIT AND/OR ISDA,

COLLECTIVELY PREVENTED NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE CDS MARKET, IN ORDER TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE THE DEFENDANTS’ OTC

REVENUES.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED INFORMATION REQUESTS, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION NOTICES AND RELATED INQUIRIES FROM VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE FIRM’S FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING BUSINESS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES AND THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES.

SINCE NOVEMBER 2013, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATED DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST A NUMBER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALERS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT BASED ON AN ALLEGED CONSPIRACY TO MANIPULATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES REPORTED ON THE WM/REUTERS SERVICE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2013 ANNUAL REPORT

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION.

A GROUP OF MERCHANTS AND RETAIL ASSOCIATIONS FILED A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS RELATING TO INTERCHANGE IN SEVERAL FEDERAL COURTS. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGED THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD, AS WELL AS CERTAIN BANKS, CONSPIRED TO SET THE PRICE OF CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES, ENACTED RESPECTIVE RULES IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS, AND ENGAGED IN TYING/BUNDLING AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING. ALL CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE PARTIES HAVE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THOSE CASES, FOR A CASH PAYMENT OF

$6.05 BILLION

TO THE CLASS PLAINTIFFS (OF WHICH THE FIRM’S SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY

20%

) AND AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

TEN

BASIS POINTS OF CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FOR A PERIOD OF

EIGHT

MONTHS TO BE MEASURED FROM A DATE WITHIN

(COLLECTIVELY, THE “BANKS”) ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER WITH THE OCC REGARDING COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PROCESSES PURSUANT TO WHICH THE BANKS AGREED TO TAKE CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT CARD, STUDENT LOAN, AUTO LOAN, BUSINESS BANKING AND COMMERCIAL BANKING CUSTOMERS WHO DEFAULTED ON THEIR LOAN OR CONTRACT.

SEPARATELY, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND MULTIPLE STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FIRM’S COLLECTION AND SALE OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DEBT. THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSISSIPPI ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE FILED SEPARATE CIVIL ACTIONS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AND CHASE BANKCARD SERVICES, INC. ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATING TO DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES.

WASHINGTON MUTUAL LITIGATIONS.

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL’S FAILURE ARE PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND INCLUDE A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY, INITIALLY AGAINST THE FDIC, ASSERTING AN ESTIMATED

$6 BILLION

TO

$10 BILLION

IN DAMAGES BASED UPON ALLEGED BREACH OF VARIOUS MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS AND ALLEGED VIOLATION OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN BY CERTAIN WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. (“WMI”) SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. THE CASE INCLUDES ASSERTIONS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY HAVE ASSUMED LIABILITIES FOR THE ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED AS PREMATURE MOTIONS BY THE FIRM AND THE FDIC THAT SOUGHT A RULING ON WHETHER THE FDIC RETAINED LIABILITY FOR DEUTSCHE BANK’S CLAIMS. DISCOVERY IS UNDERWAY.

AN ACTION FILED BY CERTAIN HOLDERS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK DEBT AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE, WHICH ALLEGED THAT JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK FROM THE FDIC AT A PRICE THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY TOO LOW, REMAINS PENDING. JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC MOVED TO DISMISS THIS ACTION AND THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED THE CASE EXCEPT AS TO THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM THAT THE FIRM TORTIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH THE PLAINTIFFS’ BOND CONTRACTS WITH WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK PRIOR TO ITS CLOSURE. DISCOVERY IS ONGOING.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ALSO FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AGAINST THE FDIC IN ITS CAPACITY AS RECEIVER FOR WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK AND IN ITS CORPORATE CAPACITY ASSERTING MULTIPLE CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE & ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC RELATING TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S PURCHASE OF MOST OF THE ASSETS AND CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK.

*     *     *

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IT INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN ALL SUCH MATTERS. ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED OF ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FIRM ACCRUES FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM SUCH PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EACH QUARTER TO ASSESS ITS LITIGATION RESERVES, AND MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IN SUCH RESERVES, UPWARDS OR DOWNWARDS, AS APPROPRIATE, BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S BEST JUDGMENT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE FIRM INCURRED

$11.1 BILLION

,

$5.0 BILLION

AND

$4.9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF LEGAL EXPENSE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S LITIGATION RESERVES WILL NOT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE MATTERS PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOMES OF THE CURRENTLY PENDING MATTERS, THE TIMING OF THEIR ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OR THE EVENTUAL LOSSES, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FIRM NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES IT HAS CURRENTLY ACCRUED; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE FIRM’S SEGMENT RESULTS FOR

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

ON A MANAGED BASIS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE (NONINTEREST REVENUE AND NET INTEREST INCOME) FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS IS PRESENTED ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (“FTE”) BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS PRESENTED ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES; THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE/(BENEFIT).

THE INCREASE IN EQUITY LEVELS FOR THE LINES OF BUSINESSES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2012, IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE EVOLVING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHER CAPITAL TARGETS THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED UNDER BASEL III ADVANCED APPROACH.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

LLC.

LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY.

LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIO.

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, THE RELATIONSHIP, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE, BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF A LOAN AND THE APPRAISED VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL (I.E., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE) SECURING THE LOAN.

ORIGINATION DATE LTV RATIO

THE LTV RATIO AT THE ORIGINATION DATE OF THE LOAN. ORIGINATION DATE LTV RATIOS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE ACTUAL APPRAISED VALUES OF COLLATERAL (I.E., LOAN-LEVEL DATA) AT THE ORIGINATION DATE.

CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO

AN ESTIMATE OF THE LTV AS OF A CERTAIN DATE. THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS ARE CALCULATED USING ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES DERIVED FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURED AT THE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (“MSA”) LEVEL. THESE MSA-LEVEL HOME PRICE INDICES COMPRISE ACTUAL DATA TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE AND FORECASTED DATA WHERE ACTUAL DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES; AS SUCH, THE RESULTING LTV RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

MANAGED BASIS.

A NON-GAAP PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT INCLUDES RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT REVENUE ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS. MANAGEMENT USES THIS NON- GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THIS PROVIDES INFORMATION TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FACILITATES A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPETITORS.

ALT-A LENDING CHARACTERISTICS MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (I) LIMITED DOCUMENTATION; (II) A HIGH COMBINED LOAN-TO-VALUE (“CLTV”) RATIO; (III) LOANS SECURED BY NON-OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES; OR (IV) A DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO ABOVE NORMAL LIMITS. A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF THE FIRM’S ALT-A LOANS ARE THOSE WHERE A BORROWER DOES NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF HIS OR HER ASSETS OR THE AMOUNT OR SOURCE OF HIS OR HER INCOME.

OPTION ARMS

THE OPTION ARM REAL ESTATE LOAN PRODUCT IS AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN THAT PROVIDES THE BORROWER WITH THE OPTION EACH MONTH TO MAKE A FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY OR MINIMUM PAYMENT. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON AN OPTION ARM LOAN IS BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE IS USUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED RATE. THE FULLY INDEXED RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN INDEX RATE PLUS A MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD ENDS, THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON THE LOAN INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE AND ADJUSTS MONTHLY TO REFLECT MOVEMENTS IN THE INDEX. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO COVER INTEREST ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR MONTH, AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IS DEFERRED AND ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN. OPTION ARM LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT RECAST, WHICH CONVERTS THE LOAN TO A VARIABLE-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN UPON MEETING SPECIFIED LOAN BALANCE AND ANNIVERSARY DATE TRIGGERS.

PRIME

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ARE MADE TO BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT RECORDS AND A MONTHLY INCOME AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THEIR MONTHLY HOUSING EXPENSE (MORTGAGE PAYMENTS PLUS TAXES AND OTHER DEBT PAYMENTS). THESE BORROWERS PROVIDE FULL DOCUMENTATION AND GENERALLY HAVE RELIABLE PAYMENT HISTORIES.

SUBPRIME

SUBPRIME LOANS ARE LOANS TO CUSTOMERS WITH ONE OR MORE HIGH RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) UNRELIABLE OR POOR PAYMENT HISTORIES; (II) A HIGH LTV RATIO OF GREATER THAN 80% (WITHOUT BORROWER-PAID MORTGAGE INSURANCE); (III) A HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO; (IV) AN OCCUPANCY TYPE FOR THE LOAN IS OTHER THAN THE BORROWER’S PRIMARY RESIDENCE; OR (V) A HISTORY OF DELINQUENCIES OR LATE PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.

IMPACT OF NONACCRUAL LOANS AND ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS ON INTEREST INCOME

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM NONACCRUAL LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH NONACCRUAL LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS HAD THEY BEEN PERFORMING AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THIS DATA FOR THE YEARS SPECIFIED. THE CHANGE IN FOREGONE INTEREST INCOME FROM

2011

THROUGH

2013

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CHANGE IN THE LEVELS OF NONACCRUAL LOANS.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL’S (“FFIEC”) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK.

THE REPORTING OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION, BY COUNTRY AND SECTOR, OF CLAIMS ON, AND LIABILITIES TO, FOREIGN RESIDENTS HELD BY U.S. BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND IS USED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF CREDIT AND RELATED RISKS,

INCLUDING TRANSFER AND COUNTRY RISK.  COUNTRY LOCATION UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REPORTING IS BASED ON WHERE THE ENTITY OR COUNTERPARTY IS LEGAL ESTABLISHED.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

149–152.

JPMORGAN CHASE
