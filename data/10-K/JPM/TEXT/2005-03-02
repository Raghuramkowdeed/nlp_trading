ITEM 1: BUSINESS

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2004, BANK ONE CORPORATION (BANK ONE) MERGED WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE &

CO. (THE MERGER), PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER DATED JANUARY 14, 2004. AS A RESULT

OF THE MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF BANK ONE WAS CONVERTED IN A

STOCK-FOR-STOCK EXCHANGE INTO 1.32 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE

OR

THE FIRM).

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE

PURCHASE PRICE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WAS $58.5 BILLION.

BANK ONES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2004.

THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECT SIX MONTHS

OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED FIRM AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE; THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR ALL OTHER PERIODS

PRIOR TO 2004

REFLECT ONLY THE OPERATIONS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE.

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN

CHASE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH $1.2 TRILLION IN

ASSETS, $106 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH BRANCHES IN 17 STATES, AND CHASE BANK

USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE USA), A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRMS CREDIT

CARD-ISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.

(JPMSI), ITS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES

AND AFFILIATED BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH

ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON

FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED, PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR

SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF

ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO SIX BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT) AND CORPORATE, WHICH INCLUDES ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY AND TREASURY BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS CORPORATE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT

BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS (MD&A) BEGINNING ON PAGE 28, AND IN NOTE 31 ON PAGE 126.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING

COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED

COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH THESE OTHER FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OFFERED AND THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO

SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE

FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS ON THE

RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE FEATURES OF ITS PRODUCTS APPEAL TO

CUSTOMERS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FIRM IS ABLE TO MEET ITS CLIENTS OBJECTIVES OR NEEDS. THE

FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND

OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED.

THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE MERGER OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND

BANK ONE CORPORATION ON JULY 1, 2004. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE

GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY BE LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR

THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW,

INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED (THE BHCA).

UNDER THE 1999 GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA), BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MEETING CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY

CRITERIA MAY ELECT TO BECOME FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, WHICH MAY ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT

HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD) AND THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT). JPMORGAN

CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000.

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL

ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY

REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE

DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND CRA

REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA.

HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES

ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE

SUBSIDIARIES (E.G., THE LEAD BANK IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC), SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC, AND

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS).

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE THAT ARE NATIONAL BANKS. NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE

NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH

AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A

RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND

MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS

OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS,

UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. UNDER THE

UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE

NOTE 23 ON PAGE 116 FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD

PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2005 AND 2004, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE

APPROVAL OF THE RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY TO

PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING

REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT

OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFF-BALANCE SHEET

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED

FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED

INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE

AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE

GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

TIER 1 COMPONENTS.

CAPITAL SURPLUS AND COMMON STOCK REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT FORMS OF CAPITAL AT

JPMORGAN CHASE. BECAUSE COMMON EQUITY HAS NO MATURITY DATE, AND BECAUSE DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK

ARE PAID ONLY

WHEN AND IF DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMMON EQUITY IS AVAILABLE TO ABSORB LOSSES OVER

LONG PERIODS OF TIME. NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IS SIMILAR TO COMMON STOCK IN ITS

ABILITY TO ABSORB LOSSES. IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DOES NOT DECLARE A DIVIDEND ON NONCUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK IN ANY DIVIDEND PERIOD, THE HOLDERS OF THE INSTRUMENT ARE NEVER ENTITLED

TO RECEIVE THAT DIVIDEND PAYMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES OUTSTANDING NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK IS A TYPE COMMONLY REFERENCED AS A FRAP: A FIXED-RATE/ ADJUSTABLE PREFERRED STOCK.

BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE ON FRAPS MAY INCREASE (UP TO A PREDETERMINED CEILING), THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TREATS THE FIRMS NONCUMULATIVE FRAPS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO CUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED SECURITIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD PERMITS CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL BUT ONLY UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS, AS THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS DO NOT PROVIDE AS STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES AS COMMON EQUITY AND NONCUMULATIVE,

NON-FRAP SECURITIES. CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK DOES NOT HAVE A MATURITY DATE, SIMILAR TO

OTHER FORMS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. HOWEVER, ANY DIVIDENDS NOT DECLARED ON CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL

PREFERRED STOCK ACCUMULATE AND THUS CONTINUE TO BE DUE TO THE HOLDER OF THE INSTRUMENT UNTIL ALL

ARREARAGES ARE SATISFIED. ON MARCH 1, 2005, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD ISSUED A

FINAL RULE THAT CONTINUES THE INCLUSION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

IN TIER 1 CAPITAL,

SUBJECT TO STRICTER QUANTITATIVE LIMITS. THE RULE PROVIDES FOR A

FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE

IMPACT OF THE FINAL RULE. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE IS

DEPENDENT ON THE DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER. TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE

GENERALLY ISSUED BY A SPECIAL-PURPOSE TRUST ESTABLISHED AND OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. PROCEEDS FROM

THE ISSUANCE TO THE PUBLIC OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITY ARE LENT TO THE FIRM FOR AT LEAST 30

(BUT NOT MORE THAN 50) YEARS. THE INTERCOMPANY NOTE THAT EVIDENCES THIS LOAN PROVIDES THAT THE

INTEREST PAYMENTS BY JPMORGAN CHASE ON THE NOTE MAY BE DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. DURING THE

PERIOD OF ANY SUCH DEFERRAL, NO PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS MAY BE MADE ON ANY OUTSTANDING JPMORGAN CHASE

PREFERRED OR COMMON STOCK OR ON THE OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED TO THE PUBLIC.

DURING 2003, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO.

46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46), WHICH ADDRESSES THE CONSOLIDATION RULES

TO BE APPLIED TO ENTITIES DEFINED IN FIN 46 AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. PRIOR TO FIN 46,

TRUSTS THAT ISSUED TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES WERE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE

PARENTS. AS A RESULT OF FIN 46, JPMORGAN CHASE IS NO LONGER PERMITTED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE TRUSTS.

TIER 2 COMPONENTS.

LONG-TERM SUBORDINATED DEBT (GENERALLY HAVING AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF 10-12

YEARS) IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF JPMORGAN CHASES TIER 2 CAPITAL. SUBORDINATED DEBT IS DEEMED A FORM

OF REGULATORY CAPITAL, BECAUSE PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT ARE SUBORDINATED TO OTHER CREDITORS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE, INCLUDING HOLDERS OF SENIOR AND MEDIUM LONG-TERM DEBT AND COUNTERPARTIES ON DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE

LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (NET OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES, GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR

WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK.

OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY

BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR

CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, CERTAIN

RISKS ARISING FROM NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RISKS AS

IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING AN INSTITUTIONS OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY. OTHER FACTORS

TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY FEDERAL REGULATORS INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE; LIQUIDITY, FUNDING

AND MARKET RISK; THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS; THE QUALITY OF LOANS AND INVESTMENTS; THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF LOAN AND INVESTMENT POLICIES; AND MANAGEMENTS OVERALL ABILITY TO MONITOR AND

CONTROL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS PRESENTED BY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

AND NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES INCORPORATE A

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY ACTIVITIES AND IN THE TRADING OF DEBT AND

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE MARKET RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WITH LARGE

TRADING ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE) TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK IN AN AMOUNT

CALCULATED BY USING THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OWN INTERNAL VALUE-AT-RISK MODELS (SUBJECT TO

PARAMETERS SET BY THE REGULATORS).

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED A

REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). JPMORGAN CHASE IS ACTIVELY PURSUING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

BASEL II FRAMEWORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITERIA OF THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS, WHICH WILL

REQUIRE JPMORGAN CHASE TO USE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, EMPLOYING ITS INTERNAL ESTIMATES

OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IMPLEMENTATION OF BASEL II BY U.S.

REGULATORS IS EXPECTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, WITH CERTAIN TRANSITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

ARRANGEMENTS.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A

FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING

COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS; AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT REQUIRES THE RELEVANT

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES.

THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE;

HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED

ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR

CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE FIRM AND ITS PRIMARY BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

FDICIA ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT

SYSTEM FOR FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. UNDER THE FDICS RISK-BASED INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENT SYSTEM,

EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO ONE OF NINE RISK CLASSIFICATIONS BASED UPON CERTAIN

CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES AND, DEPENDING UPON ITS CLASSIFICATION, IS ASSESSED INSURANCE

PREMIUMS ON ITS DEPOSITS.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN

CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL, WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING

IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN

FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF

PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON ITS

INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE

BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO

PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE

APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS

(REFERENCED BELOW AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF

THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION,

INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE

INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD

BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH

AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK OR CHASE USA, THE PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND

COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN, THE DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT.

ON OCTOBER 26, 2001, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED INTO LAW THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF

2001 (THE ACT).

THE ACT SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENS EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL

JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES; IMPOSES NEW COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS; CREATES

NEW CRIMES AND PENALTIES; COMPELS THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS LOCATED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THOSE OF NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CORRESPONDENT RELATIONSHIP IN

THE UNITED STATES; AND CLARIFIES THE SAFE HARBOR FROM CIVIL LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS. THE ACT

MANDATES THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE ACTS

REQUIREMENTS OR PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON THEIR APPLICATION.

THE ACT REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS DEFINED, TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. THE ACT REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS FOR NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS, OR PERSONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

PRIVATE BANKING FOR NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH

APPROPRIATE, SPECIFIC AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND

CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND REPORT INSTANCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING THROUGH

THOSE ACCOUNTS.

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES ITS PROGRAMS SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT. BANK

REGULATORS ARE FOCUSING THEIR EXAMINATIONS ON ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE, AND JPMORGAN CHASE

CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES

TO SUPPORT THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY

VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING

COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS

TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

ANY LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF

PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATORY AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK AT A CERTAIN LEVEL WOULD BE

ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW

ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE

RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

THE FIRMS BANK AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF

WHICH ARE CONSIDERED

FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

BY THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF

ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF

PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO

CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES THROUGH JPMSI AND OTHER

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC AND THE NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. (NASD). JPMSI IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE

(NYSE). THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE

SEC. THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, THE EQUAL CREDIT

OPPORTUNITY, THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE AND THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS

TRANSFER ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE

REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING, ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION OF CONSUMER LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF

DISCLOSURES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOANS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE

REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH

RESPECT TO (1) THE SHARING OF NON-PUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND

OTHERS; AND (2) THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS

ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

NON-AFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN GLBA.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FIRM HAS MADE AND WILL MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS

CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OFTEN USE WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, TARGET, EXPECT, ESTIMATE,

INTEND, PLAN, GOAL, BELIEVE OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

PROVIDE JPMORGAN CHASES CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR

RESULTS. JPMORGAN CHASES DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING IN THE MD&A SECTION, CONTAIN

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN ITS OTHER

DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC AND IN OTHER WRITTEN MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS SENIOR

MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ORALLY TO ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, REPRESENTATIVES OF

THE MEDIA AND OTHERS.

ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE

MADE. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT

OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT ARISE AFTER THE DATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WAS MADE. THE

READER SHOULD, HOWEVER, CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE JPMORGAN CHASE

MAY MAKE IN ITS ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ITS CURRENT

REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN ITS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE FIRMS FUTURE FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE TO VARY FROM THAT DESCRIBED IN ITS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE CREDIT,

MARKET, OPERATIONAL, LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED IN THE MD&A SECTION OF THIS

REPORT AND IN OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS

FORTH CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES COULD CAUSE ITS ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS

TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED RESULTS. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS BESIDES THOSE LISTED BELOW OR

DISCUSSED IN JPMORGAN CHASES REPORTS TO THE SEC ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS,

AND THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY SUCH LIST OF FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES. THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

MERGER OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK ONE.

THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE FIRMS MERGER WITH BANK ONE. FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES AND COST SAVINGS ANTICIPATED TO BE DERIVED FROM THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KEY EMPLOYEES, OR THAT THE DISRUPTION OF ONGOING BUSINESS FROM THE MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS OR SUPPLIERS.

BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMY.

THE PROFITABILITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES COULD BE

AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD. IN 2004 BOTH THE U.S.

AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN OVERALL. WHILE THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRM FOR 2005

CONTINUES TO BE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE ECONOMIC

RECOVERY THAT BEGAN IN 2003 WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 2005.

FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF EQUITY

PRICES AND INTEREST RATES, INVESTOR SENTIMENT, INFLATION, AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF CLIENTS, WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING

OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO MAY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS

PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A RECURRENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE

IN THE REVENUES IT RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. HIGHER INTEREST RATES OR

CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET ALSO COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL INVESTORS TO

PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRM GENERALLY

MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS AND

HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS HELD BY ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS. THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ARE

AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING;

VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND IN EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS; AND THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND

BUSINESS FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT THESE REVENUES WILL FLUCTUATE

OVER TIME.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING

MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE MUTUAL FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD

AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUES. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS MAY BE

AFFECTED BY BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IN A POOR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT

MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER

OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVELS OF CHARGE-OFFS AND

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

U.S. INTEREST RATES, THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CHANGES IN

CONSUMER SPENDING AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AS THESE FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL

OF CONSUMER LOANS AND CREDIT QUALITY.

COMPETITION.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS VARIOUS

FACTORS TO CAUSE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY. THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITION TO

INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER,

BETTER-CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, AND AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF

E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO COMPETE WITH TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES IN PROVIDING ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS.

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS; TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,

INCLUDING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD COMMONLY KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. JPMORGAN CHASES

BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM

UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC DEVELOPMENTS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY,

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION,

CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. JPMORGAN CHASE

ALSO INVESTS IN THE SECURITIES OF CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING

EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE

FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE

ACCENTUATED, BECAUSE GENERALLY, NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKET

COUNTRIES, ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS.

OPERATIONAL RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASE, LIKE ALL LARGE CORPORATIONS, IS EXPOSED TO MANY TYPES OF

OPERATIONAL RISK, INCLUDING THE RISK OF FRAUD BY EMPLOYEES OR OUTSIDERS, UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS

BY EMPLOYEES OR OPERATIONAL ERRORS, INCLUDING CLERICAL OR RECORD-KEEPING ERRORS OR THOSE RESULTING

FROM FAULTY OR DISABLED COMPUTER OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE HIGH VOLUME OF

TRANSACTIONS AT JPMORGAN CHASE, CERTAIN ERRORS MAY BE REPEATED OR COMPOUNDED BEFORE THEY ARE

DISCOVERED AND SUCCESSFULLY RECTIFIED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS NECESSARY DEPENDENCE UPON AUTOMATED

SYSTEMS TO RECORD AND PROCESS ITS TRANSACTION VOLUME MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE RISK THAT TECHNICAL

SYSTEM FLAWS OR EMPLOYEE TAMPERING OR MANIPULATION OF THOSE SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN LOSSES THAT ARE

DIFFICULT TO DETECT. THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS, ARISING

FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER

VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES), WHICH MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO

CUSTOMERS AND TO LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM IS FURTHER EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT ITS

EXTERNAL VENDORS MAY BE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO THE FIRM (OR WILL BE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME RISK OF FRAUD OR OPERATIONAL ERRORS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES AS IS THE

FIRM), AND TO THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS (OR ITS VENDORS) BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA

SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE NOT TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ADEQUATE. THE FIRM ALSO FACES THE RISK THAT THE

DESIGN OF ITS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES PROVE INADEQUATE OR ARE CIRCUMVENTED, THEREBY CAUSING DELAYS

IN DETECTION OR ERRORS IN INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS DESIGNED TO

KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASE WILL NOT

SUFFER LOSSES FROM OPERATIONAL RISKS IN THE FUTURE THAT MAY BE MATERIAL IN AMOUNT.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE

AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND

EARNINGS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL OR OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE

OF INTEREST PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND ALSO

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR

LENDING AND INVESTING. THE NATURE AND IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

AND FISCAL POLICIES ARE UNCERTAIN AND ARE BEYOND THE FIRMS CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES

AND CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

REPUTATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED. THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR

TO APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD

CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

ETHICAL ISSUES; MONEY-LAUNDERING; PRIVACY; RECORD-KEEPING; SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES; AND THE

PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN

ITS PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD ALSO GIVE RISE TO ADDITIONAL

LEGAL RISK TO THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD INCREASE THE SIZE AND

NUMBER OF LITIGATION CLAIMS AND DAMAGES

ASSERTED AGAINST THE FIRM OR SUBJECT THE FIRM TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, FINES AND PENALTIES.

CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK.

JPMORGAN CHASES REVENUES ALSO ARE DEPENDENT

UPON THE EXTENT TO WHICH MANAGEMENT CAN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES WITHIN A

DISCIPLINED RISK ENVIRONMENT. JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO GROW ITS BUSINESSES IS AFFECTED BY

PRICING AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, AS WELL AS BY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. TO THE EXTENT

ANY OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND STRATEGIES THE FIRM USES TO HEDGE OR OTHERWISE MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

MARKET, CREDIT AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MITIGATE

EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURES IN PARTICULAR MARKET ENVIRONMENTS OR AGAINST PARTICULAR TYPES OF

RISK. THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET GROWTH WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DESCRIBED

ABOVE, AS WELL AS ON ITS DETERMINATION TO SECURITIZE, SELL, PURCHASE OR SYNDICATE PARTICULAR LOANS

OR LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS TRADING REVENUES AND INTEREST RATE RISK ARE DEPENDENT UPON ITS

ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PROPERLY, AND MARK TO MARKET, CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES. THE FIRMS EARNINGS WILL ALSO BE DEPENDENT UPON HOW

EFFECTIVELY ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE USED IN ITS PRIVATE EQUITY

VALUATIONS, PROVE ACCURATE AND UPON HOW EFFECTIVELY IT DETERMINES AND ASSESSES THE COST OF CREDIT

AND MANAGES ITS RISK CONCENTRATIONS. TO THE EXTENT ITS ASSESSMENTS OF MIGRATIONS IN CREDIT QUALITY

AND OF RISK CONCENTRATIONS, OR ITS ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES USED IN ESTABLISHING VALUATION MODELS

FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR FOR LOAN LOSS RESERVES, PROVE INACCURATE OR NOT

PREDICTIVE OF ACTUAL RESULTS, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER HIGHER-THAN-ANTICIPATED LOSSES. THE SUCCESSFUL

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN

MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK, AS EVALUATION BY RATING AGENCIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE

RISKS AFFECTS THEIR DETERMINATIONS AS TO THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS AND, THEREFORE, ITS COST OF

FUNDS.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD

AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING 2,508 RETAIL BRANCHES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOR CORPORATE

PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN

LIGHT OF THE MERGER WITH BANK ONE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF

ITS EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS. SUCH

DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OCCUPANCY EXPENSE, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION ON PAGE 22.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS AND INVESTIGATIONS ARISING

OUT OF ITS BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENRON CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (ENRON). A LAWSUIT IN

LONDON BY THE FIRM AGAINST WESTDEUTSCHE LANDESBANK GIROZENTRALE (WLB) SOUGHT TO COMPEL PAYMENT OF

$165 MILLION UNDER AN ENRON-RELATED LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUED BY WLB. WLB RESISTED PAYMENT ON THE

HIDE ENRONS DEBT. THE TRIAL OF THAT ACTION WAS CONDUCTED IN JUNE AND JULY

2004, AND ON AUGUST 3, 2004, THE COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION IN FAVOR OF JPMORGAN CHASE, FINDING THAT

THE FIRM DID NOT COMMIT FRAUD AND ORDERING WLB TO PAY THE LETTER OF CREDIT IN FULL.

THAT ORDER HAS BECOME FINAL.

WORLDCOM LITIGATION.

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMSI) AND JPMORGAN CHASE WERE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN MORE THAN 50 ACTIONS THAT WERE FILED IN U.S. DISTRICT COURTS, IN STATE COURTS IN MORE

THAN 20 STATES, AND IN ONE ARBITRAL PANEL BEGINNING IN JULY 2002, ARISING OUT OF ALLEGED ACCOUNTING

IRREGULARITIES IN THE BOOKS AND RECORDS OF WORLDCOM INC. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS ARE INDIVIDUAL

AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, INCLUDING STATE PENSION FUNDS, WHO PURCHASED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY

WORLDCOM PURSUANT TO PUBLIC OFFERINGS IN 1997, 1998, 2000 AND 2001. JPMSI ACTED AS AN UNDERWRITER

OF THE 1998, 2000 AND 2001 OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION TO JPMSI, JPMORGAN CHASE AND, IN TWO ACTIONS,

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD. (JPMSL), IN ITS CAPACITY AS ONE OF THE UNDERWRITERS OF THE

INTERNATIONAL TRANCHE OF THE 2001 OFFERING, THE DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS OF THE ACTIONS INCLUDE OTHER

UNDERWRITERS, CERTAIN EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS OF WORLDCOM, AND WORLDCOMS AUDITORS. IN THE

FACTS CONCERNING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS OF WORLDCOM. THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST JPMORGAN

CHASE, JPMSI AND JPMSL ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS, UNDER OTHER STATE

STATUTES AND

UNDER COMMON-LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD AND NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION. IN THE CLASS ACTION PENDING

IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, WHICH INVOLVES CLAIMS ON

APPROXIMATELY $15 BILLION OF WORLDCOM BONDS, THE COURT DENIED SUMMARY JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT

TO THE ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISREPRESENTATION AND CERTAIN ALLEGED

OMISSIONS CLAIMS, AND TRIAL IS PRESENTLY

SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE IN LATE MARCH 2005.

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LITIGATION.

JPMSI (FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE SECURITIES INC.) HAS BEEN

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT WERE FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA IN 1999, ARISING FROM THE FAILURE OF COMMERCIAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (CFS). PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS ARE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO

PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION (ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT) OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY

CFS. THE SECURITIES WERE BACKED BY CHARGED-OFF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. IN ADDITION TO JPMSI, THE

DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS OF THE ACTIONS ARE THE FOUNDERS AND KEY EXECUTIVES OF CFS, AS WELL AS ITS

AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL. JPMSI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN THE INVESTMENT BANKER TO CFS AND TO

HAVE ACTED AS AN INITIAL PURCHASER AND PLACEMENT AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN

OF THE SECURITIES. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS KNEW, OR WERE RECKLESS OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT

KNOWING, THAT THE SECURITIES WERE SOLD TO PLAINTIFFS ON THE BASIS OF MISLEADING MISREPRESENTATIONS

AND OMISSIONS OF MATERIAL FACTS. THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST JPMSI ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, UNDER THE OKLAHOMA SECURITIES ACT AND UNDER COMMON-LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD AND

NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION. PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION,

PLUS PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ADDITIONAL INTEREST THAT CONTINUES TO ACCRUE, AND ATTORNEYS FEES. CFS

HAS COMMENCED AN ACTION AGAINST JPMSI IN OKLAHOMA STATE COURT AND HAS ASSERTED CLAIMS AGAINST JPMSI

FOR PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE AND BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. CFS ALLEGES THAT JPMSI FAILED TO DETECT

AND PREVENT ITS INSOLVENCY. CFS SEEKS DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION. CFS ALSO HAS

COMMENCED, IN ITS BANKRUPTCY CASE, AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING AGAINST JPMSI AND ITS CREDIT CARD

MILLION, MADE IN CONNECTION WITH CFSS PURCHASE OR SECURITIZATION OF CHARGED-OFF CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES WERE CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES, AND IT SEEKS TO RECOVER SUCH PAYMENTS AND

INTEREST. A TRIAL DATE ON THE ADVERSARY PROCEEDING HAS BEEN SET FOR MAY 2005. THE FEDERAL

SECURITIES ACTIONS HAVE BEEN SET FOR TRIAL IN JULY 2005.

IPO ALLOCATION LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MAY 2001, JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SECURITIES

SUBSIDIARIES WERE NAMED, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS

IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THESE SUITS PURPORT TO CHALLENGE ALLEGED IMPROPRIETIES IN THE

ALLOCATION OF STOCK IN VARIOUS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, INCLUDING SOME OFFERINGS FOR WHICH A JPMORGAN

CHASE ENTITY SERVED AS AN UNDERWRITER. THE SUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST LAWS

ARISING FROM ALLEGED MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS IN REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND

PROSPECTUSES FOR THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS) AND ALLEGED MARKET MANIPULATION WITH RESPECT

TO AFTERMARKET TRANSACTIONS IN THE OFFERED SECURITIES. THE SECURITIES CLAIMS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, MISREPRESENTATION AND MARKET MANIPULATION OF THE AFTERMARKET TRADING FOR THESE OFFERINGS BY

TYING ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN IPOS TO UNDISCLOSED EXCESSIVE

COMMISSIONS PAID TO JPMORGAN CHASE AND TO REQUIRED AFTERMARKET PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN

THE RESPECTIVE IPOS, AS WELL AS ALLEGATIONS OF MISLEADING ANALYST REPORTS. THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS

ALLEGE AN ILLEGAL CONSPIRACY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS, IN EXCHANGE FOR IPO ALLOCATIONS, TO PAY

UNDISCLOSED AND EXCESSIVE

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

COMMISSIONS AND TO MAKE AFTERMARKET PURCHASES OF THE IPO SECURITIES AT A PRICE HIGHER

THAN THE OFFERING PRICE AS A PRECONDITION TO RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS. THE SECURITIES CASES WERE ALL

ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER JUDGE. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2003, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND

UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS HAVE PETITIONED TO APPEAL THAT DECISION. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2005, THE COURT

PRELIMINARILY APPROVED A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AGAINST THE ISSUER DEFENDANTS IN

THESE CASES. WITH RESPECT TO THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS, ON NOVEMBER 3, 2003, THE COURT GRANTED

DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE IPO ALLOCATION PRACTICES, AND THAT

JPMSI HAS BEEN NAMED AS A CO-DEFENDANT WITH NINE OTHER BROKER-DEALERS

IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN COLORADO, SEEKING AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF

MONEY DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS RELATED TO ANALYST INDEPENDENCE

ISSUES; AND AN ACTION FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT BY WEST VIRGINIAS ATTORNEY GENERAL,

SEEKING RECOVERY FROM THE DEFENDANTS IN THE AGGREGATE OF $5,000 FOR EACH OF WHAT ARE ALLEGED TO BE

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VIOLATIONS OF THE STATES CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE. ON AUGUST 8, 2003,

THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE COLORADO ACTION DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. IN WEST VIRGINIA,

THE COURT DENIED DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS, AND DEFENDANTS ARE PURSUING AN INTERLOCUTORY

APPEAL TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT.

JPMSI WAS SERVED BY THE SEC, NASD AND NYSE ON OR ABOUT MAY 30, 2003, WITH SUBPOENAS OR DOCUMENT

REQUESTS SEEKING INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN PRESENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES IN

CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION FOCUSING ON WHETHER PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS PROPERLY PERFORMED

SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS REGARDING DOMESTIC EQUITY RESEARCH. THE REGULATORS ALSO RAISED ISSUES

REGARDING JPMSIS DOCUMENT RETENTION PROCEDURES AND POLICIES AND PURSUED A BOOKS-AND-RECORDS CHARGE

AGAINST IT CONCERNING E-MAIL THAT ITS HERITAGE ENTITIES COULD NOT RETRIEVE FOR THE PERIOD PRIOR TO

JULY 2001. JPMSI HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY ALL OF THE

REGULATORS TO SETTLE THIS MATTER FOR A PAYMENT OF A $2.1 MILLION PENALTY WITHOUT ADMITTING OR

NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, JPMORGAN

PARTNERS, BEACON GROUP, LLC AND THREE CURRENT OR FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN ACTIONS FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (THE MDL LITIGATION). IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACTIONS,

BANK ONE, BANK ONE, N.A., AND BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. ARE ALSO NAMED AS DEFENDANTS. JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK AND BANK ONE, N.A. ARE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY THE UNENCUMBERED ASSETS

TRUST (UAT), A TRUST CREATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS OF NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL

ENTERPRISES, INC. (NCFE) AS A RESULT OF NCFES PLAN OF LIQUIDATION IN BANKRUPTCY. THESE ACTIONS

AROSE OUT OF THE NOVEMBER 2002 BANKRUPTCY OF NCFE. PRIOR TO BANKRUPTCY, NCFE PROVIDED FINANCING TO

VARIOUS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHOLLY-OWNED SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES, INCLUDING NPF VI AND

NPF XII, WHICH PURCHASED DISCOUNTED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE PAID UNDER THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE

PROGRAMS. NPF VI AND NPF XII FINANCED THE PURCHASES OF SUCH RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE

PLACEMENTS OF NOTES (NOTES) TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PLEDGED THE RECEIVABLES FOR, AMONG

OTHER

THINGS, THE REPAYMENT OF THE NOTES. IN THE MDL LITIGATION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS SUED IN ITS ROLE

AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF VI, WHICH ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN NOTES. BANK ONE, N.A. IS

SUED IN ITS ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF XII, WHICH ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION IN NOTES.

THE THREE CURRENT OR FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES ARE SUED IN THEIR ROLES AS FORMER MEMBERS OF NCFES

BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES). JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND BEACON GROUP,

LLC, ARE CLAIMED TO BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE FOR THE ALLEGED ACTIONS OF THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES. BANC

ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE AS CO-MANAGER FOR THREE NOTE OFFERINGS MADE BY NPF

XII. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE THE FOUNDERS AND KEY EXECUTIVES OF NCFE, ITS AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, AND RATING AGENCIES AND PLACEMENT AGENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE

NOTES. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO PURCHASED MORE THAN $2.7

BILLION IN ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY NCFE. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT

THE TRUSTEES VIOLATED FIDUCIARY AND CONTRACTUAL DUTIES, IMPROPERLY PERMITTED NCFE AND ITS

AFFILIATES TO VIOLATE THE APPLICABLE INDENTURES AND VIOLATED SECURITIES LAWS BY (AMONG OTHER

THINGS) FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE NCFE ARRANGEMENTS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE

THAT THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES CONTROLLED THE BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE NCFE ENTITIES; WERE

FULLY AWARE OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT KNOWING OF NCFES ALLEGED MANIPULATION OF ITS BOOKS; AND ARE LIABLE

FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR PURPORTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE ALLEGED FRAUD TO THE PLAINTIFFS.

PLAINTIFFS ALSO ALLEGE THAT BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. IS LIABLE FOR COOPERATING IN THE SALE OF

SECURITIES BASED ON FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS. MOTIONS TO DISMISS ON BEHALF OF THE JPMORGAN

CHASE ENTITIES, THE BANK ONE ENTITIES AND THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. IN THE UAT

ACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND BANK ONE ARE SUED IN THEIR ROLES AS INDENTURE TRUSTEES. CLAIMS ARE

ASSERTED UNDER THE FEDERAL RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO), THE OHIO

CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND VARIOUS COMMON-LAW CLAIMS. RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS IN THE UAT ACTION HAVE

ON JUNE 29, 2004, BANC ONE INVESTMENT ADVISORS (BOIA) ENTERED INTO A

SETTLEMENT WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SEC RELATED TO ALLEGED MARKET TIMING IN THE

ONE GROUP MUTUAL FUNDS. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT, BOIA PAID $10 MILLION IN RESTITUTION AND FEE

DISGORGEMENT PLUS A CIVIL PENALTY OF $40 MILLION. BOIA ALSO AGREED TO REDUCE FEES OVER A FIVE-YEAR

PERIOD IN THE AMOUNT OF $8 MILLION PER YEAR, CONSENTED TO A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER AND A CENSURE,

AND AGREED TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN COMPLIANCE AND MUTUAL FUND GOVERNANCE REFORMS. ADDITIONALLY,

JPMORGAN CHASE, BANK ONE, AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND OFFICERS HAVE BEEN NAMED, ALONG WITH

NUMEROUS OTHER ENTITIES RELATED TO THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS IN PRIVATE-PARTY

LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF ALLEGED LATE TRADING AND MARKET TIMING IN MUTUAL FUNDS. THE ACTIONS HAVE

BEEN FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND. CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE THAT BOIA AND RELATED ENTITIES AND OFFICERS ALLOWED FAVORED INVESTORS TO MARKET TIME AND

LATE TRADE IN THE ONE GROUP MUTUAL FUNDS. THESE COMPLAINTS INCLUDE A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION ON

BEHALF OF ONE GROUP SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGING CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND COMMON LAW; A

PURPORTED DERIVATIVE SUIT ON BEHALF OF THE ONE GROUP FUNDS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT, THE

INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT AND COMMON LAW; AND A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF PARTICIPANTS AND

BENEFICIARIES OF THE BANK ONE CORPORATION 401(K) PLAN, ALLEGING CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2004, CERTAIN OTHER PLAINTIFFS IN THE FEDERAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BANK OF AMERICA SECURITIES, CANADIAN IMPERIAL COMMERCE BANK, BEAR STEARNS AND CFSB, PROVIDED

FINANCING TO CANARY CAPITAL WHICH WAS USED TO ENGAGE IN THE MARKET TIMING AND LATE TRADING.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND JPMSI ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE FINANCED KNOWINGLY THE MARKET TIMING AND LATE TRADING

BY CANARY CAPITAL AND EDWARD STERN, AND KNOWINGLY TO HAVE CREATED SHORT-POSITION EQUITY BASKETS TO

ALLOW CANARY CAPITAL TO PROFIT FROM TRADING IN A FALLING MARKET. ON FEBRUARY 25, 2005,

BOIA, JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMSI AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED MOTIONS TO DISMISS THESE ACTIONS.

CERTAIN JPMORGAN CHASE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE ALSO RECEIVED VARIOUS SUBPOENAS AND INFORMATION REQUESTS

RELATING TO MARKET TIMING AND LATE TRADING IN MUTUAL FUNDS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER

AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SEC, THE NASD, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NEW

YORK, WEST VIRGINIA AND VERMONT, AND REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, LUXEMBOURG, THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND, CHILE AND HONG KONG. THE FIRM IS FULLY COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

ON JANUARY 12, 2005, BANK ONE SECURITIES CORPORATION (BOSC) ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE

NASD PURSUANT TO WHICH BOSC WAS CENSURED AND AGREED TO PAY A $400,000 FINE FOR ITS ALLEGED FAILURE

TO IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE SUPERVISORY SYSTEMS AND WRITTEN PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO DETECT AND PREVENT

LATE TRADING OF MUTUAL FUNDS, AND FOR INACCURATELY RECORDING THE ENTRY TIME FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS.

BANK ONE SECURITIES LITIGATION.

BANK ONE AND SEVERAL FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE DEFENDANTS

IN THREE CLASS ACTIONS AND ONE INDIVIDUAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF THE MERGERS BETWEEN BANC ONE

CORPORATION (BANC ONE) AND FIRST COMMERCE CORPORATION (FIRST COMMERCE), AND BANC ONE

CORPORATION AND FIRST CHICAGO NBD CORPORATION (FCNBD). THESE ACTIONS WERE FILED IN 2000 AND ARE

PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS IN CHICAGO UNDER

THE GENERAL CAPTION, IN RE BANK ONE SECURITIES LITIGATION. THE CASES WERE FILED AFTER BANK ONES

EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER 1999 THAT LOWERED BANK ONES EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS

FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 1999. FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENTS, BANK ONES STOCK

PRICE HAD DROPPED BY 37.7% AS OF NOVEMBER 10, 1999.

TWO OF THESE CLASS ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT BY REPRESENTATIVES OF FCNBD SHAREHOLDERS AND BANC ONE

SHAREHOLDERS, RESPECTIVELY, ALLEGING CERTAIN MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS OF MATERIAL FACT

MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN FCNBD AND BANC ONE, WHICH WAS COMPLETED

IN OCTOBER 1998. THERE IS ALSO AN INDIVIDUAL LAWSUIT PROCEEDING

IN CONNECTION WITH THAT SAME MERGER. A THIRD CLASS ACTION WAS FILED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF

REPRESENTING SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST COMMERCE, ALLEGING CERTAIN MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS OF

MATERIAL FACT MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN BANC ONE AND FIRST COMMERCE, WHICH WAS

COMPLETED IN JUNE 1998. ALL OF THESE PLAINTIFF GROUPS CLAIM THAT AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS

MISSTATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS REGARDING PAYMENT PROCESSING ISSUES AT FIRST USA BANK, N.A., A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF BANC ONE, AND AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF VARIOUS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES,

THE PRICE OF BANC ONE COMMON STOCK WAS ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED, CAUSING THEIR SHAREHOLDERS TO ACQUIRE

SHARES OF THE BANK ONES COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER AT AN EXCHANGE RATE THAT WAS

ARTIFICIALLY DEFLATED. THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST BANK ONE AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ASSERT CLAIMS

UNDER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. FACT DISCOVERY, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, CLOSED IN DECEMBER 2003.

THE PARTIES ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF EXPERT DISCOVERY, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN THE SPRING

OF 2005.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW OF THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS

SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE

A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH

CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES OR PENALTIES RELATED

TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER

CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME

OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF

THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY

ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN

CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF

THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WITHIN THE 75-DAY PERIOD PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THIS REPORT, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

DESIGN AND OPERATION OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS

DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). SEE EXHIBITS 31.1,

31.2 AND 31.3 FOR THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF

OPERATING OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THE DESIGN AND

OPERATION OF THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE.

THE WORK UNDERTAKEN BY THE FIRM TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

INVOLVED THE IDENTIFICATION, DOCUMENTATION, ASSESSMENT AND TESTING OF

THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH CONTROLS. THE EVALUATION INCLUDED KEY

CONTROLS OF BANK ONE CORPORATION FROM THE DATE OF ITS ACQUISITION ON JULY 1, 2004.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY

NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN

CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME AND THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES  OR,

EVEN, MATERIAL WEAKNESSES  IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE. SEE PAGE 82 FOR MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND PAGE 83 FOR

THE REPORT OF THE FIRMS INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE

FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN

RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 THAT HAS MATERIALLY

AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE

(THE MERGER), PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

DATED JANUARY 14, 2004. AS A RESULT OF

THE MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF BANK ONE WAS CONVERTED IN A STOCK-FOR-STOCK

EXCHANGE INTO 1.32 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE PURCHASE PRICE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WAS $58.5 BILLION. KEY

OBJECTIVES OF THE MERGER WERE TO PROVIDE THE FIRM WITH A MORE BALANCED BUSINESS MIX AND GREATER

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

BANK ONES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2004.

THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECT SIX MONTHS

OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED FIRM AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE; THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR ALL OTHER PERIODS PRIOR TO 2004 REFLECT ONLY THE OPERATIONS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN

CHASE.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT COST SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION (PRE-TAX) WILL BE ACHIEVED BY THE

END OF 2007; APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE SAVINGS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE REALIZED BY THE END OF

2005. TOTAL 2004 MERGER SAVINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. MERGER COSTS TO COMBINE THE

IN $976 MILLION (PRE-TAX) OF CHARGES IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE CONFORMITY

CHARGES WERE COMPRISED OF A $1.4 BILLION (PRE-TAX) CHARGE RELATED TO THE DECERTIFICATION OF THE

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. 2003 REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

THE FIRMS RESULTS IN 2004 WERE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, BUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE

WERE THE MERGER, THE LITIGATION CHARGE TAKEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC

GROWTH.

THE FIRM REPORTED 2004 NET INCOME OF $4.5 BILLION, OR $1.55 PER SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF

$6.7 BILLION, OR $3.24 PER SHARE, FOR 2003. THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 6%, COMPARED WITH 16%

IN 2003. RESULTS INCLUDED $3.7 BILLION IN AFTER-TAX CHARGES, OR $1.31 PER SHARE, COMPRISED OF.

MERGER COSTS OF $846 MILLION; CHARGES TO CONFORM ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER OF

$605 MILLION; AND A CHARGE OF $2.3 BILLION TO INCREASE LITIGATION RESERVES. EXCLUDING THESE

CHARGES, OPERATING EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN $8.2 BILLION, OR $2.86 PER SHARE, AND RETURN ON COMMON

EQUITY WOULD HAVE BEEN 11%. OPERATING EARNINGS REPRESENT BUSINESS RESULTS WITHOUT THE

MERGER-RELATED COSTS AND THE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION CHARGES.

DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, THE FIRM DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF MERGER INTEGRATION AND

BEGAN TO EXECUTE ON THE PLAN. SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES DURING THE YEAR INCLUDED: BRANDING DECISIONS

FOR ALL BUSINESSES; MERGER OF THE HOLDING COMPANIES, LEAD BANKS AND CREDIT CARD BANKS; CONVERSION

OF THE BANK ONE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO TO A NEW PROCESSING PLATFORM; ANNOUNCEMENT OF INSOURCING OF

MAJOR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS; AND CONSOLIDATION AND STANDARDIZATION OF HUMAN RESOURCE POLICIES AND

BENEFIT PLANS. AS PART OF THE MERGER, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD TARGETED REDUCING OPERATING

EXPENSES BY $3.0 BILLION (PRE-TAX) BY THE END OF 2007. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE COST REDUCTIONS,

THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT EXPECTS TO INCUR MERGER COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION TO

$4.5 BILLION AND REDUCE ITS WORKFORCE BY APPROXIMATELY 12,000 OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD.

IN 2004, BOTH THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN OVERALL, EVEN THOUGH

MOMENTUM SLOWED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO RISING OIL PRICES. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

INCREASED BY 3.9% GLOBALLY AND 4.4% IN THE U.S., BOTH UP FROM 2003. THE U.S. ECONOMY EXPERIENCED

RISING SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, DRIVEN BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FRB) ACTIONS DURING

THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE INCREASED FROM 1.00% TO 2.25% DURING THE YEAR AND

THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED, AS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES WERE RELATIVELY STABLE. EQUITY MARKETS, BOTH

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, ENJOYED STRONG RESULTS, WITH THE S&P 500 UP 9% AND INTERNATIONAL

INDICES INCREASING IN SIMILAR FASHION. CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY DURING 2004 WAS HEALTHY, DEBT

UNDERWRITING WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE STRONG LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN 2003, AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING

ENJOYED STRONG AND CONSISTENT ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR. THE U.S. CONSUMER SECTOR SHOWED CONTINUED

STRENGTH BUOYED BY THE OVERALL ECONOMIC STRENGTH, DESPITE SLOWING MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND

REFINANCE ACTIVITY. RETAIL SALES WERE UP OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, AND BANKRUPTCY FILINGS WERE DOWN

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 2003.

ON AN OPERATING BASIS, NET INCOME IN EACH OF THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS WAS AFFECTED

PRIMARILY BY THE MERGER. THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS OTHER FACTORS WHICH AFFECTED

OPERATING RESULTS IN EACH BUSINESS.

DESPITE THE RELATIVELY BENEFICIAL CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, RESULTS FOR THE INVESTMENT BANK WERE

UNDER PRESSURE DURING THE YEAR. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE RELATED TO

LOWER FIXED INCOME TRADING, DRIVEN BY WEAKER PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT RESULTS, AND A

REDUCTION IN NET INTEREST INCOME, STEMMING PRIMARILY FROM LOWER LOAN BALANCES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES, THE RESULT OF CONTINUED STRENGTH IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, AND HIGHER ADVISORY FEES. THE

INVESTMENT BANK BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, AS EVIDENCED BY THE SIGNIFICANT DROP IN

NONPERFORMING LOANS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, RECOVERIES OF PREVIOUSLY CHARGED-OFF LOANS. EXPENSES

ROSE, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSES.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

BENEFITED FROM BETTER SPREADS EARNED ON DEPOSITS AND GROWTH IN RETAINED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

AND HOME EQUITY LOAN BALANCES. MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME WAS ALSO UP, REFLECTING HIGHER

MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION

INCOME RELATED TO THE SLOWER MORTGAGE ORIGINATION ACTIVITY. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

BENEFITED FROM IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY IN NEARLY ALL PORTFOLIOS AND A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF A $4 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO. HIGHER

COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE DUE TO CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE BRANCH OFFICE NETWORK, INCLUDING 130

NEW LOCATIONS (106 NET ADDITIONAL BRANCHES) OPENED DURING 2004 FOR THE COMBINED FIRM, AND EXPANSION OF THE SALES FORCE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY ONGOING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.

CARD SERVICES REVENUE BENEFITED FROM HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME, WHICH

INCREASED NET INTEREST INCOME AND HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY. EXPENSES

INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING AND HIGHER VOLUME-BASED PROCESSING EXPENSES.

COMMERCIAL BANKING REVENUES BENEFITED FROM STRONG DEPOSIT GROWTH AND HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING

FEES. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS, WHICH OFTEN

DECLINE WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE. CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, RESULTING IN LOWER NET

CHARGE-OFFS AND NONPERFORMING LOANS.

20

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES REVENUES BENEFITED FROM STRONG GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND

AVERAGE DEPOSITS, ALONG WITH DEPOSIT SPREADS, WHICH IMPROVED DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEPOSITS. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET BY LOWER SERVICE CHARGES ON

DEPOSITS, WHICH OFTEN DECLINE WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ALSO WERE AFFECTED BY

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME. EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO SOFTWARE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND LEGAL AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED EXPENSES.

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GLOBAL EQUITY

MARKETS, AN IMPROVED PRODUCT MIX, BETTER INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND NET ASSET INFLOWS. RESULTS

ALSO BENEFITED FROM DEPOSIT AND LOAN GROWTH.

THE CORPORATE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A REPOSITIONING OF THE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND TIGHTER SPREADS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED PRIVATE

EQUITY RESULTS DUE TO AN IMPROVED CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT SALES.

THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET WAS LIKEWISE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MERGER. ASIDE FROM THE

MERGER, THE FIRM TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS DURING THE YEAR TO STRENGTHEN THE BALANCE SHEET. NOTABLY,

THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS REPOSITIONED TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO RISING INTEREST RATES;

AUTO LEASING WAS DE-EMPHASIZED, AND LEASE RECEIVABLES WERE REDUCED BY 16% TO $8 BILLION; THE $4

BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO WAS SOLD; THE $2 BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PORTFOLIO

WAS SOLD SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END; A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIRD-PARTY PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

HAVE BEEN SOLD; AND THE FIRM INCREASED ITS LITIGATION RESERVES. THE FIRMS CAPITAL BASE WAS ALSO

SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED FOLLOWING THE MERGER. AS OF YEAR-END, TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS

$106 BILLION, AND THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO WAS 8.7%. THE CAPITAL POSITION ALLOWED THE FIRM TO

BEGIN REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WITH MORE THAN $700

MILLION, OR 19.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES, REPURCHASED DURING THE YEAR.

2005 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2005 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE INTEGRALLY LINKED TOGETHER.

WHILE THE FIRM CONSIDERS OUTCOMES FOR, AND HAS CONTINGENCY PLANS TO RESPOND TO, STRESS

ENVIRONMENTS, ITS BASIC OUTLOOK FOR 2005 IS PREDICATED ON THE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS IMPLIED IN

THE FORWARD RATE CURVE FOR U.S. TREASURIES, THE CONTINUATION OF THE FAVORABLE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS AND CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY CORRELATED TO OVERALL GLOBAL

ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE INVESTMENT BANK ENTERS 2005 WITH A STRONG PIPELINE FOR ADVISORY AND

UNDERWRITING BUSINESS, AND IT CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON GROWING ITS CLIENT-DRIVEN TRADING BUSINESS.

COMPARED WITH 2004, THE INVESTMENT BANK EXPECTS A REDUCTION IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES, AS BOTH

NET INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS AND GAINS FROM WORKOUTS ARE LIKELY TO DECREASE. FINANCIAL MARKET

MOVEMENTS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS ALSO AFFECT ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND TREASURY & SECURITIES

SERVICES. ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES REVENUE GROWTH, DRIVEN BY NET INFLOWS TO ASSETS

UNDER SUPERVISION AND BY THE HIGHBRIDGE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS DEPOSIT AND LOAN GROWTH. TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES ANTICIPATES MODEST REVENUE GROWTH, DUE TO WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSITS, AS WELL AS

INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME AND ACTIVITY IN THE CUSTODY, TRADE, COMMERCIAL CARD, AMERICAN DEPOSITARY

RECEIPT AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION BUSINESSES. COMMERCIAL BANKING ANTICIPATES THAT NET

REVENUES WILL BENEFIT FROM GROWTH IN TREASURY SERVICES AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, OFFSET BY

MARGIN COMPRESSION ON LOANS.

THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK VARIES FOR THE RESPECTIVE CONSUMER BUSINESSES. CARD SERVICES

ANTICIPATES MODEST GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND IN CARD OUTSTANDINGS. FOR RFS, HOME FINANCE

EARNINGS ARE LIKELY TO WEAKEN GIVEN A MARKET-DRIVEN DECLINE IN MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS, NEUTRALIZING

THE EXPECTED EARNINGS INCREASE IN CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING. THE DROP IN REVENUE AT HOME

FINANCE SHOULD BE MITIGATED BY ONGOING EFFORTS TO BRING EXPENSES IN LINE WITH LOWER

EXPECTED ORIGINATION VOLUMES. GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING,

WITH INCREASES IN CORE DEPOSITS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN

THE BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. NEW BRANCH OPENINGS SHOULD CONTINUE AT A PACE CONSISTENT WITH OR

SLIGHTLY ABOVE THOSE OF 2004. AT THE HERITAGE CHASE BRANCHES, EXPANDED HOURS AND REALIGNED

COMPENSATION PLANS THAT TIE INCENTIVES TO BRANCH PERFORMANCE ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE IMPROVEMENTS

IN PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREMENTAL NET REVENUE GROWTH. EARNINGS IN AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE ARE

EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE, GIVEN THE CURRENT COMPETITIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. ACROSS

ALL RFS BUSINESSES, CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS REMAIN STABLE, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CREDIT COSTS

LIKELY IN 2005.

THE CORPORATE SECTOR INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY, TREASURY AND THE CORPORATE SUPPORT UNITS. THE REVENUE

OUTLOOK FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF EQUITY MARKET

CONDITIONS IN 2005. IF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS PERSIST, THE FIRM ANTICIPATES CONTINUED

REALIZATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS; THE FIRM IS NOT ANTICIPATING INVESTMENT SECURITIES GAINS FROM

THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO IN 2005.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2005 IS ANTICIPATED TO BE HIGHER THAN IN 2004, DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY A RETURN TO A MORE NORMAL LEVEL OF PROVISIONING FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES OVER TIME. THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2005 SHOULD REFLECT

INCREASED BALANCES, WITH GENERALLY STABLE CREDIT QUALITY. THE FIRM PLANS TO IMPLEMENT

HIGHER MINIMUM-PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE CARD SERVICES BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2005; IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS WILL INCREASE DELINQUENCY AND NET CHARGE-OFF RATES, BUT THE

MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT IS CURRENTLY BEING ASSESSED.

THE FIRMS 2005 EXPENSES SHOULD REFLECT THE REALIZATION OF $1.5 BILLION IN MERGER SAVINGS. THESE

SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY A PROJECTED $1.1 BILLION OF INCREMENTAL SPENDING RELATED TO

FIRMWIDE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, DISTRIBUTION ENHANCEMENT, AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT AND

EXPANSION IN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, THE INVESTMENT BANK AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT. IN

ADDITION, EXPENSES WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS HIGHBRIDGE AND

CAZENOVE.

MANAGEMENT WILL SEEK TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET THROUGH RIGOROUS

FINANCIAL AND RISK DISCIPLINE. ANY CAPITAL GENERATED IN EXCESS OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL TARGETS, AND

BEYOND THAT REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ANTICIPATED MODEST GROWTH IN ASSETS AND THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RISK, WILL CREATE CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY IN 2005 WITH

RESPECT TO COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. ALL OTHER PERIODS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

TOTAL NET REVENUES, AT $43.1 BILLION, ROSE BY $9.7 BILLION OR 29%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER,

WHICH AFFECTED EVERY CATEGORY OF TOTAL NET REVENUE. ADDITIONAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

REVENUE GROWTH WERE HIGHER CONSUMER DEMAND FOR CREDIT PRODUCTS AND HIGHER CREDIT CARD CHARGE

VOLUME, AS WELL AS STRONG RETAIL AND WHOLESALE DEPOSIT GROWTH. INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES

INCREASED AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. REVENUE ALSO

BENEFITED FROM ACQUISITIONS AND GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY, UNDER MANAGEMENT AND UNDER

SUPERVISION, THE RESULT OF GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION AND NET ASSET INFLOWS. PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS WERE HIGHER DUE TO AN IMPROVED CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT SALES. THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS

HIGHLIGHTS FACTORS OTHER THAN THE MERGER THAT AFFECTED THE 2004 VERSUS 2003 COMPARISON.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. TRADING

REVENUE DECLINED BY 18%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN FIXED INCOME AND

EQUITIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND TRADING REVENUE, WHICH ARE

PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

30-32 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES WERE UP FROM 2003 DUE TO THE MERGER. THE RISE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS, AS CLIENTS PAID FOR SERVICES WITH DEPOSITS, VERSUS

FEES, DUE TO RISING INTEREST RATES. THROUGHOUT 2004, DEPOSIT BALANCES GREW IN RESPONSE TO

RISING INTEREST RATES.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THE FULL-YEAR

IMPACT OF OTHER ACQUISITIONS - SUCH AS EFS IN JANUARY 2004, BANK ONES CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS IN

NOVEMBER 2003 AND JPMORGAN

RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES IN JUNE 2003 - AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION,

NET ASSET INFLOWS AND A BETTER PRODUCT MIX. IN ADDITION, A MORE ACTIVE MARKET FOR TRADING

ACTIVITIES IN 2004 RESULTED IN HIGHER BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR AWM ON PAGES 45-46, TSS ON PAGES 43-44 AND

RFS ON PAGES 33-38 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS FOR 2004 ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY FUELED BY THE

IMPROVEMENT IN THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT RESULTS. THIS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER SECURITIES

GAINS ON THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUMES OF SECURITIES SOLD, AND

LOWER GAINS REALIZED ON SALES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES; ADDITIONALLY, RFSS HOME FINANCE

BUSINESS REPORTED LOSSES IN 2004 ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES, AS COMPARED WITH GAINS

IN 2003. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, SEE THE RFS AND CORPORATE SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 33-38 AND 47-48, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, SEE

THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 47-48 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SERVICING REVENUE; THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) ASSET RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS

AND PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE, AND LOWER GAINS FROM SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS OF SUBPRIME

LOANS AS A RESULT OF MANAGEMENTS DECISION IN 2004 TO RETAIN THESE LOANS. MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED

INCOME EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NII AND SECURITIES GAINS RELATED TO HOME MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS PRIMARILY RECORDED IN RFSS HOME FINANCE

BUSINESS, SEE THE HOME FINANCE DISCUSSION ON PAGES 34-36 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME INCREASED FROM 2003 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME, WHICH

RESULTED IN INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, AND HIGHER CREDIT CARD SERVICING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

INCREASE OF $19.4 BILLION IN AVERAGE SECURITIZED LOANS. THE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS AND REWARDS EXPENSE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT

CARD INCOME, SEE CSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 39-40 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME FROM 2003 REFLECTED GAINS ON LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHER

NET RESULTS FROM CORPORATE AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS IN 2004

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON SALES OF SEVERAL NONSTRATEGIC BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE

PROPERTIES IN 2003.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE FROM 2003 AS GROWTH IN VOLUMES OF CONSUMER LOANS AND DEPOSITS, AS WELL AS

WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSITS, CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME. THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER WHOLESALE LOAN BALANCES IN THE IB AND TIGHTER SPREADS ON LOANS, INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND

TRADING ASSETS STEMMING FROM THE RISE IN INTEREST RATES. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING

ASSETS FOR 2004 WERE $744.1 BILLION, UP $154.2 BILLION FROM 2003. GROWTH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY HIGHER

LEVELS OF CONSUMER LOANS. THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT

BASIS, WAS 2.27% IN 2004, AN INCREASE OF 6 BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

TOTAL REVENUE FOR 2003 WAS $33.4 BILLION, UP 13% FROM 2002. ALL BUSINESSES BENEFITED

FROM IMPROVED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 2003. IN PARTICULAR, THE LOW-INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT

DROVE ROBUST FIXED INCOME MARKETS AND AN UNPRECEDENTED MORTGAGE REFINANCING BOOM, WHICH DROVE THE

GROWTH IN REVENUE.

22

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES INCREASED BY $127 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN IBS

EQUITY UNDERWRITING, WHICH WAS UP 49%, REFLECTING INCREASES IN MARKET SHARE AND

UNDERWRITING VOLUMES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVISORY FEES REFLECTING

DEPRESSED LEVELS OF M&A ACTIVITY. TRADING REVENUE WAS UP $1.8 BILLION, OR 65%, PRIMARILY DUE TO

STRONG CLIENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REVENUE GROWTH IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS AS A

RESULT OF THE LOW-INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVEMENT IN EQUITY MARKETS AND VOLATILITY

IN CREDIT MARKETS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND TRADING REVENUE, WHICH

ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE INVESTMENT BANK, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 30-32 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES ROSE, THE RESULT OF HIGHER FEES ON STANDBY LETTERS OF

CREDIT, DUE TO GROWTH IN TRANSACTION VOLUME, AND HIGHER SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS. THESE CHARGES

WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE PAYMENT OF SERVICES WITH FEES, VERSUS DEPOSITS, DUE TO LOWER

INTEREST RATES.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A MORE

FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEBT AND EQUITY ACTIVITIES, RESULTING IN HIGHER FEES FOR THE CUSTODY,

INSTITUTIONAL TRUST, BROKERAGE AND OTHER PROCESSING-RELATED BUSINESSES. FEES FOR INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ALSO INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS IN AWM, BUT THESE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INSTITUTIONAL NET FUND OUTFLOWS, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER

AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.

SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS INCREASED TO $1.5 BILLION FROM $817 MILLION IN 2002, REFLECTING

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS

REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES IN TREASURY AND OF AFS SECURITIES IN RFSS HOME FINANCE

BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY INCREASING INTEREST RATES BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS (LOSSES), SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 47-48 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME DECLINED BY 7% IN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN REVENUE

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGEMENT OF THE MSR ASSET, MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE; THESE

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FEES FROM ORIGINATION AND SALES ACTIVITY AND OTHER FEES DERIVED

FROM VOLUME AND MARKET-SHARE GROWTH. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS

PRIMARILY RECORDED IN RFSS HOME FINANCE BUSINESS, SEE THE HOME FINANCE DISCUSSION ON PAGES

34-36 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CREDIT CARD SERVICING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE $6.7

BILLION GROWTH IN AVERAGE SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT

CARD INCOME, SEE CSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 39-40 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME ROSE, PRIMARILY FROM $200 MILLION IN GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN LOAN

WORKOUTS (COMPARED WITH $26 MILLION IN 2002), AS WELL AS GAINS ON THE SALE OF SEVERAL NONSTRATEGIC

BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES; THESE WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET RESULTS FROM CORPORATE

AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. IN ADDITION, 2002 INCLUDED $73 MILLION OF WRITE-DOWNS FOR

SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN INVESTMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME REFLECTED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON

CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS, SUCH AS MORTGAGES AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND LEASES AND RELATED FUNDING

COSTS. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS PARTIALLY REDUCED BY A LOWER VOLUME OF WHOLESALE LOANS AND LOWER

SPREADS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS IN 2003 WERE

$590 BILLION, UP 6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.21%, THE SAME AS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $2.5 BILLION WAS UP $1.0 BILLION, OR 65%, COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, AND OF ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY CHARGES OF $858 MILLION,

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RELEASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THE WHOLESALE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY IN THE IB. WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING LOANS

DECREASED BY 21% EVEN AFTER THE INCLUSION OF BANK ONES LOAN PORTFOLIO. RFSS PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE $4

BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO AND CONTINUED POSITIVE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS IN THE HOME

AND AUTO FINANCE BUSINESSES. THE PROVISION RELATED TO THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO GREW BY

$919 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE MERGER. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES AND THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, SEE THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

ON PAGES 57-69 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

THE 2003 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.8 BILLION LOWER THAN IN 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND A HIGHER VOLUME OF CREDIT

CARD SECURITIZATIONS.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $34.4 BILLION IN 2004, UP $12.5 BILLION, OR 57%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER. EXCLUDING $1.4 BILLION OF MERGER COSTS, AND LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES, NONINTEREST

EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN $29.3 BILLION, UP 35%. IN ADDITION TO THE MERGER AND LITIGATION CHARGES,

EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO REINVESTMENT IN THE LINES OF BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED

SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. EACH CATEGORY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS AFFECTED BY THE MERGER. THE

DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS OTHER FACTORS WHICH AFFECTED THE 2004 VERSUS 2003

COMPARISON.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS UP FROM 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE IB AND

CONTINUING EXPANSION IN RFS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONGOING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

AND MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM, AND A REDUCTION IN PENSION COSTS. THE DECLINE IN

PENSION COSTS WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FROM A

DISCRETIONARY $1.1 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIRMS PENSION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PLAN IN APRIL 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR 2004 COMPARED

WITH 2003. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS, SEE NOTE 6

ON PAGES 92-95 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER CHARGES FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE,

WHICH WERE $103 MILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $270 MILLION IN 2003.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE WAS HIGHER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE VENDORS, PRIMARILY IBM, TO SUPPORT THE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRM. AFTER THE MERGER, JPMORGAN CHASE DECIDED TO TERMINATE ITS OUTSOURCING

AGREEMENT WITH IBM, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE IBM

OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT, SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 47 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES ROSE DUE TO HIGHER LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PENDING LITIGATION

MATTERS, AS WELL AS OUTSIDE SERVICES STEMMING FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY EFS, AND GROWTH

IN BUSINESS AT TSS AND CS.

MARKETING EXPENSE ROSE AS CS INITIATED A MORE ROBUST MARKETING CAMPAIGN DURING 2004.

OTHER EXPENSE WAS UP DUE TO SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT WRITE-OFFS OF $224 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN TSS AND

CORPORATE, COMPARED WITH $60 MILLION IN 2003; HIGHER ACCRUALS FOR NON-ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION

CASES; AND THE IMPACT OF GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME. THESE WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $57 MILLION

SETTLEMENT RELATED TO THE ENRON SURETY BOND LITIGATION.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 15 AND NOTE

8 ON PAGES 109-111 AND 98, RESPECTIVELY.

IN JUNE OF 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDED A $3.7 BILLION (PRE-TAX) ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION

RESERVE. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, THE ADDITION REFLECTED

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE RESERVE LEVEL IN LIGHT OF ALL THEN-KNOWN

INFORMATION. BY COMPARISON, 2003 INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $100 MILLION FOR ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.8 BILLION, DOWN 4% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IN 2002, THE FIRM

RECORDED $1.3 BILLION OF CHARGES, PRINCIPALLY FOR ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION, AND $1.2 BILLION FOR

MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2002. EXCLUDING

THESE COSTS, EXPENSES ROSE BY 8% IN 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES,

INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES;

AND HIGHER OCCUPANCY EXPENSES. THE FIRM BEGAN EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS IN 2003.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED HIGHER PERFORMANCE-RELATED INCENTIVES,

AS WELL AS HIGHER PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES

IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. THE INCREASE PERTAINING TO INCENTIVES INCLUDED $266 MILLION AS A RESULT

OF ADOPTING SFAS 123, AND $120 MILLION FROM THE REVERSAL IN 2002 OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES FOR

CERTAIN FORFEITABLE KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS. TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES DECLINED AS A RESULT OF

THE TRANSFER, BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2003, OF 2,800 EMPLOYEES TO IBM IN CONNECTION WITH THE

AFOREMENTIONED TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE REFLECTED COSTS OF ADDITIONAL LEASED SPACE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN

AND IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, HIGHER REAL ESTATE TAXES IN NEW YORK

CITY AND THE COST OF ENHANCED

SAFETY MEASURES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE CHARGES FOR UNOCCUPIED EXCESS REAL ESTATE

OF $270 MILLION; THIS COMPARED WITH $120 MILLION IN 2002.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN EXPENSES: COSTS THAT

WERE PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH COMPENSATION AND OTHER EXPENSES SHIFTED, UPON THE COMMENCEMENT OF

THE IBM OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT, TO TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

INCREASE WERE HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE AMORTIZATION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE IBM

OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT, SEE CORPORATE ON PAGE 47 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES ROSE, REFLECTING GREATER UTILIZATION OF THIRD-PARTY VENDORS FOR

PROCESSING ACTIVITIES AND HIGHER LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS LITIGATION AND

BUSINESS-RELATED MATTERS.

HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY MORE ROBUST CAMPAIGNS FOR THE HOME FINANCE BUSINESS.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE WAS DUE PARTLY TO EXPENSE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCED

ALLOWANCES TO EXPATRIATES AND RECRUITMENT COSTS.

THERE WERE NO MERGER COSTS IN 2003. IN 2002, MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $1.2 BILLION WERE

FOR PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2002.

THE FIRM ADDED $100 MILLION TO THE ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION RESERVE IN 2003 TO SUPPLEMENT A $1.3

BILLION RESERVE INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2002. THE 2002 RESERVE WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER ENRON-RELATED

MATTERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER MATERIAL LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN WHICH THE

FIRM IS INVOLVED.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2004, AS COMPARED WITH 2003, WAS THE RESULT OF VARIOUS

FACTORS, INCLUDING LOWER REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME, A HIGHER LEVEL OF BUSINESS TAX CREDITS, AND

CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. THE MERGER COSTS AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN 2004, AND THE LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGE

RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, REFLECTED A TAX BENEFIT AT A 38% MARGINAL TAX RATE,

CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH 2003.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECLINE WAS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME

SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR

ON PAGES 84-87 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED BASIS,

PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE CONSISTENTLY TRACKED

FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S.

GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS

LINE-OF-BUSINESS RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.

THE DEFINITION OF OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. IN THE CASE OF THE

IB, OPERATING BASIS NONINTEREST REVENUE INCLUDES, IN TRADING REVENUE, NET INTEREST INCOME RELATED

TO TRADING ACTIVITIES. TRADING ACTIVITIES GENERATE REVENUES, WHICH ARE RECORDED FOR U.S. GAAP

PURPOSES IN TWO LINE ITEMS ON THE INCOME STATEMENT: TRADING REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES THE

MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES ON TRADING POSITIONS, AND NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH INCLUDES THE

INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE RELATED TO THOSE POSITIONS. COMBINING BOTH THE TRADING REVENUE AND

RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME ENABLES MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE IBS TRADING ACTIVITIES, BY

CONSIDERING ALL REVENUE RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES, AND FACILITATES OPERATING COMPARISONS TO OTHER

COMPETITORS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECLASSIFIES THE FIRMS TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME TO

TRADING REVENUE.

(B)

REFLECTS TRADING REVENUE AT THE FIRM LEVEL. THE MAJORITY OF TRADING REVENUE IS

RECORDED IN

THE INVESTMENT BANK.

IN ADDITION, SEGMENT RESULTS

REFLECT REVENUES ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. THE TAX-EQUIVALENT

GROSS-UP FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS BASED UPON THE LEVEL, TYPE AND

TAX JURISDICTION OF THE EARNINGS AND ASSETS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT. OPERATING REVENUE FOR THE INVESTMENT BANK

INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR INCOME TAX CREDITS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS

TAX-EXEMPT INCOME FROM MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS. INFORMATION PRIOR

TO THE MERGER HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM WITH THIS NEW

PRESENTATION. THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX-EQUIVALENT GROSS-UP FOR EACH

BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ELIMINATED WITHIN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRADING-RELATED REVENUE AND TAX-EQUIVALENT

ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO OPERATING REVENUE, SEE THE IB ON PAGES 30-32 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE CASE OF CARD SERVICES, OPERATING OR MANAGED BASIS EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS ON REVENUE, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND LOAN RECEIVABLES.

THROUGH SECURITIZATION THE FIRM TRANSFORMS A PORTION OF ITS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INTO

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ARE REMOVED FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THROUGH THE TRANSFER OF PRINCIPAL CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST,

AND THE SALE OF UNDIVIDED INTERESTS TO INVESTORS THAT ENTITLE THE INVESTORS TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS

GENERATED FROM THE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. THE FIRM RETAINS THE REMAINING UNDIVIDED INTERESTS AS

SELLERS INTERESTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. A GAIN OR LOSS

ON THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO INVESTORS IS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME. SECURITIZATION

ALSO AFFECTS THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT BY RECLASSIFYING AS CREDIT CARD INCOME,

INTEREST INCOME, CERTAIN FEE REVENUE, AND RECOVERIES IN EXCESS OF INTEREST PAID TO THE INVESTORS,

GROSS CREDIT LOSSES AND OTHER TRUST EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES. FOR A

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS OF CARD SERVICES RESULTS,

SEE PAGE 40 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING LOANS AND RESIDUAL INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 13 ON

PAGES 103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED RECEIVABLES TO

EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD

LOANS, BOTH SOLD AND NOT SOLD; AS THE SAME BORROWER IS CONTINUING TO USE THE CREDIT CARD FOR

ONGOING CHARGES, A BORROWERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE LOAN RECEIVABLES SOLD

UNDER SFAS 140 AND THOSE NOT SOLD. THUS, IN ITS DISCLOSURES REGARDING MANAGED LOAN RECEIVABLES,

JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN ORDER TO

DISCLOSE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE (SUCH AS NET CHARGE-OFF RATES) OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, CARD SERVICES OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED, OPERATING RESULTS ARE EVALUATED AND

DECISIONS ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL ARE BASED ON MANAGED FINANCIAL

INFORMATION.

FINALLY, OPERATING BASIS EXCLUDES MERGER COSTS, THE LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGE AND ACCOUNTING POLICY

CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE ITEMS ARE NOT PART OF

THE FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS (AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF TRENDS) AND DO

NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PERIODS.

MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FACILITATE A COMPARISON

OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPETITORS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING WAS REALIGNED TO REFLECT THE

NEW BUSINESS STRUCTURE OF THE COMBINED FIRM. TREASURY WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE IB INTO

CORPORATE. THE SEGMENT FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN COMPRISED OF CHASE HOME

FINANCE, CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES, CHASE AUTO FINANCE, CHASE REGIONAL BANKING AND CHASE MIDDLE

MARKET; AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS SEGMENT IS NOW CALLED RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND IS

COMPRISED OF HOME FINANCE, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE, CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING AND

INSURANCE. CHASE MIDDLE MARKET MOVED INTO COMMERCIAL BANKING, AND CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES

IS NOW ITS OWN SEGMENT CALLED CARD SERVICES. TSS REMAINS UNCHANGED. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE

BANKING HAS BEEN RENAMED ASSET &

WEALTH MANAGEMENT. JPMORGAN PARTNERS, WHICH FORMERLY WAS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, WAS MOVED

INTO CORPORATE. CORPORATE IS CURRENTLY COMPRISED OF PRIVATE EQUITY (JPMORGAN PARTNERS

AND ONE EQUITY PARTNERS), TREASURY, AS WELL AS CORPORATE SUPPORT AREAS, WHICH INCLUDE CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS, INTERNAL AUDIT, EXECUTIVE OFFICE, FINANCE, GENERAL SERVICES, HUMAN

RESOURCES, MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE GENERAL

EFFECTIVE WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, GOODWILL, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATED CAPITAL, IS ONLY

ALLOCATED

TO THE CORPORATE LINE OF BUSINESS. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THESE NEW

METHODOLOGIES AND ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PRESENTATION BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY

A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES THESE RESULTS ALLOCATES

INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, SEVERAL OF THE

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES WERE REVISED, AS NOTED BELOW. THE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2004.

AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THESE NEW METHODOLOGIES, THEY ARE NOT COMPARABLE

TO THE PRESENTATION OF PERIODS BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. FURTHER, THE FIRM INTENDS

TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING RECLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR

SEGMENT REPORTING, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN

FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUES FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THESE REVENUE

SHARING AGREEMENTS WERE REVISED ON THE MERGER DATE TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE LINES

OF BUSINESSES.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING (FTP) IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE TO EACH

LINE OF BUSINESS AND ALSO SERVES TO TRANSFER INTEREST RATE RISK TO CORPORATE. WHILE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY PERIODICALLY RETAIN INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES RELATED TO CUSTOMER PRICING

OR OTHER BUSINESS-SPECIFIC RISKS, THE BALANCE OF THE FIRMS OVERALL INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IS

INCLUDED AND MANAGED IN CORPORATE. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, FTP WAS REVISED TO CONFORM THE

POLICIES OF THE COMBINED FIRMS.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF

THOSE SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THOSE EXPENSES ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON

THEIR ACTUAL COST, OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR MARKET COST, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE

SERVICES PROVIDED. EFFECTIVE

WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES OF THE HERITAGE FIRMS WERE

ALIGNED TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, EXPENSES RELATED TO

CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS CEASED TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. THESE RETAINED EXPENSES INCLUDE PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT

WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN

CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS

NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER COMPARISONS,

ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO EACH

BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. EFFECTIVE WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, NEW METHODOLOGIES WERE

IMPLEMENTED TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO EACH SEGMENT. AS PART OF THE NEW

METHODOLOGY, GOODWILL, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATED CAPITAL, IS ALLOCATED SOLELY TO CORPORATE.

ALTHOUGH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THE ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT

TESTING (SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 109 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT), THE FIRM HAS ELECTED NOT TO INCLUDE

GOODWILL OR THE RELATED CAPITAL IN EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SECTION ON PAGE 50 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

EQUITY FRAMEWORK.

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES THE IB MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS THE

SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS REVISED TO BE BASED ON

PRE-TAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE EXPOSURES. PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED ON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, PLUS THE ALLOCATED CAPITAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE

SHARED CLIENTS.

TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS

SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT REVENUES ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES. REFER TO PAGE 25 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR

TRADING REVENUE, ON A REPORTED BASIS, EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NET INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO

IBS TRADING ACTIVITIES; THIS INCOME IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME. HOWEVER, IN THIS

PRESENTATION, TO ASSESS THE PROFITABILITY OF IBS TRADING BUSINESS, THE FIRM COMBINES THESE

REVENUES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. THE AMOUNT RECLASSIFIED FROM NET INTEREST INCOME TO

TRADING

REVENUE WAS $1.9 BILLION, $2.1 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

(C)

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX-EXEMPT INCOME

FROM MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS, AND INCOME TAX CREDITS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS

(D)

TSS IS CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES MANAGED WITHIN THE IB CREDIT

PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT

ON PAGE 29 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

IN 2004, OPERATING EARNINGS OF $2.9 BILLION WERE UP 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INCREASES IN INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES, A REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN TRADING REVENUES AND NET INTEREST INCOME. RETURN ON EQUITY WAS

17%.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $12.6 BILLION WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUES AND TOTAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES, OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM FIXED INCOME

MARKETS WAS DRIVEN BY WEAKER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TRADING RESULTS, MAINLY IN THE INTEREST RATE

MARKETS BUSINESS. TOTAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES WERE DOWN DUE TO LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME AND

LENDING FEES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER LOAN BALANCES; THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

TRADING REVENUE DUE TO MORE SEVERE CREDIT SPREAD TIGHTENING IN 2003 RELATIVE TO 2004. INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES INCREASED BY 24% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ADVISORY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING. THE ADVISORY GAINS WERE A RESULT OF INCREASED GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES AND MARKET SHARE,

WHILE THE HIGHER UNDERWRITING FEES WERE DUE TO STRONGER CLIENT ACTIVITY.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $640 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $181

MILLION IN 2003. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROVISION WAS THE RESULT OF A $633 MILLION DECLINE IN NET

CHARGE-OFFS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2004

RELATIVE TO 2003. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 57-69 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS UP 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE FROM 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND

THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $2.8 BILLION WERE UP SIGNIFICANTLY OVER 2002. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS WAS

DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, COUPLED WITH STRONG GROWTH IN

FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $12.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.0 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOW

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVEMENT IN EQUITY MARKETS AND VOLATILITY IN CREDIT MARKETS PRODUCED

INCREASED CLIENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT REVENUE IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES. MARKET SHARE GAINS

IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OVER 2002.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $181 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH A COST OF $2.4

BILLION IN 2002, REFLECTING IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY OF THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO

AND THE RESTRUCTURING OF SEVERAL NONPERFORMING WHOLESALE LOANS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY 6% FROM 2002, REFLECTING HIGHER INCENTIVES RELATED TO IMPROVED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE IMPACT OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS. NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE UP

10% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. ALL OTHER PERIODS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $2.2 BILLION, UP FROM $1.5 BILLION A YEAR AGO. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE

TO THE MERGER. EXCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF THE MERGER, EARNINGS DECLINED AS LOWER MSR RISK MANAGEMENT

RESULTS AND REDUCED PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE OFFSET THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH IN LOAN

BALANCES, WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT COSTS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED TO $10.8 BILLION, UP 45% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME

INCREASED BY 48% TO $7.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, GROWTH IN RETAINED LOAN BALANCES AND

WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED TO $3.1 BILLION, UP 39%, DUE TO

THE MERGER AND HIGHER MORTGAGE SERVICING INCOME. BOTH COMPONENTS OF TOTAL REVENUE INCLUDED DECLINES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGING THE MSR ASSET AND LOWER PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS DOWN 14% TO $449 MILLION, DESPITE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MERGER.

THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER WAS OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, RESULTING FROM

THE SALE OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND CONTINUED POSITIVE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS IN

THE CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED $6.8 BILLION, UP 53% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER

AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND THE BRANCH NETWORK. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE WERE

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSE SAVINGS IN ALL BUSINESSES.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $7.4 BILLION IN 2003, AN INCREASE OF 17% OVER 2002. NET INTEREST INCOME

INCREASED BY 37% TO $5.2 BILLION, REFLECTING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE LOW INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT ON CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN HOME FINANCE, AND ON SPREADS EARNED ON

RETAINED LOANS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $521 MILLION INCREASED BY 56% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE

TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIOS. CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STABLE IN 2003, AS

CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED SLIGHTLY, TO $381 MILLION.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE ROSE 20% TO $4.5 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES AND

COMPENSATION COSTS.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE PRIME PRODUCTION & SERVICING SEGMENT DROPPED TO $240 MILLION FROM $918

MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS REFLECTED A DECREASE IN PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE, TO

$728 MILLION FROM $1.3 BILLION, DUE TO A DECLINE IN MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. OPERATING EARNINGS WERE

ALSO IMPACTED BY A DROP IN MSR RISK MANAGEMENT REVENUE, TO $113 MILLION FROM $784 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS IN 2004 INCLUDED REALIZED LOSSES OF $89 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AFS SECURITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGEMENT OF THE MSR ASSET, COMPARED WITH SECURITIES GAINS OF $359 MILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT $1.1 BILLION.

34

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING SEGMENT MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $881 MILLION

FROM $414 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF THE BANK ONE

HOME EQUITY LENDING BUSINESS BUT ALSO REFLECTED GROWTH IN RETAINED LOAN BALANCES AND A $95 MILLION

NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE $4 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO; PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE LOWER SUBPRIME MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION GAINS. THESE FACTORS

CONTRIBUTED TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RISING 61% TO $2.4 BILLION. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AT

$74 MILLION, DECREASED BY 69% FROM A YEAR AGO. THIS WAS THE RESULT OF AN $87 MILLION REDUCTION IN

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO SALE, IMPROVED

CREDIT QUALITY AND LOWER DELINQUENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE MERGER. NONINTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED

$922 MILLION, UP 52% FROM THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, LARGELY DUE TO THE MERGER.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

HOME FINANCE ACHIEVED RECORD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2003, AS OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.3 BILLION

INCREASED BY 48% FROM 2002.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $4.0 BILLION INCREASED BY 39% OVER 2002, GIVEN RECORD PRODUCTION REVENUE,

IMPROVED MARGINS AND HIGHER HOME EQUITY REVENUE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $240 MILLION FOR 2003 INCREASED BY 26% OVER 2002, PRIMARILY DUE

TO HIGHER RETAINED LOAN BALANCES. CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUED TO BE STRONG RELATIVE TO 2002, AS

EVIDENCED BY A LOWER NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO AND REDUCED DELINQUENCIES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.7 BILLION INCREASED BY 29% FROM 2002, PRIMARILY A RESULT OF GROWTH IN

ORIGINATION VOLUME. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES WAS ALSO A RESULT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE-RELATED

INCENTIVES AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS MADE TO FURTHER EXPAND CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTION-RELATED EXPENSE REDUCTION EFFORTS INITIATED IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003.

(C)

INCLUDES GAINS, LOSSES AND INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES BOTH DESIGNATED AND NOT

DESIGNATED AS A SFAS 133 HEDGE, AND SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS BOTH TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

HOME FINANCE USES A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES, AFS SECURITIES AND TRADING SECURITIES TO MANAGE

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET. THESE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE INTENDED TO

PROTECT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY PROVIDING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS USED IN THIS RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY CHANGE OVER TIME AS MARKET CONDITIONS AND APPROACH DICTATE.

DURING 2004, NEGATIVE MSR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $248 MILLION WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $361

MILLION OF AGGREGATE RISK MANAGEMENT GAINS, INCLUDING NET INTEREST EARNED ON AFS SECURITIES. IN

2003, NEGATIVE MSR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $253 MILLION WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $1.0 BILLION OF

AGGREGATE RISK MANAGEMENT GAINS, INCLUDING NET INTEREST EARNED ON AFS SECURITIES. UNREALIZED

GAINS/(LOSSES) ON AFS SECURITIES WERE $(3) MILLION, $(144) MILLION AND $377 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSRS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS TOTALED $760 MILLION, UP FROM A LOSS OF $4 MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE

INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSITS AND LOWER

EXPENSES. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $5.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WHILE THE

INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER, TOTAL NET REVENUE ALSO BENEFITED FROM WIDER

SPREADS ON DEPOSITS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED TO $165 MILLION FROM $76 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS IN PART DUE TO THE MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES TO COVER HIGH-RISK PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE TO $4.0 BILLION WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER.

INCREMENTAL EXPENSE FROM INVESTMENTS IN THE BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING

FACTOR.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $2.4 BILLION DECREASED BY 9% COMPARED WITH 2002. NET INTEREST INCOME

DECLINED BY 10% TO $1.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOW-INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. NONINTEREST

REVENUE DECREASED BY 5% TO $828 MILLION GIVEN LOWER DEPOSIT FEE INCOME, DECREASED DEBIT CARD FEES

AND ONE-TIME GAINS IN 2002.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $2.4 BILLION INCREASED BY 15% FROM 2002. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO

INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE BRANCH NETWORK AND HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO

INCREASED STAFF LEVELS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $76 MILLION INCREASED BY $107 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2002. THIS

REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2002.

OPERATING EARNINGS TOTALED $270 MILLION, UP 31% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. WHILE THE INCREASE WAS

REFLECTIVE OF THE MERGER, PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR WAS MODERATED BY NARROWER SPREADS AND REDUCED

ORIGINATION VOLUMES ARISING FROM A COMPETITIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 36% TO $1.1 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE REFLECTED THE

MERGER BUT INCLUDED A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME, GIVEN THE COMPETITIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

IN 2004 AND INCREMENTAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS LEASE RESIDUAL EXPOSURE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED $210 MILLION, UP 2% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS

DUE TO THE MERGER BUT WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, REFLECTING

FAVORABLE CREDIT TRENDS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY 68% TO $490 MILLION, LARGELY DUE TO THE MERGER.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

IN 2003, OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $206 MILLION, 24% HIGHER THAN IN 2002. TOTAL NET REVENUE GREW BY

23% TO $842 MILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME GREW BY 33% IN COMPARISON TO 2002, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

AVERAGE LOANS AND LEASES OUTSTANDING AND WIDER SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED BY 18% TO $205 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A 32%

INCREASE IN AVERAGE LOAN AND LEASE RECEIVABLES. CREDIT QUALITY CONTINUED TO BE STRONG RELATIVE TO

2002, AS EVIDENCED BY A LOWER NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO AND A REDUCED DELINQUENCY RATE.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $291 MILLION INCREASED BY 18% COMPARED WITH 2002. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES

WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER ORIGINATION VOLUME AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARD SERVICES

CARD SERVICES IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH

APPROXIMATELY 94 MILLION CARDS IN CIRCULATION, AND IS THE LARGEST MERCHANT ACQUIRER. CS OFFERS A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF ITS CARDMEMBERS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED ON BEHALF

OF MANY WELL-KNOWN PARTNERS, SUCH AS MAJOR AIRLINES, HOTELS, UNIVERSITIES, RETAILERS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED RECEIVABLES TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE

UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD LOANS, BOTH SOLD AND NOT SOLD: AS THE SAME BORROWER IS CONTINUING TO USE THE

CREDIT CARD FOR ONGOING CHARGES, A BORROWERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE RECEIVABLES

SOLD UNDER SFAS 140 AND THOSE NOT SOLD. THUS, IN ITS DISCLOSURES REGARDING MANAGED RECEIVABLES,

JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN ORDER TO

DISCLOSE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE (SUCH AS NET CHARGE-OFF RATES) OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO. OPERATING RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON REVENUE, THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND RECEIVABLES. SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE

REPORTED NET INCOME VERSUS OPERATING EARNINGS; HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.3 BILLION INCREASED BY $591 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND CHARGE

VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER EXPENSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $10.7 BILLION INCREASED BY $4.6 BILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $8.4 BILLION

INCREASED BY $3.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER LOAN BALANCES. NONINTEREST

REVENUE OF $2.4 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER CHARGE

VOLUME, WHICH GENERATED INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, REFLECTING THE SHARING OF INCOME AND INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $4.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.9 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER AND GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. CREDIT RATIOS REMAINED STRONG,

BENEFITING FROM REDUCED CONTRACTUAL AND BANKRUPTCY CHARGE-OFFS. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO WAS 5.27%.

THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATIO WAS 3.70%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $3.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES AND VOLUME-BASED PROCESSING EXPENSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSES.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $683 MILLION INCREASED BY $19 MILLION OR 3% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

AND EXPENSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $6.1 BILLION INCREASED BY 4%. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $5.1 BILLION INCREASED BY

2% DUE TO HIGHER SPREAD AND LOAN BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $1.1 BILLION INCREASED BY 11% DUE

TO HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME, WHICH GENERATED INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER REWARDS EXPENSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 6%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER LOSSES DUE TO LOAN GROWTH. CONSERVATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND

RIGOROUS COLLECTION PRACTICES CONTRIBUTED TO STABLE CREDIT QUALITY.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 2%, DUE TO VOLUME-BASED PROCESSING EXPENSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DISCIPLINED EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

COMMERCIAL BANKING SERVES MORE THAN 25,000 CORPORATIONS, MUNICIPALITIES, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES, WITH ANNUAL REVENUES GENERALLY RANGING FROM $10 MILLION TO $2 BILLION. A

LOCAL MARKET PRESENCE AND A STRONG CUSTOMER SERVICE MODEL, COUPLED WITH A FOCUS ON RISK MANAGEMENT,

PROVIDE A SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COMMERCIAL BANKING TO PROVIDE THE FIRMS COMPLETE PRODUCT SET 

LENDING, TREASURY SERVICES, INVESTMENT BANKING AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  FOR BOTH CORPORATE

CLIENTS AND THEIR EXECUTIVES. COMMERCIAL BANKINGS CLIENTS BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THE FIRMS

EXTENSIVE BRANCH NETWORK AND OFTEN USE THE FIRM EXCLUSIVELY TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICES NEEDS.

COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATES IN 10 OF THE TOP 15 MAJOR U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. WITHIN THIS NETWORK,

COMMERCIAL BANKING IS DIVIDED INTO THREE CUSTOMER COVERAGE SEGMENTS. GENERAL COVERAGE FOR CORPORATE

CLIENTS IS DONE BY MIDDLE MARKET BANKING, WHICH GENERALLY COVERS CLIENTS UP TO $500 MILLION, AND

CORPORATE BANKING, WHICH GENERALLY COVERS CLIENTS OVER $500 MILLION. CORPORATE BANKING TYPICALLY

FOCUSES ON CLIENTS THAT HAVE BROADER INVESTMENT BANKING NEEDS. THE THIRD SEGMENT, COMMERCIAL REAL

ESTATE, SERVES INVESTORS IN AND DEVELOPERS OF FOR-SALE HOUSING, MULTIFAMILY RENTAL, RETAIL, OFFICE

AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE CUSTOMER GROUPINGS, COMMERCIAL BANKING OFFERS

SEVERAL PRODUCTS TO THE FIRMS ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE. CHASE BUSINESS CREDIT IS A LEADING NATIONAL

PROVIDER OF HIGHLY STRUCTURED ASSET-BASED FINANCING, SYNDICATIONS AND COLLATERAL ANALYSIS. CHASE

EQUIPMENT LEASING FINANCES A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT TYPES AND OFFERS VENDOR PROGRAMS FOR LEADING

CAPITAL AND TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. GIVEN THIS STRUCTURE, COMMERCIAL BANKING MANAGES A

CUSTOMER BASE AND LOAN PORTFOLIO THAT IS HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND

GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS.

COMMERCIAL BANKING WAS KNOWN PRIOR TO THE MERGER AS CHASE MIDDLE MARKET AND WAS A BUSINESS WITHIN

THE FORMER CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $608 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 98%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $2.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 76%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION TO

THE OVERALL INCREASE RELATED TO THE MERGER, NET INTEREST INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION WAS POSITIVELY

AFFECTED BY HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LENDING-RELATED REVENUE. NONINTEREST

REVENUE OF $682 MILLION WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND HIGHER GAINS

ON THE SALE OF LOANS AND SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN SATISFACTION OF DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS, WHICH OFTEN DECLINE AS INTEREST RATES RISE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $41 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $35 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, THE PROVISION WAS HIGHER IN 2004. LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS

IN 2004 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2004

RELATIVE TO 2003.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $521 MILLION, OR 63%, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

MERGER.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION DECREASED BY 1% COMPARED WITH 2002. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $1.0

SPREADS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $393

MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 7%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $6 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $66 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED FROM A

LARGER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2003, REFLECTING

AN IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $822 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 2% COMPARED WITH 2002. THE INCREASE WAS THE

RESULT OF HIGHER SEVERANCE COSTS AND PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE

IN OTHER EXPENSES.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR WERE $440 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $18 MILLION, OR 4%. RESULTS IN

2004 INCLUDE AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $10 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTOR SERVICES BUSINESS.

PRIOR-YEAR RESULTS INCLUDE AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $22 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL TRUST

SERVICES BUSINESS. EXCLUDING THESE ONE-TIME GAINS, OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $30 MILLION, OR

8%. BOTH NET REVENUE AND NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE

ACQUISITION OF BANK ONES CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2003 AND THE ACQUISITION OF EFS IN

JANUARY 2004.

TSS NET REVENUE IMPROVED BY 35% TO $4.9 BILLION. THIS REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE BENEFIT OF THE

MERGER AND THE ACQUISITIONS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVED PRODUCT REVENUES ACROSS TSS. NET INTEREST

INCOME GREW TO $1.4 BILLION FROM $947 MILLION AS A RESULT OF AVERAGE DEPOSIT BALANCE GROWTH OF 44%,

TO $128 BILLION, A CHANGE IN THE CORPORATE DEPOSIT PRICING METHODOLOGY IN 2004 AND WIDER DEPOSIT

SPREADS. GROWTH IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS WAS DRIVEN BY A 20% INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY TO

$9.1 TRILLION AS WELL AS NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN TRADE, COMMERCIAL CARD, GLOBAL EQUITY PRODUCTS,

SECURITIES LENDING, FUND SERVICES, CLEARING AND ACH. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE

LOWER SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS, WHICH OFTEN DECLINE AS INTEREST RATES RISE, AND A SOFT MUNICIPAL

BOND MARKET.

TREASURY SERVICES

(TS) NET REVENUE GREW TO $2.0 BILLION, INVESTOR

SERVICES (IS) TO $1.7 BILLION AND

INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES (ITS) TO $1.2 BILLION. TSS FIRMWIDE NET REVENUE GREW 41% TO $6.5 BILLION.

TSS FIRMWIDE NET REVENUES INCLUDE TREASURY SERVICES NET REVENUES RECORDED IN OTHER LINES OF

BUSINESS.

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT TO THE INVESTMENT BANK WAS $90 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A CREDIT FROM THE

INVESTMENT BANK OF $36 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE MERGER AND A CHANGE IN

METHODOLOGY. TSS IS CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES MANAGED WITHIN THE

INVESTMENT BANK CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED $4.1 BILLION, UP FROM $3.0 BILLION, REFLECTING THE MERGER AND THE

ACQUISITIONS NOTED ABOVE, $155 MILLION OF SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, UPFRONT TRANSITION EXPENSES

RELATED TO ON-BOARDING NEW CUSTODY AND FUND ACCOUNTING CLIENTS, AND LEGAL AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED

EXPENSES.

ON JANUARY 7, 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE AGREED TO ACQUIRE VASTERA, A PROVIDER OF GLOBAL TRADE MANAGEMENT

SOLUTIONS, FOR A TOTAL TRANSACTION VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $129 MILLION. VASTERAS BUSINESS WILL BE

COMBINED WITH THE LOGISTICS AND TRADE SERVICES BUSINESSES OF THE TREASURY SERVICES UNIT. THE

TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

TSS OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY 23% FROM 2002 WHILE DELIVERING A RETURN ON ALLOCATED CAPITAL OF

15%. A 9% INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND A LOWER CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT CONTRIBUTED TO

THE LOWER EARNINGS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 2%, WITH GROWTH AT ITS OF 11%. ITS REVENUE GROWTH WAS THE RESULT OF

DEBT PRODUCT LINES, INCREASED VOLUME IN ASSET SERVICING, A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $36 MILLION ON THE SALE

OF AN INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES BUSINESS IN 2003, AND THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS WHICH

GENERATED $29 MILLION OF NEW REVENUE IN 2003. TSS REVENUE ROSE BY 8% ON HIGHER TRADE AND

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

HIGHER BALANCE-DEFICIENCY FEES RESULTING FROM THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. ISS REVENUE

CONTRACTED BY 7%, THE RESULT OF LOWER NII DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES, LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

SECURITIES LENDING REVENUE, AND A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $50 MILLION ON THE SALE OF THE FIRMS INTEREST IN

A NON-U.S. SECURITIES CLEARING FIRM IN 2002.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY 9%, ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SEVERANCE, THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS,

THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH EXPENSING OF OPTIONS, INCREASED PENSION COSTS AND CHARGES TO PROVIDE FOR

LOSSES ON SUBLETTING UNOCCUPIED EXCESS REAL ESTATE.

TSS WAS ASSIGNED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS AND THE ASSOCIATED CAPITAL

RELATED TO CERTAIN CREDIT EXPOSURES MANAGED WITHIN IBS CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS

PRE-TAX MARGIN REPRESENTS OPERATING EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES / TOTAL NET REVENUE, WHICH IS

A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF PRE-TAX PERFORMANCE AND IS ANOTHER BASIS BY WHICH AWM MANAGEMENT

EVALUATES ITS PERFORMANCE AND THAT OF ITS COMPETITORS. PRE-TAX MARGIN IS AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE OF

AWMS EARNINGS, AFTER ALL COSTS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $681 MILLION, UP 137% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE LARGELY TO THE MERGER BUT

ALSO DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES; THESE WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $4.2 BILLION, UP 41%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. ADDITIONALLY, FEES AND

COMMISSIONS INCREASED DUE TO GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION, NET ASSET INFLOWS AND THE

ACQUISITION OF JPMORGAN RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES (RPS) IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003. FEES AND

COMMISSIONS ALSO INCREASED DUE TO AN IMPROVED PRODUCT MIX, WITH AN INCREASED PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS

IN HIGHER-YIELDING PRODUCTS. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO DEPOSIT AND LOAN GROWTH.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $14 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $49 MILLION, DUE TO AN

IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $3.1 BILLION, UP 26%, DUE TO THE MERGER AS WELL AS INCREASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE AND THE IMPACT OF INCREASED TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING INITIATIVES.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $287 MILLION, UP 3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN IMPROVED CREDIT

PORTFOLIO, THE BENEFIT OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER REVENUES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE FIRM

ACQUIRED AMERICAN CENTURY RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES INC., A PROVIDER OF DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

RECORDKEEPING SERVICES, AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY TO GROW ITS U.S. RETAIL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS WAS RENAMED JPMORGAN RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES (RPS).

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $3.0 BILLION, UP 1% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN FEES AND COMMISSIONS

REFLECTED THE ACQUISITION OF RPS AND INCREASED AVERAGE EQUITY MARKET VALUATIONS IN CLIENT

PORTFOLIOS, PARTLY OFFSET BY INSTITUTIONAL NET OUTFLOWS. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO

HIGHER BROKERAGE ACCOUNT BALANCES AND SPREADS. THE DECLINE IN OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED

NON-RECURRING ITEMS IN 2002.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED BY 59%, DUE TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY AND

RECOVERIES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.5 BILLION, UP $78 MILLION FROM 2002, REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF RPS,

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND REAL ESTATE AND SOFTWARE WRITE-OFFS, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE

CONTINUED IMPACT OF EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION (AUS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE $1.3 TRILLION, UP 66% FROM 2003, AND

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (AUM) WERE $791 BILLION, UP 41% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASES WERE

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE MERGER, AS WELL AS MARKET APPRECIATION, NET ASSET INFLOWS AND THE

ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THE FIRM ALSO HAS A 43%

INTEREST IN AMERICAN CENTURY COMPANIES, INC., WHOSE AUM TOTALED $98 BILLION AND $87 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. CUSTODY, BROKERAGE, ADMINISTRATION, AND DEPOSITS WERE

$478 BILLION, UP 135%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, AS WELL AS MARKET APPRECIATION AND NET INFLOWS

ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

AUS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, TOTALED $764 BILLION, UP 19% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR-END. AUM TOTALED $561

BILLION, UP 9%, AND CUSTODY, BROKERAGE, ADMINISTRATION AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WERE $203 BILLION, UP

54%. THE INCREASE IN AUM WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER EQUITY MARKET VALUATIONS IN CLIENT PORTFOLIOS, PARTLY

OFFSET BY INSTITUTIONAL NET OUTFLOWS. CUSTODY, BROKERAGE, ADMINISTRATION AND DEPOSITS GREW BY $70

BILLION, DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF RPS ($41 BILLION), HIGHER EQUITY MARKET VALUATIONS IN CLIENT

PORTFOLIOS AND NET INFLOWS FROM PRIVATE BANK CLIENTS.

THE DIVERSIFICATION OF AUS ACROSS PRODUCT CLASSES, CLIENT SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS HELPED TO

MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF MARKET VOLATILITY ON REVENUE. THE FIRM ALSO HAD A 44% INTEREST IN AMERICAN

CENTURY COMPANIES, INC., WHOSE AUM TOTALED $87 BILLION AND $72 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $61 MILLION, DOWN FROM EARNINGS OF $668 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.8 BILLION, UP 43% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF

NONINTEREST REVENUE IS SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, WHICH TOTALED $1.8 BILLION, UP 73% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF NET GAINS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO OF $1.4 BILLION

IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $27 MILLION IN NET GAINS IN 2003. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE GAINS WERE

LOWER INVESTMENT SECURITIES GAINS IN TREASURY.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS A NEGATIVE $1.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A NEGATIVE $177 MILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE DECLINE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTIONS AND POLICIES ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

MERGER.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.3 BILLION WAS UP $772 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE MERGER. THE

MERGER RESULTED IN HIGHER GROSS COMPENSATION AND NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER ALLOCATION OF THESE EXPENSES TO THE BUSINESSES. INCREMENTAL ALLOCATIONS TO THE

BUSINESSES WERE LOWER THAN THE GROSS EXPENSE INCREASE DUE TO CERTAIN POLICIES ADOPTED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER. THESE POLICIES RETAIN OVERHEAD COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED BY THE

LINES OF BUSINESS IF OPERATED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, AS WELL AS COSTS IN EXCESS OF THE MARKET

PRICE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CORPORATE STAFF AND TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS AREAS.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE AND IBM ANNOUNCED THE FIRMS PLANS TO REINTEGRATE THE

PORTIONS OF ITS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE  INCLUDING DATA CENTERS, HELP DESKS, DISTRIBUTED

COMPUTING, DATA NETWORKS AND VOICE NETWORKS  THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY OUTSOURCED TO IBM. IN JANUARY

2005, APPROXIMATELY 3,100 EMPLOYEES AND 800 CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

FOR 2003, CORPORATE HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF $668 MILLION, COMPARED WITH AN OPERATING LOSS OF $235

MILLION IN 2002, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER GAINS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO AND INCOME TAX

BENEFITS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY EQUITY FUNDS WERE $563 MILLION, $1.3 BILLION AND

$2.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

PRIVATE EQUITYS OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR TOTALED $602 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $290

MILLION IN 2003. THIS IMPROVEMENT REFLECTED A $1.4 BILLION INCREASE IN TOTAL PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS.

IN 2004, MARKETS IMPROVED FOR INVESTMENT SALES, RESULTING IN $1.4 BILLION OF REALIZED GAINS ON

DIRECT INVESTMENTS, COMPARED WITH $535 MILLION IN 2003. NET WRITE-DOWNS ON DIRECT INVESTMENTS WERE

$192 MILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $404 MILLION IN 2003, AS VALUATIONS CONTINUED TO STABILIZE AMID

POSITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $7.5 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $247 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

MERGER. OTHERWISE, THE PORTFOLIO DECLINED AS A RESULT OF SALES OF INVESTMENTS, CONSISTENT WITH

MANAGEMENTS INTENTION TO REDUCE OVER TIME THE CAPITAL COMMITTED TO PRIVATE EQUITY. SALES OF

THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN CARRYING VALUE OF $458 MILLION, TO $641

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO RECOGNIZED NEGATIVE TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $190 MILLION AND OPERATING

LOSSES OF $290 MILLION IN 2003. OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE VALUE THROUGH SALES, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS) OF INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH LIMITED, IMPROVED DURING THE YEAR AS THE

M&A AND IPO MARKETS STARTED TO RECOVER.

PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS TOTALED $27 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $733 MILLION IN 2002.

PRIVATE EQUITY RECOGNIZED GAINS OF $346 MILLION ON DIRECT INVESTMENTS AND LOSSES OF $319 MILLION ON

SALES AND WRITEDOWNS OF PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE FIRMS TOTAL ASSETS WERE $1.2 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $386 BILLION, OR

50%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. MERGER-RELATED GROWTH IN ASSETS WAS

PRIMARILY IN: AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES; INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES RELATED TO BANK

ONES CONDUIT BUSINESS; WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS; AND GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES, WHICH WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING IMPACT OF THE MERGER. NONMERGER-RELATED GROWTH WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IBS INCREASED TRADING ACTIVITY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED, AS WELL AS TRADING ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE FIRMS TOTAL LIABILITIES WERE $1.1 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $327 BILLION,

OR 45%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AGAIN PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. MERGER-RELATED GROWTH IN

LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-BEARING U.S. DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES AND BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

NONMERGER-RELATED GROWTH IN LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN NONINTEREST-BEARING

U.S. DEPOSITS AND THE IBS TRADING ACTIVITY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED.

TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRMS DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING GOVERNMENT

AND CORPORATE DEBT) AND CASH EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR BOTH MARKET-MAKING AND

PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE OVER 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN

CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ACROSS INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS, AS WELL AS

AN INCREASE IN PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY, CREDIT AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES FOR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE DECLINE FROM 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FIRMS ELECTION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2004, TO REPORT THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NET OF CASH RECEIVED AND PAID, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

AND NOTE 3 ON PAGES 5769 AND 9091, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

AFS SECURITIES INCLUDE FIXED INCOME (E.G., U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS

WELL AS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE DEBT) AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM USES AFS

SECURITIES PRIMARILY TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK. THE AFS PORTFOLIO GREW BY $34.3 BILLION FROM THE

2003 YEAR-END PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE WERE NET SALES IN THE

TREASURY PORTFOLIO SINCE THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE MERGER, BOTH HERITAGE

FIRMS REDUCED THE LEVEL OF THEIR AFS SECURITIES TO REPOSITION THE COMBINED FIRM. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO NOTE 9 ON PAGES 98100 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS

LOANS, NET OF ALLOWANCE, WERE $394.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN INCREASE OF 88% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS GROWTH IN BOTH THE

RFS AND CS LOAN PORTFOLIOS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER WHOLESALE LOANS IN THE IB. FOR A MORE

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 5769 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE $42.9 BILLION INCREASE IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE MERGER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE

FIRMS OTHER ACQUISITIONS SUCH AS EFS AND

THE MAJORITY STAKE IN HIGHBRIDGE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 109111 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

DEPOSITS

DEPOSITS ARE A KEY SOURCE OF FUNDING. THE STABILITY OF THIS FUNDING SOURCE IS AFFECTED BY SUCH

FACTORS AS RETURNS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS ON ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS, THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER

SERVICE LEVELS AND COMPETITIVE FORCES. DEPOSITS INCREASED BY 60% FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003, PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF THE MERGER AND GROWTH IN DEPOSITS IN TSS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TSS

SEGMENT DISCUSSION AND THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4344 AND 5556,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

LONG-TERM DEBT INCREASED BY 99% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND NET NEW DEBT

ISSUANCES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITY, SEE THE LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 5556 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY 129% TO $105.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 5052 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CAPITAL SUFFICIENT

TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, MEASURED BY ECONOMIC RISK

CAPITAL, AND TO MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL

ABOVE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN AMOUNTS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE MANAGEMENTS DEBT RATING

OBJECTIVES. THE FIRMS CAPITAL FRAMEWORK IS INTEGRATED

INTO THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM MAY REFINE ITS METHODOLOGY

FOR ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AS THE

MERGER INTEGRATION PROCESS CONTINUES.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN EACH

OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.



MEASURE PERFORMANCE IN EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF

IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK

MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. RETURN ON

EQUITY IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS A PRIMARY MEASURE

OF A BUSINESS SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE.

FOR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, THE FIRM DOES NOT ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS

BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT THE ACCOUNTING-DRIVEN ALLOCATION

OF GOODWILL COULD DISTORT ASSESSMENT OF RELATIVE RETURNS. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THIS APPROACH

FOSTERS BETTER COMPARISON OF LINE OF BUSINESS RETURNS WITH OTHER

INTERNAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS WITH PEERS. THE FIRM ASSIGNS AN AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL

EQUAL TO THE THEN CURRENT BOOK VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL TO THE

CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL RELATED TO THE FIRMS GOODWILL ASSETS IS MANAGED

WITHIN THIS SEGMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142, THE FIRM

ALLOCATES GOODWILL TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES

AND THEN PERFORMS THE REQUIRED IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT TESTING, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND NOTE 15 ON

PAGES 7779 AND 109111 RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IS A NEW METHODOLOGY

RESULTING FROM THE MERGER. THEREFORE, CURRENT YEAR LINE OF

BUSINESS EQUITY IS NOT COMPARABLE TO EQUITY ASSIGNED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IN PRIOR YEARS. THE

INCREASE IN AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR

2004 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER.

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM ASSIGNS ECONOMIC

CAPITAL BASED PRIMARILY ON FIVE RISK FACTORS: CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND

BUSINESS RISK FOR EACH BUSINESS; AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (INVESTMENT BANK,

COMMERCIAL BANKING, ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES) AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES (RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD

SERVICES).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, FROM BOTH DEFAULTS AND DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE

DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION, MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH

THE LEVEL OF CAPITALIZATION NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A TARGETED AA SOLVENCY STANDARD. UNEXPECTED

LOSSES ARE IN EXCESS OF THOSE FOR WHICH PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE MAINTAINED. IN ADDITION TO

MATURITY AND CORRELATIONS, CAPITAL ALLOCATION IS DIFFERENTIATED BY SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF

CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT, LOSS SEVERITY,

AND MARKET CREDIT SPREAD.



LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES IN AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION

IS REPRESENTED BY THE EXPECTED POSITIVE EXPOSURE BASED ON POTENTIAL MOVEMENTS OF UNDERLYING

MARKET RATES. LOAN EQUIVALENTS FOR UNUSED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT LIKELY, BASED ON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS.



DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS FOR ALL PUBLICLY TRADED

NAMES OR INVESTMENT BANKING CLIENTS, YIELDING A FORWARD-LOOKING MEASURE OF CREDIT RISK. THIS

FACILITATES MORE ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT BY UTILIZING THE GROWING MARKET IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND

SECONDARY MARKET LOAN SALES. FOR PRIVATELY-HELD FIRMS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKING PORTFOLIO, DEFAULT

LIKELIHOOD IS BASED ON LONGER TERM AVERAGES OVER AN ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE.



LOSS SEVERITY OF EXPOSURE IS BASED ON THE FIRMS AVERAGE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE DURING WORKOUTS,

WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR COLLATERAL OR SUBORDINATION.



MARKET CREDIT SPREADS ARE USED IN THE EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN EXPOSURE VALUE DUE TO CREDIT

DETERIORATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A CAPITAL LEVEL

SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT AN AA RATING, AND ITS ALLOCATION IS BASED ON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT

RISK SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE

UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO THE AA SOLVENCY

STANDARD. STATISTICAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OR PORTFOLIOS ARE ADJUSTED UPWARD TO ENSURE THAT

CAPITAL IS CONSISTENT WITH EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS, INCLUDING SUBORDINATION LEVELS ON MARKET

TRANSACTIONS AND CAPITAL HELD AT REPRESENTATIVE MONOLINE COMPETITORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE

EXTENT TO WHICH RISKS ARE PRESENT IN BUSINESSES. DAILY VAR, MONTHLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER

FACTORS DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CHARGES FOR MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. SEE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7074 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK

MEASURES. THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT ACCORDING TO A FORMULA

THAT WEIGHTS THAT SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS TEST EXPOSURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL RISK ON A BOTTOMS-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED ON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

AND WITH A POTENTIAL OFFSET FOR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE MODEL IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT EVENTUALLY FOR QUALIFICATION

UNDER THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL

BUSINESS RISK IS DEFINED AS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH VOLATILITY IN THE FIRMS EARNINGS DUE TO

FACTORS NOT CAPTURED BY OTHER PARTS OF ITS ECONOMIC-CAPITAL FRAMEWORK. SUCH VOLATILITY CAN ARISE

FROM INEFFECTIVE DESIGN OR EXECUTION OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES, VOLATILE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITY, CHANGING CLIENT EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS, AND RESTRUCTURING TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. FOR BUSINESS RISK, CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS BASED ON

HISTORICAL REVENUE VOLATILITY AND MEASURES OF FIXED AND VARIABLE EXPENSES. EARNINGS VOLATILITY

ARISING FROM OTHER RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS CREDIT, MARKET, OR OPERATIONAL RISK, IS EXCLUDED FROM THE

MEASUREMENT OF BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL, AS THOSE FACTORS ARE CAPTURED UNDER THEIR RESPECTIVE RISK

CAPITAL MODELS.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PUBLICLY- AND PRIVATELY-HELD SECURITIES AND THIRD PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS

AND COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A

DECLINE IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS, POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY

LIQUIDITY RISK. THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS BASED UPON MEASUREMENT

OF THE LOSS EXPERIENCE SUFFERED BY THE FIRM AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD

OF ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FIRMS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, THE FRB, ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING

WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE

FIRMS NATIONAL

BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK)

AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION.

ON MARCH 1, 2005, THE

FRB ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT CONTINUES THE INCLUSION OF TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO STRICTER

QUANTITATIVE LIMITS. THE RULE PROVIDES FOR A FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION

PERIOD. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE FINAL RULE.

THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE IS DEPENDENT ON THE DATE OF

PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.

ON JULY 20, 2004, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT EXCLUDES ASSETS

OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF FIN 46R FROM

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS FOR PURPOSES OF COMPUTING TIER 1 AND TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS. THE

FINAL RULE ALSO REQUIRES THAT CAPITAL BE HELD AGAINST SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY FACILITIES SUPPORTING

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. THE FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2004.

ADOPTION OF THE RULE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL RATIOS OF THE FIRM. IN ADDITION,

UNDER THE FINAL RULE, BOTH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY FACILITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

ASSET QUALITY TESTS EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2005.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SHOW THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED A WELL-CAPITALIZED POSITION BASED ON TIER

EQUITY OF $60.2 BILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STOCK ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF $57.3

BILLION AND NET INCOME OF $4.5 BILLION; THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS PAID OF $3.9

BILLION AND COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES OF $738 MILLION. THE MERGER ADDED TIER 1 COMPONENTS SUCH AS

$3.0 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL QUALIFYING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND $493 MILLION OF MINORITY

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES; TIER 1 DEDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE MERGER INCLUDED $34.1

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BASEL II

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION PUBLISHED THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IN 2004 IN AN

EFFORT TO UPDATE THE ORIGINAL INTERNATIONAL BANK CAPITAL ACCORD (BASEL I), IN EFFECT SINCE 1988.

THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY OF CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

INTERNATIONALLY, MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL MORE RISK SENSITIVE, AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT

PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE SUPPORTS THE

OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK.

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE

EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED

MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES EMPLOYING ITS INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO DERIVE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE FRB THAT ITS INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY

STANDARDS. THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK WILL BE FULLY EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2008. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS

TO IMPLEMENT THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK WITHIN THIS TIMEFRAME.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY ANALYZING LOCAL BASEL II REQUIREMENTS IN MAJOR JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE

THE U.S. WHERE IT OPERATES. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS, DIFFERENT APPROACHES MAY BE

IMPLEMENTED IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS.

DIVIDENDS

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND POLICY REFLECTS ITS EARNINGS OUTLOOK, DESIRED PAYOUT RATIOS,

THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVEL AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IN 2004,

JPMORGAN CHASE DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON ITS COMMON STOCK OF $0.34 PER SHARE. THE FIRM

ANTICIPATES A DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO IN 2005 OF 30-40% OF OPERATING EARNINGS.

STOCK REPURCHASES

ON JULY 20, 2004, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INITIAL STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $6.0 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO OFFSET ISSUANCES

UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF SHARES REPURCHASED WILL BE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. DURING 2004, UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 19.3 MILLION

SHARES FOR $738 MILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $38.27. THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY

SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING 2003.

OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), LINES OF CREDIT AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. THE PRINCIPAL USES OF SPES

ARE TO OBTAIN SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING THEIR

FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND TO CREATE OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN

IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS

ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, SPES ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MARKETS

FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF

THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CREDITORS OF OTHER

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER OF ASSETS, SPES ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SPES IN THREE BROAD CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS: LOAN

SECURITIZATIONS, MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION. CAPITAL IS HELD, AS APPROPRIATE,

AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM,

SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGE 88, NOTE 13 ON PAGES 103106 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 106109 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS WORLDWIDE RULES

OF CONDUCT.

THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM ACTING ON BEHALF OF

THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND

F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF THESE LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS WAS $79.4 BILLION AND $34.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF FUNDING UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT, OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

OF ITS $79.4 BILLION IN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $47.7 BILLION IS

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS TOTAL OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, INCLUDED IN THE TABLE

BELOW (COMPARED WITH $27.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003). AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION

OF MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46R, $31.7 BILLION OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE

EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE (COMPARED WITH $6.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003), AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS

OF THE SPES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE REVENUE REPORTED IN THE TABLE BELOW PRIMARILY REPRESENTS SERVICING AND CUSTODIAL FEE INCOME.

THE FIRM ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN SPES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS; THESE TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

(I.E., MTM GAINS AND LOSSES) RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE. SUCH MTM GAINS AND LOSSES ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE REVENUE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND

ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF ITS MAJOR RISKS. IN ADDITION, THIS FRAMEWORK RECOGNIZES THE DIVERSITY AMONG

THE FIRMS CORE BUSINESSES, WHICH HELPS REDUCE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA ON

ITS OPERATING RESULTS AS A WHOLE.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS CRITICAL TO ITS

SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION.

THE FIRM IDENTIFIES RISK BY DYNAMICALLY ASSESSING

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS ON TRANSACTIONS AND

POSITIONS. BUSINESS AND RISK PROFESSIONALS DEVELOP APPROPRIATE MITIGATION

STRATEGIES FOR THE IDENTIFIED RISKS.



RISK MEASUREMENT.

THE

FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES,

INCLUDING CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND

VALUE-AT-RISK,

AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS TESTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL

BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUTINELY

REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRMS RISK ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECTIVE OF UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL.

THE FIRM ESTABLISHES RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES. THESE POLICIES CONTAIN APPROVED LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND BUSINESS THAT ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS

AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING.

RISK REPORTING COVERS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND IS PROVIDED TO MANAGEMENT ON A

DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS AS APPROPRIATE.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS BUILT UPON THE PREMISE THAT EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THERE ARE SEVEN MAJOR RISK

TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK,

OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND REPUTATION RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK AND PRINCIPAL RISK. AS

PART OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, EACH LINE OF BUSINESS HAS A RISK COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR

DECISIONS RELATING TO RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND CONTROL. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE RISK COMMITTEES

ESCALATE RISK ISSUES TO THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE, COMPRISED OF SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE FIRM,

OR TO THE RISK WORKING GROUP, A SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK

COMMITTEES, THERE IS AN ASSET & LIABILITY COMMITTEE

(ALCO), WHICH OVERSEES

STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK AS WELL AS THE FIRMS FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

POLICY, THROUGH WHICH LINES OF BUSINESS TRANSFER MARKET-HEDGABLE INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY.

TREASURY ALSO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO ITS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND

CONTROL. THERE IS ALSO AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, WHICH REVIEWS KEY ASPECTS OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL M&A

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF

ESTABLISHED PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

OVERLAYING RISK MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS IS THE CORPORATE FUNCTION OF RISK

MANAGEMENT WHICH, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER REPORTING TO THE PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, PROVIDES AN INDEPENDENT FIRMWIDE FUNCTION FOR CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF

RISK. WITHIN

RISK MANAGEMENT ARE THOSE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK,

FIDUCIARY RISK, PRINCIPAL RISK, AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS RISK

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK POLICY AND METHODOLOGY, RISK REPORTING

AND RISK EDUCATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AS A WHOLE AND THROUGH THE BOARDS

AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF

GUIDELINES AND POLICIES TO GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS

UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENTS

RESPONSIBILITIES TO ASSESS AND MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK,

INVESTMENT RISK AND LIQUIDITY RISK, AND IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEW OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY AND

ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. BOTH COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF REPUTATIONAL RISK.

THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND OTHER MANAGEMENT REPORT ON THE RISKS OF THE FIRM TO THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE BOARDS AUDIT COMMITTEE AND RISK POLICY COMMITTEE.

THE MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK ARISES FROM THE GENERAL FUNDING NEEDS OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE

MANAGEMENT OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. JPMORGAN CHASES LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS

INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS AND MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS. THROUGH ACTIVE LIQUIDITY

MANAGEMENT, THE FIRM SEEKS TO PRESERVE STABLE, RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. THIS

ENABLES THE FIRM TO REPLACE MATURING OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND FUND ASSETS AT APPROPRIATE MATURITIES

AND RATES IN ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENTS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, MANAGEMENT USES A VARIETY OF LIQUIDITY

RISK MEASURES THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MARKET CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, LIQUIDITY

NEEDS AND THE DESIRED MATURITY PROFILE OF LIABILITIES.

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY STRATEGY AND TARGETS, UNDERSTANDING

THE FIRMS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS, PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE, OVERSEEING

POLICY ADHERENCE, AND MAINTAINING CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING. IN ADDITION, IT

IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY WARNING SIGNALS, SUCH AS THE UNUSUAL

WIDENING OF SPREADS, TO PERMIT EARLY DETECTION OF LIQUIDITY ISSUES.

THE FIRMS THREE PRIMARY MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE.



HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM POSITION: MEASURES THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANYS ABILITY TO REPAY ALL OBLIGATIONS WITH A MATURITY LESS THAN ONE

YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BANKS TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IS CONSTRAINED.



CASH CAPITAL SURPLUS: MEASURES THE FIRMS ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A

FULLY COLLATERALIZED BASIS, ASSUMING ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS LOST.



BASIC SURPLUS: MEASURES JPMORGAN CHASE BANKS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN A

90-DAY STRESS EVENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRM WHERE NO NEW FUNDING

CAN BE RAISED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE.

ALL THREE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY MEASURES ARE MANAGED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SURPLUS IN THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING

TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF

THE FIRM THROUGH BOTH NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. TREASURY ANALYZES REPORTS TO MONITOR THE DIVERSITY

AND MATURITY STRUCTURE OF THE FIRMS SOURCES OF FUNDING, AND TO ASSESS DOWNGRADE IMPACT SCENARIOS,

CONTINGENT FUNDING NEEDS, AND OVERALL COLLATERAL AVAILABILITY AND PLEDGING STATUS. A CONTINGENCY

FUNDING PLAN IS IN PLACE, INTENDED TO HELP THE FIRM MANAGE THROUGH PERIODS WHEN ACCESS TO FUNDING

IS TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. A DOWNGRADE ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A ONE- AND

TWO-NOTCH

DOWNGRADE AT BOTH THE PARENT AND BANK LEVEL, AND CALCULATES THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF FUNDING AS WELL

AS THE INCREASE IN ANNUAL FUNDING COSTS IN BOTH SCENARIOS. A TRIGGER-RISK FUNDING ANALYSIS

CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF A BANK DOWNGRADE BELOW A-1/P-1, INCLUDING THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THAT

WOULD BE REQUIRED IF SUCH AN EVENT WERE TO OCCUR. THESE LIQUIDITY ANALYTICS RELY ON MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT ABOUT JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR USE THEM AS COLLATERAL FOR

BORROWINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTS HISTORICAL DATA ON THE FUNDING OF LOAN

COMMITMENTS (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER BACK-UP FACILITIES), LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, COMMITMENTS

WITH RATING TRIGGERS AND COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES AND

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH

OBLIGATIONS ON PAGES 52-53, AS WELL AS NOTE 1, NOTE 13, NOTE 14 AND NOTE 27 ON PAGES 88,

103-106, 106-109, AND 119-120, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

THE DIVERSITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING SOURCES ENHANCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS

DEPENDENCE ON ANY ONE SOURCE, THEREBY MINIMIZING THE COST OF FUNDS. A MAJOR SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS PROVIDED BY ITS LARGE CORE DEPOSIT BASE. CORE DEPOSITS INCLUDE ALL U.S.

DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FDIC, UP TO THE LEGAL LIMIT OF $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR. IN 2004, CORE BANK

DEPOSITS GREW APPROXIMATELY 116% FROM 2003 YEAR-END LEVELS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE MERGER, AS

WELL AS GROWTH WITHIN RFS AND TSS. IN ADDITION TO CORE DEPOSITS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM

SUBSTANTIAL, STABLE DEPOSIT BALANCES ORIGINATED BY TSS, COMMERCIAL BANKING AND THE IB THROUGH THE

NORMAL COURSE OF THEIR BUSINESSES.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE REPURCHASE AND ASSET

SECURITIZATION MARKETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $72 BILLION OF SECURITIES WERE AVAILABLE FOR

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND $36 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND MORTGAGE LOANS WERE AVAILABLE

FOR SECURITIZATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE

BALANCE OF SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING. THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED GAINS

ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND YIELDS OF THE ASSETS

SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY NOT DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE ISSUING ENTITY.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THESE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION

TRUSTS, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTES 13 AND 14

ON PAGES 103-106 AND 106-109, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE MARKETS SERVE AS A

COST-EFFECTIVE SOURCE OF FUNDS AND ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT.

DECISIONS CONCERNING THE TIMING AND TENOR OF ACCESSING THESE MARKETS ARE BASED ON RELATIVE COSTS,

GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PROSPECTIVE VIEWS OF BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND A TARGETED LIQUIDITY

PROFILE.

ISSUANCE

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED IN 2004 ACROSS MOST INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS, REFLECTING THE MARKET

PERCEPTION THAT CREDIT RISKS WERE IMPROVING, AS THE NUMBER OF DOWNGRADES DECLINED, CORPORATE

BALANCE SHEET CASH POSITIONS INCREASED, AND CORPORATE PROFITS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. JPMORGAN

CHASES CREDIT SPREADS PERFORMED IN LINE WITH PEER SPREADS IN 2004. THE FIRM TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

NARROWING CREDIT SPREADS GLOBALLY BY OPPORTUNISTICALLY ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL

SECURITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CONSISTENT WITH ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICY, THE FIRM HAS

RAISED FUNDS AT THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANY SUFFICIENT TO COVER MATURING OBLIGATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND TO SUPPORT THE LESS

LIQUID ASSETS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET. HIGH INVESTOR CASH POSITIONS AND INCREASED FOREIGN INVESTOR

PARTICIPATION IN THE CORPORATE MARKETS ALLOWED JPMORGAN CHASE TO DIVERSIFY FURTHER ITS FUNDING

ACROSS THE GLOBAL MARKETS WHILE DECREASING FUNDING COSTS AND LENGTHENING MATURITIES.

DURING 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $25.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL

SECURITIES. THESE ISSUANCES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $ 16.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL

SECURITIES THAT MATURED OR WERE REDEEMED, AND THE FIRMS REDEMPTION OF $670 MILLION OF

PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, IN 2004 THE FIRM SECURITIZED APPROXIMATELY $6.5 BILLION OF

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $8.9 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS AND $1.6 BILLION OF AUTOMOBILE LOANS,

RESULTING IN PRE-TAX GAINS (LOSSES) ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $47 MILLION, $52 MILLION AND $(3)

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES

103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, MOODYS UPGRADED THE RATINGS OF THE FIRM BY ONE NOTCH, MOVING THE

PARENT HOLDING COMPANYS SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING TO AA3 AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANKS SENIOR

LONG-TERM DEBT RATING TO AA2; AND CHANGED ITS OUTLOOK TO STABLE. ALSO AT THAT TIME, FITCH AFFIRMED

ITS RATINGS AND CHANGED ITS OUTLOOK TO POSITIVE, WHILE S&P AFFIRMED ALL ITS RATINGS AND KEPT ITS

OUTLOOK STABLE.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION IN

THESE RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ACCESS TO

LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND

DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND. CRITICAL FACTORS IN

MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM; STRONG CAPITAL

RATIOS; STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS; DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES; AND STRONG

LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

IF THE FIRMS RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF

FUNDS AND THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF FUNDING TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE

MATERIAL. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM BELIEVES A DOWNGRADE IS UNLIKELY. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR

VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ON PAGES

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES

CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES, FROM LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS TO LOANS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

CONSUMER. MANAGEMENT MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP OF EACH PORTFOLIO, DISCOURAGING THE

RETENTION OF LOAN ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED

CAPITAL. THE FIRMS BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR ITS LARGE CORPORATE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO REMAINS

PRIMARILY ONE OF ORIGINATION FOR DISTRIBUTION; THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

LOAN ORIGINATIONS (PRIMARILY TO IB CLIENTS) CONTINUE TO BE DISTRIBUTED INTO THE MARKETPLACE, WITH

RESIDUAL HOLDS BY THE FIRM AVERAGING LESS THAN 10%. WITH REGARD TO THE PRIME CONSUMER CREDIT

MARKET, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A

GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE.

THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AS

DESCRIBED IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART BELOW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

IN 2004, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINE, MANAGING WHOLESALE

SINGLE-NAME AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION THROUGH ITS THRESHOLD AND LIMIT STRUCTURE AND USING CREDIT

DERIVATIVES AND LOAN SALES IN ITS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY. THE FIRM MANAGES WHOLESALE

EXPOSURE CONCENTRATIONS BY OBLIGOR, RISK RATING, INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

CONTINUED TO MAKE PROGRESS UNDER ITS MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REENGINEER SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE

CREDIT RISK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE GOAL IS TO ENHANCE THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AND

ACCURATE RISK AND EXPOSURE INFORMATION; ACTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK IN THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO;

SUPPORT CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; MORE QUICKLY MANAGE THE ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL; AND COMPLY

WITH BASEL II INITIATIVES.

IN 2004, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO GROW ITS CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO, FOCUSING ON BUSINESSES PROVIDING

THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP WHILE KEEPING WITHIN THE FIRMS DESIRED RISK

TOLERANCE. DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE FIRM ALSO COMPLETED A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF ALL CONSUMER LENDING

PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS. THIS ACTION RESULTED IN THE SALE OF THE $4 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN

PORTFOLIO, DE-EMPHASIZING VEHICLE LEASING AND, SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END 2004, THE SALE OF A $2

BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PORTFOLIO. CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE CORE CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCT SET

(RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, AUTO AND EDUCATION FINANCE, CREDIT CARDS AND SMALL BUSINESS) REFLECTED A

FOCUS ON THE PRIME CREDIT QUALITY SEGMENT OF THE MARKET.

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS LENDING (E.G., LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS), DERIVATIVES TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK ALSO ARISES DUE TO

COUNTRY OR SOVEREIGN EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF GUARANTEES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. LOSSES GENERATED BY CONSUMER LOANS ARE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN

WHOLESALE LOSSES BUT ARE SUBJECT TO CYCLICAL AND SEASONAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF LOSS

IS HIGHER ON CONSUMER LOANS THAN ON WHOLESALE LOANS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND

MORE MANAGEABLE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, METHODOLOGIES VARY DEPENDING ON CERTAIN FACTORS,

INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK MEASUREMENT

PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND CREDIT BUREAU SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK RATING) AND RISK

MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED

WORKOUT GROUPS).

CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE COUNTERPARTY

DEFAULT, AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED

MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ARE

STATISTICALLY-BASED ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER TIME, ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE

ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD BE FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL

AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF

LOSSES (REFER TO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 50-51 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF THE CREDIT RISK CAPITAL METHODOLOGY). RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY

BASED ON RISK-RATED EXPOSURE; AND FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IT IS BASED ON CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED, PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON

ESTIMATES OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS EXPECTED

DEFAULT CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE BASED

ON COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

BASED ON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW. RISK RATINGS ARE

ASSIGNED AND REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO

REFLECT THE BORROWERS CURRENT RISK PROFILE AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL POSITION.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES), PROBABLE LOSS

IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. PROBABLE

LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT

TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, COMMON MEASURES OF

CREDIT QUALITY DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO PREDICT CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER

RISK CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN

ORIGINATION SOURCES, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING

CHARGE-OFF POLICIES. THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT PORTFOLIOS IN

ORDER TO FORECAST DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE

LOSSES. THESE FACTORS AND ANALYSES ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF DECISION-MAKING AND ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ACCURATELY ASSESSED, PROPERLY APPROVED,

CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND ACTIVELY MANAGED AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY

FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CREDIT LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES,

PORTFOLIO-REVIEW PARAMETERS AND PROBLEM-LOAN MANAGEMENT. WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS CONTINUALLY

MONITORED ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. FOR CONSUMER

CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS ITEMS ARE TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO

GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND

INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS.

IN ORDER TO MEET ITS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A RISK PROFILE

THAT IS DIVERSE IN TERMS OF BORROWER, PRODUCT TYPE, INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION.

ADDITIONAL DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH SYNDICATION OF CREDITS,

PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION

TECHNIQUES.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT METRIC

FORECASTS, HOLD-LIMIT EXCEPTIONS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

REGULARLY. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS

OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY

SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS

AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE REGULARLY PROVIDED TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, THE OPERATING COMMITTEE.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE INCREASE IN TOTAL WHOLESALE EXPOSURE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DUE TO THE MERGER.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DECLINED BY $18 BILLION, PRIMARILY BECAUSE, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2004, THE

FIRM ELECTED TO REPORT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NET OF CASH RECEIVED AND

PAID, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS. LOANS, LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS

AND INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES INCREASED BY $60 BILLION, $98 BILLION AND $27 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE  SELECTED INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION

THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES THE SIZE AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, WITH

PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. FOLLOWING THE

MERGER, THE FIRM COMMENCED A THOROUGH REVIEW OF INDUSTRY DEFINITIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS IN EACH OF THE

HERITAGE FIRMS PORTFOLIOS. AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW, THE FIRMS INDUSTRY STRUCTURE WAS MODIFIED,

RESULTING IN TWO NEW INDUSTRY GROUPS WITHIN THE TOP-10 INDUSTRY CONCEN-

TRATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004: BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES (CONSISTS OF THE INDUSTRIES TERMED

COMMERCIAL BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES AND LESSORS AT YEAR-END 2003) AND RETAIL AND CONSUMER

SERVICES (PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE INDUSTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003). THE MERGER RESULTED IN INCREASES IN

NEARLY EVERY TOP 10 INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION. EXPOSURES TO BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES AND ASSET

MANAGERS DECLINED, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS ELECTION TO REPORT FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NET OF CASH RECEIVED AND PAID, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, WHICH AFFECTED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO IS TRANSACTED WITH CUSTOMERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES.

SELECTED INDUSTRY DISCUSSION

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE

AND WHICH IT CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES.

THIS INDUSTRY GROUP, PRIMARILY CONSISTING

OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL BANKS, IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. CREDIT QUALITY IS HIGH, AS 90% OF THE EXPOSURE

IN THIS CATEGORY IS RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE.



REAL ESTATE.

WHOLESALE REAL ESTATE GREW CONSIDERABLY AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER. THE RESULTING EXPOSURE IS DIVERSIFIED BY TRANSACTION TYPE, BORROWER

BASE, GEOGRAPHY AND PROPERTY TYPE. IN 2004, THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO

BENEFIT FROM DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING, LOW INTEREST RATES, HIGH LIQUIDITY

AND INCREASED CAPITAL DEMAND.



ALL OTHER.

ALL OTHER AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, INCLUDED $298 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO 21

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED TO SPES AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS TOTALED 45% OF THIS

CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING (GENERALLY BACKED BY RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR BONDS ON A

BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE, NON-RECOURSE OR LIMITED-RECOURSE BASIS) ORIGINATED BY COMPANIES IN A DIVERSE

GROUP OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT HIGHLY CORRELATED. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS OTHER INDUSTRIES, NONE OF WHICH COMPRISES MORE THAN 3% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE

EXPOSURES DEEMED CRITICIZED GENERALLY REPRESENT A RATINGS PROFILE SIMILAR TO A RATING OF CCC+/CAA1

AND LOWER, AS DEFINED BY STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS. DESPITE THE MERGER, THE CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF

THE PORTFOLIO DECREASED TO $8.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, FROM $8.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2003.

THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT DUE TO DEBT REPAYMENTS AND

WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING ASSETS (EXCLUDING PURCHASED HELD-FOR-SALE WHOLESALE LOANS) DECREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2003, AS A RESULT OF GROSS CHARGE-OFFS OF $543 MILLION TAKEN DURING 2004. WHOLESALE

NET CHARGE-OFFS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED WITH 2003, AS A RESULT OF LOWER GROSS CHARGE-OFFS

AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER RECOVERIES. THE 2004 WHOLESALE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 0.19%, COMPARED

WITH 0.97% IN 2003.

ALTHOUGH FUTURE CHARGE-OFFS IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO AND OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES, WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM HISTORIC

PERFORMANCE, THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WILL BE HIGHER IN

2005 THAN IT WAS IN 2004, AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES MOVES TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS OVER

TIME.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS, TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH TRADING ACTIVITIES, TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS AND TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT RISK. THE FIRM USES THE

SAME CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AS THOSE USED FOR TRADITIONAL LENDING TO ASSESS AND APPROVE

POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURES WHEN ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND THE REPORTED DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES (I.E., THE MTM OR FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

EFFECTS OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS) AT EACH OF THE DATES INDICATED.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE $41 TRILLION OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SUCH

TRANSACTIONS. FOR MOST DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE

HANDS; IT IS SIMPLY USED AS A REFERENCE TO CALCULATE PAYMENTS. THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT

CREDIT RISK IS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE MTM VALUE OF THE CONTRACT, WHICH REPRESENTS THE COST TO

REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS MORE THAN ONE TRANSACTION OUTSTANDING WITH A COUNTERPARTY, AND A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER

NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NETTED MTM EXPOSURE, LESS COLLATERAL HELD,

REPRESENTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE MTM VALUE OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES (AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF NET CASH RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT

ANNEXES TO SUCH LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS) WAS $66 BILLION. FURTHER, AFTER

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT $9 BILLION OF OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM, THE NET CURRENT

MTM CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS $57 BILLION.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE) AND

AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE

APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT RISK EMBEDDED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO

IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL PEAK CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE, AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL,

CREDIT RISK IS REDUCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH SEPARATE

COUNTERPARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO TRADES CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS, EVEN IF BOTH COUNTERPARTIES

WERE TO DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIRM REFERS TO THIS EFFECT AS MARKET DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE

MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK (MDP) MEASURE IS A PORTFOLIO AGGREGATION OF COUNTERPARTY PEAK MEASURES,

REPRESENTING THE MAXIMUM LOSSES AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT WOULD OCCUR IF ALL

COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULTED UNDER ANY ONE GIVEN MARKET SCENARIO AND TIMEFRAME.

DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISKINESS OF DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISKINESS OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THIS IS DONE BY

EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A

LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A

LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM

FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVERAGE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE

TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS

USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), AS DESCRIBED FURTHER

BELOW.

THE CHART BELOW SHOWS THE EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY

THE MDP, DRE AND AVG METRICS. ALL THREE MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST

YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

(A)

EXCLUDES $5 BILLION FROM THE $57 BILLION OF REPORTED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM NET OF

CALLS.

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY,

AND ON THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF

CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING

MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE

DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS. THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DOES

NOT INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS INCREASED SLIGHTLY, TO 79% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, FROM 78% AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE

FIRM HELD $41 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 (INCLUDING $32 BILLION OF NET CASH

RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEXES TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS), COMPARED

WITH $36 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE FIRM POSTED $31 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004, COMPARED WITH $27 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY

AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST COLLATERAL

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS

DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, FROM ITS CURRENT RATING OF AA- TO A+, WOULD HAVE BEEN AN

ADDITIONAL $1.5 BILLION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THE FIRM; THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS

DOWNGRADE (FROM AA- TO BBB-) WOULD HAVE BEEN $3.9 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF

EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

IN MANAGING ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM PURCHASES SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT

DERIVATIVES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE NOTIONAL OUTSTANDING AMOUNT OF PROTECTION BOUGHT VIA

SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT DERIVATIVES WAS $35 BILLION AND $2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM

ALSO DIVERSIFIES ITS EXPOSURES BY PROVIDING (I.E., SELLING) CREDIT PROTECTION, WHICH INCREASES

FOR MANAGING CREDIT EXPOSURE (SHORT CREDIT POSITIONS) AND THE CVA, WHICH REFLECTS THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (LONG CREDIT POSITIONS), PROVIDES SOME NATURAL

OFFSET.

IN 2004, THERE WERE $44 MILLION OF LOSSES IN TRADING REVENUE FROM CREDIT PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE LOSSES CONSISTED OF $297 MILLION RELATED TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO

MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE; OF THIS AMOUNT, $234 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT

DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE ACCRUAL LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND $63 MILLION WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED

TO MANAGE THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. THE LOSSES WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE ONGOING COST OF BUYING

CREDIT PROTECTION AND SOME ADDITIONAL IMPACT DUE TO THE GLOBAL TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS. THESE

LOSSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $253 MILLION OF GAINS FROM A DECREASE IN THE MTM VALUE OF

THE CVA, A RESULT OF THE SAME FACTORS.

THE 2003 CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY RESULTED IN $191 MILLION OF LOSSES INCLUDED

IN TRADING REVENUE. THESE LOSSES INCLUDED $746 MILLION RELATED TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES THAT WERE USED

TO RISK MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE; APPROXIMATELY $504 MILLION OF THIS

AMOUNT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE ACCRUAL LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND

THE REMAINDER WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF MTM

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES. THE LOSSES WERE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY AN OVERALL GLOBAL TIGHTENING OF CREDIT

SPREADS. THE $746 MILLION LOSS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $555 MILLION OF TRADING REVENUE GAINS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECREASE IN THE MTM VALUE OF THE CVA DUE TO CREDIT SPREAD TIGHTENING.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE THROUGH LOAN AND COMMITMENT SALES.

DURING 2004 AND 2003, THE FIRM SOLD $5.9 BILLION AND $5.2 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS,

RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN LOSSES OF $8 MILLION AND $54 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FIRMS

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR LIQUIDITY AND

BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DEALER/CLIENT ACTIVITY

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD BY THE DEALER

BUSINESS WERE $501 BILLION AND $532 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THESE NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRM SELLING PROTECTION ON LARGE, DIVERSIFIED, PREDOMINANTLY

INVESTMENT-GRADE PORTFOLIOS (INCLUDING THE MOST SENIOR TRANCHES) AND THEN RISK MANAGING THESE

POSITIONS BY BUYING PROTECTION ON THE MORE SUBORDINATED TRANCHES OF THE SAME PORTFOLIOS. IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY USE SECURITIES TO RISK MANAGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE THERE IS A MISMATCH IN NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, IN THE FIRMS

VIEW, THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $309 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, COMPARED WITH $211 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF

CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE

BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A

LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT

OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED ON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO

BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN

EQUIVALENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, WAS $162 BILLION AND $104 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A

COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING ITS EXPOSURES AND

RISK IN EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES  DEFINED AS THOSE COUNTRIES

POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO SOVEREIGN EVENTS. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY

INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING, AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS

ARE ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G. GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF

CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES LOCATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, IF THE

ENHANCEMENTS FULLY COVER THE COUNTRY RISK, AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS

RISK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ANY

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY WAS NOT MATERIAL. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING

COUNTRY EXPOSURES, THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE AND MANAGE

THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SOVEREIGN CRISES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TOTAL MANAGED CONSUMER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WERE $338 BILLION, UP FROM $174 BILLION

AT YEAR-END 2003, REFLECTING THE ADDITION OF THE BANK ONE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIOS. CONSUMER

LENDINGRELATED COMMITMENTS INCREASED BY 232% TO $601 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECTING THE

IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED

CATEGORIES WITHIN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

AVERAGE RFS LOAN BALANCES FOR 2004 WERE $163 BILLION. NEW LOANS ORIGINATED IN 2004 REFLECT HIGHER

CREDIT QUALITY, CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS FOCUS ON THE PRIME CREDIT MARKET SEGMENT. THE NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR RETAIL LOANS IN 2004 WAS 0.67%, AN INCREASE OF 27 BASIS POINTS FROM 2003.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER AND TO $406 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE $4 BILLION

MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO.

FUTURE RFS CHARGE-OFFS AND CREDIT QUALITY ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM CURRENT ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING THE DIRECTION AND LEVEL OF LOAN

DELINQUENCIES, CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, BANKRUPTCY TRENDS, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, INTEREST RATE

MOVEMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MIX, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

THE FIRM PROACTIVELY MANAGES ITS RETAIL CREDIT OPERATION. ONGOING EFFORTS INCLUDE CONTINUAL REVIEW

AND ENHANCEMENT OF CREDIT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND REFINEMENT OF PRICING AND RISK MANAGEMENT

MODELS.

HOME FINANCE.

HOME FINANCE LOANS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WERE $125 BILLION.

THIS CONSISTED OF $68 BILLION OF HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS AND $57 BILLION OF MORTGAGES,

INCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE. HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED

MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS, A PRODUCT THE FIRM STOPPED ORIGINATING AT MID-YEAR 2004; THE FIRM SOLD

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO AT THE END OF 2004. THE $125 BILLION IN

HOME FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF $50 BILLION FROM YEAR-END

2003, DRIVEN BY THE ADDITION OF BANK ONES HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. HOME FINANCE

PROVIDES REAL ESTATE LENDING TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CREDIT

BORROWERS, WHICH INCLUDED $7 BILLION IN SUB-PRIME CREDITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUTSTANDING

AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE LOANS INCREASED TO $63

BILLION, UP FROM $43 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2003. THE ACQUISITION OF THE BANK ONE PORTFOLIO WAS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE. THE AUTO & EDUCATION LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF

PRIME QUALITY CREDITS. DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE FIRM COMPLETED A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF ALL CONSUMER

LENDING PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS. THIS REVIEW RESULTED IN THE FIRM CHOOSING TO DE-EMPHASIZE VEHICLE

LEASING, WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPRISED $8 BILLION OF OUTSTANDINGS. IT IS ANTICIPATED

THAT OVER TIME VEHICLE LEASES WILL ACCOUNT FOR A SMALLER SHARE OF BALANCE SHEET RECEIVABLES AND

EXPOSURE. THE STRATEGIC REVIEW ALSO RESULTED IN THE SALE OF A $2 BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE

PORTFOLIO IN EARLY 2005.

CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS/INSURANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, SMALL BUSINESS & OTHER CONSUMER LOANS

INCREASED TO $15 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2003 YEAR-END LEVELS OF $4 BILLION. THIS PORTFOLIO SEGMENT

IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE ACQUISITION OF

THE BANK ONE SMALL BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTS HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN

WITH PERSONAL LOAN GUARANTEES.

CARD SERVICES

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS THROUGH

SECURITIZATION. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES WERE $135 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN INCREASE

OF $83 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2003, REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF THE BANK ONE PORTFOLIO.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OVERALL, REFLECTING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

AND REDUCED CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY FILINGS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN THE MANAGED CREDIT

CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE, TO 5.27% IN 2004 FROM 5.90% IN 2003, REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER,

AS WELL AS MANAGEMENTS CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON PRUDENT CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING

DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TARGETED TO THE PRIME AND SUPER-PRIME

CREDIT SECTORS. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS USED TO MANAGE THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF LOSSES FOR

CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY UPDATED, AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE TOOLS WERE

ADJUSTED TO REDUCE CREDIT RISK. THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A

WELL-SEASONED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

FUTURE CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO AND OVERALL CREDIT QUALITY ARE SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES, WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM HISTORIC PERFORMANCE. THIS COULD

INCLUDE THE DIRECTION AND LEVEL OF LOAN DELINQUENCIES, CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, BANKRUPTCY

TRENDS, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MIX, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. WHILE

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND CREDIT DATA SUGGEST THAT CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY

DETERIORATE, SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THESE

EXPECTATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES, INCLUDING LOSSES WHERE THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS

NOT BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY

THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND THE DEPUTY CHIEF RISK OFFICER OF THE FIRM AND IS DISCUSSED WITH A RISK

SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED BASED ON THAT REVIEW IF, IN

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE

INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, THE LATTER OF WHICH CONSISTS OF

A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE

FIRM ON PAGE 77 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES 102-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004,

MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE

INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED OR FOR WHICH THE SIZE OF THE

LOSS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY DETERMINED.

OVERALL.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED BY $3.0 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31,

2003, TO DECEMBER 31, 2004, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE MERGER. ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO THE

COMBINED FIRMS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY, AND ALIGNMENT OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES RELATED TO THE

SELLERS INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, RESULTED IN A NET INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES OF $858 MILLION. SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 102-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS.

THE ALLOWANCE HAS TWO COMPONENTS: ASSET-SPECIFIC AND FORMULA-BASED. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE TO BE APPROPRIATE. EXCLUDING LOANS HELD FOR SALE, THE ALLOWANCE

REPRESENTED 1.94% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED WITH 2.33% AT YEAR-END 2003.

THE WHOLESALE COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $3.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN INCREASE FROM

YEAR-END 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE ALSO REFLECTED A REDUCTION OF

$103 MILLION IN THE PROVISION AS A RESULT OF CONFORMING THE COMBINED FIRMS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY.

THE CONSUMER COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS $4.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN INCREASE FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2003, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER AND THE DECERTIFICATION OF BANK ONES

SELLERS RETAINED INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO THE

COMBINED FIRMS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY INCLUDED A REDUCTION OF $192 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES WITHIN RFS. CONFORMING THE METHODOLOGY WITHIN CARD SERVICES REDUCED THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES BY $62 MILLION.

68

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONALLY, IN CARD SERVICES, $128 MILLION IN ALLOWANCE FOR ACCRUED FEES AND FINANCE CHARGES

WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO LOANS.

AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, BANK ONES SELLERS INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS WAS IN A

CERTIFICATED OR SECURITY FORM AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENTLY, A DECISION WAS MADE TO

DECERTIFICATE THESE ASSETS, WHICH RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION OF THE SELLERS INTEREST FROM

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES TO LOANS, AT FAIR VALUE, WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

GENERALLY, AS THE UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES REPRESENTED BY THE SELLERS INTEREST WERE PAID

OFF, CUSTOMERS CONTINUED TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS AND ORIGINATE NEW RECEIVABLES, WHICH WERE THEN

RECORDED AS LOANS AT HISTORICAL COST. AS THESE NEW LOANS AGED, IT WAS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH AN

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS CREDIT POLICIES. DURING THE SECOND HALF OF

2004, APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE PROVISION

ASSOCIATED WITH NEWLY ORIGINATED RECEIVABLES RELATED TO THE SELLERS INTEREST.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF

EXTENDING CREDIT, MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED

COMPONENT FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR

TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES

OF DRAWDOWN. THIS ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS $492 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, AND REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $227 MILLION BENEFIT AS A

RESULT OF CONFORMING THE COMBINED FIRMS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. THE ALLOWANCE WAS $324 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, AND EQUITY AND COMMODITY PRICES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (MRM) IS A FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES THAT

IDENTIFIES, MEASURES, MONITORS, AND CONTROLS MARKET RISK. IT SEEKS TO

FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS AND TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IT

STRIVES TO MAKE THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

THE CHART BELOW DEPICTS THE MRM ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND DESCRIBES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE

GROUPS WITHIN MRM.

THERE ARE ALSO GROUPS THAT REPORT TO THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH SOME RESPONSIBILITY

FOR MARKET RISK-RELATED ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA, THE VALUATION CONTROL

FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE

FIRM TO MARKET RISK.

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

MRM WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE

FIRM, AND TO REFINE AND MONITOR MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF MARKET RISKS WITHIN THEIR UNITS.

RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES HAVE MIDDLE OFFICE FUNCTIONS THAT ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM TRADING PERSONNEL

AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK EXPOSURES THAT THE BUSINESS TAKES. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT FOR MARKET RISK ARISING FROM THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MRM IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE

FOR IDENTIFYING EXPOSURES WHICH MAY NOT BE LARGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BUT WHICH MAY

BE LARGE FOR THE FIRM IN AGGREGATE. WEEKLY MEETINGS ARE HELD BETWEEN MRM AND THE HEADS OF

RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES, TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE ON RISK EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT FLOWS.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRADING AND

NONTRADING RISK. TRADING RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS THAT ARE HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AS A PRINCIPAL

OR AS PART OF A BUSINESS WHOSE MAIN BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO TRADE OR MAKE MARKETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED IN TRADING REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK INCLUDES

SECURITIES HELD FOR LONGER TERM INVESTMENT, AND SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE

FIRMS ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES. IN MOST CASES, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED IN NET INCOME OR OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TRADING RISK

FIXED INCOME.

FIXED INCOME RISK (WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT SPREAD RISK) INVOLVES THE POTENTIAL

DECLINE IN NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH

MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO NII, SECURITIES VALUATIONS, AND OTHER INTEREST-SENSITIVE REVENUES AND

EXPENSES.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES, COMMODITIES AND OTHER.

THESE RISKS INVOLVE THE POTENTIAL

DECLINE IN NET INCOME TO THE FIRM DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES OR

COMMODITIES MARKETS, WHETHER DUE TO PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM, OR DUE TO A DECREASE

IN THE LEVEL OF CLIENT ACTIVITY. OTHER RISKS INCLUDE PASSIVE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN NUMEROUS

HEDGE FUNDS THAT MAY HAVE EXPOSURE TO FIXED INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISK

WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIO RISK STRUCTURES.

NONTRADING RISK

THE EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS CORE BUSINESS STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS THE FIRM UNDERTAKES TO RISK-MANAGE STRUCTURAL

EXPOSURES GIVE RISE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE NONTRADING ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM.

70

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS EXPOSURE CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE

MATURITY OR RE-PRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL AND SHAPE OF MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES MAY ALSO CREATE INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE

RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE IN RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF

TWO FLOATING RATE INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND 3-MONTH LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE

FIRMS PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT IMPACT PRICING AND BALANCE LEVELS.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED,

CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A

TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN

BE RISK MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND

CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT

EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR RE-PRICING, AND ANY

INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE

REVIEWED BY TREASURY.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES ALSO GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE INTEREST

RATE EXPOSURE FROM THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES IS A RESULT OF OPTION AND BASIS RISKS.

OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE

PROBABILITY OF NEWLY-ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM

DIFFERENT RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES AND OTHER INTEREST RATES. THESE RISKS ARE

MANAGED THROUGH PROGRAMS SPECIFIC TO THE DIFFERENT MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES. POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION

LEVELS OF MSRS ARE MANAGED VIA A RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ATTEMPTS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES. A

SIMILAR APPROACH IS USED TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS MORTGAGE

ORIGINATION BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES SEVERAL

MEASURES, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



STATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

-

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)

-

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

-

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTS

-

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTS

-

OTHER MEASURES OF POSITION SIZE AND SENSITIVITY TO MARKET MOVES

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, VAR, GAUGES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET

MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF RISK

PROFILES AND LEVELS OF RISK DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED TO COMPARE RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES, TO

MONITOR LIMITS AND TO ALLOCATE ECONOMIC CAPITAL TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. VAR PROVIDES RISK

TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT.

EACH BUSINESS DAY THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES BOTH ITS

TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES. VAR FOR NONTRADING ACTIVITIES MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL CHANGE IN ECONOMIC VALUE; HOWEVER, VAR FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS NOT A MEASURE OF REPORTED

REVENUE SINCE NONTRADING ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS. JPMORGAN

CHASES VAR CALCULATION IS HIGHLY GRANULAR, COMPRISING MORE THAN 2.1 MILLION POSITIONS AND 240,000

PRICING SERIES (E.G., SECURITIES PRICES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES). FOR A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS EXPOSURE, THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED FULL-REVALUATION VAR, WHICH, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES,

GENERATES THE MOST ACCURATE RESULTS.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND

PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT, COMPARABLE WAY. THIS APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET

VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES. THE SIMULATION IS BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12

MONTHS.

THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR USING A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THE

FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN EVERY

100 TRADING DAYS, OR ABOUT 2.5 TIMES A YEAR.

ALL STATISTICAL MODELS INVOLVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, DEPENDING ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THEY EMPLOY.

THE FIRM PREFERS HISTORICAL SIMULATION, BECAUSE IT INVOLVES FEWER ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PORTFOLIO LOSSES THAN PARAMETER-BASED METHODOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM

REGULARLY ASSESSES THE QUALITY OF THE MARKET DATA, SINCE THEIR ACCURACY IS CRITICAL TO COMPUTING

VAR. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE VAR IS BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET DATA, IT MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT

FUTURE RISK DURING ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH MARKET VOLATILITY IS CHANGING. IN ADDITION, THE VAR

MEASURE ON ANY PARTICULAR DAY MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RISK LEVELS, SINCE POSITIONS AND

MARKET CONDITIONS MAY BOTH CHANGE OVER TIME.

WHILE VAR IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR EVALUATING RELATIVE RISKS AND AGGREGATING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES,

IT ONLY MEASURES THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF DAILY REVENUES. PROFITABILITY AND RISK LEVELS OVER

LONGER TIME PERIODS  A FISCAL QUARTER OR A YEAR  MAY BE ONLY LOOSELY RELATED TO THE AVERAGE VALUE

OF VAR OVER THOSE PERIODS FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, WHILE VAR MEASURES POTENTIAL

FLUCTUATIONS AROUND AVERAGE DAILY REVENUE, THE AVERAGE ITSELF COULD REFLECT SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR

LOSSES; FOR EXAMPLE, FROM CLIENT REVENUES THAT ACCOMPANY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. SECOND, LARGE

TRADING REVENUES MAY RESULT FROM POSITIONS TAKEN OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, A

BUSINESS MAY MAINTAIN AN EXPOSURE TO RISING OR FALLING INTEREST RATES OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS OR

MONTHS. IF THE MARKET EXHIBITS A LONG-TERM TREND OVER THAT TIME, THE BUSINESS COULD EXPERIENCE

LARGE GAINS OR LOSSES, EVEN THOUGH REVENUE VOLATILITY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL DAY MAY HAVE BEEN SMALL.

DESIGNATED AS NM BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DIFFERENT

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASES AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END VARS ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF

ITS MARKET RISK COMPONENTS, DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION.

(E)

AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE RECLASSIFICATION OF HEDGE FUND INVESTMENTS,

RECLASSIFICATION OF TREASURY POSITIONS TO PORTFOLIOS OUTSIDE THE IB, AND THE INCLUSION OF

AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES

HELD FOR THE IBS PROPRIETARY PURPOSES.

THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE IB TRADING VAR IN 2004 WAS FIXED INCOME RISK. BEFORE

PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION, FIXED INCOME RISK ACCOUNTED FOR ROUGHLY 58% OF THE AVERAGE IB TRADING

PORTFOLIO VAR. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT, WHICH ON AVERAGE REDUCED THE DAILY AVERAGE IB TRADING

PORTFOLIO VAR BY $43.6 MILLION IN 2004, REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE LARGEST LOSSES FOR DIFFERENT

POSITIONS AND RISKS DO NOT TYPICALLY OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS

IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES. THE DEGREE OF

DIVERSIFICATION IS DETERMINED BOTH BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT MARKET VARIABLES TEND TO MOVE

TOGETHER AND BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT BUSINESSES HAVE SIMILAR POSITIONS.

AVERAGE IB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR DURING 2004 ROSE TO $90.5 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $69.3

MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2003. PERIOD-END VAR DECREASED OVER THE SAME PERIOD, TO $77.7

MILLION FROM $101.1 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES VAR,

PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED RISK POSITIONS AND LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE

OF A YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS TRADING POSITIONS CHANGE AND MARKET VOLATILITY

FLUCTUATES.

VAR BACKTESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACKTESTING OF VAR AGAINST

ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS, BASED ON DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE. MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE

IS DEFINED AS THE DAILY CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET TRADING PORTFOLIOS PLUS ANY

TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE. THE

FIRMS DEFINITION OF MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FRBS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

BASEL COMMITTEES MARKET RISK CAPITAL RULES. THE HISTOGRAM BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET

RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE IB TRADING BUSINESSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE CHART SHOWS THAT THE IB POSTED MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS ON 224 OUT OF 261 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD,

WITH 12 DAYS EXCEEDING $100 MILLION. THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH THE IB

EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE

DAYS. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 37 DAYS, WITH NO LOSS GREATER THAN $50 MILLION, AND WITH NO LOSS

EXCEEDING THE VAR MEASURE.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO UNLIKELY EVENTS IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING

CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. STRESS TESTING

IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS VAR IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES THE

UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL AND IS USED FOR MONITORING LIMITS,

CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MEASUREMENT AND ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS PORTFOLIOS.

APPLYING ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS HELPS THE FIRM UNDERSTAND HOW THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS

BALANCE SHEET (I.E., NOT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP) WOULD CHANGE UNDER CERTAIN

SCENARIOS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS FOR BOTH ITS TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING

ACTIVITIES, USING THE SAME SCENARIOS FOR BOTH.

THE FIRM STRESS TESTS ITS PORTFOLIOS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS. SEVERAL

MACROECONOMIC EVENT-RELATED SCENARIOS ARE EVALUATED ACROSS THE FIRM, WITH SHOCKS TO ROUGHLY 10,000

MARKET PRICES SPECIFIED FOR EACH SCENARIO. ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS PREDOMINANT IN

INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND INCLUDE SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE MOVES

IN COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS.

SCENARIOS ARE DERIVED FROM EITHER SEVERE HISTORICAL CRISES OR FORWARD ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPING

MARKET TRENDS. THEY ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK

PROFILE AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED EACH MONTH

TO THE FIRMS EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO HELP THEM BETTER MEASURE AND

MANAGE RISKS TO UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

THE FIRMS STRESS-TEST METHODOLOGY ASSUMES THAT, DURING AN ACTUAL STRESS EVENT, NO MANAGEMENT

ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN TO CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE OF PORTFOLIOS. THIS CAPTURES THE DECREASED

LIQUIDITY THAT OFTEN OCCURS WITH ABNORMAL MARKETS AND RESULTS, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, IN A

CONSERVATIVE STRESS-TEST RESULT.

BASED ON THE FIRMS STRESS SCENARIOS, THE STRESS TEST LOSS (PRE-TAX) IN THE IBS TRADING PORTFOLIO

RANGED FROM $202 MILLION TO $1.2 BILLION, AND $227 MILLION TO $895 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. (THE 2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED

FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. IN ADDITION, THE 2003 AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER OF TREASURY POSITIONS FROM THE IB TO THE CORPORATE

BUSINESS SEGMENT.)

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT VAR RESULTS CANNOT BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO STRESS-TEST LOSS RESULTS

FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, STRESS-TEST LOSSES ARE CALCULATED AT VARYING DATES EACH MONTH, WHILE VAR

IS PERFORMED DAILY AND REPORTED FOR THE PERIOD-END DATE. SECOND, VAR AND STRESS TESTS ARE TWO

DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS YIELDING VERY DIFFERENT LOSS POTENTIALS. THUS, ALTHOUGH THE SAME TRADING

PORTFOLIOS ARE USED FOR BOTH TESTS, VAR IS BASED ON A DISTRIBUTION OF ONE-DAY HISTORICAL LOSSES

MEASURED OVER THE MOST RECENT ONE YEAR; IN CONTRAST, STRESS TESTING SUBJECTS THE PORTFOLIO TO MORE

EXTREME, LARGER MOVES OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON (E.G., 2-3 WEEKS). THIRD, AS VAR AND STRESS TESTS

ARE DISTINCT RISK MEASUREMENTS, THE IMPACT OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION CAN VARY GREATLY. FOR VAR,

MARKETS CAN CHANGE IN PATTERNS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON, MOVING FROM HIGHLY CORRELATED TO LESS

SO; IN STRESS TESTING, THE FOCUS IS ON A SINGLE EVENT AND THE ASSOCIATED CORRELATIONS IN AN EXTREME

MARKET SITUATION. AS A RESULT, WHILE VAR OVER A GIVEN TIME HORIZON CAN BE LOWERED BY A

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT IN THE PORTFOLIO, THIS BENEFIT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MANIFEST ITSELF IN

STRESS-TEST SCENARIOS, WHICH ASSUME LARGE, COHERENT MOVES ACROSS ALL MARKETS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

RIFLE

IN ADDITION TO VAR, JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYS THE RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

METHODOLOGY AS ANOTHER STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE. THE FIRM REQUIRES THAT ALL MARKET RISK-TAKING

BUSINESSES SELF-ASSESS THEIR RISKS TO UNUSUAL AND SPECIFIC EVENTS. INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK

POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY COMPLEX POSITIONS, IDENTIFY POTENTIAL WORST-CASE LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE

FROM AN UNUSUAL OR SPECIFIC EVENT, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL TAX CHANGE, AND ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITIES

OF SUCH LOSSES. THROUGH THE FIRMS RIFLE SYSTEM, THIS INFORMATION IS THEN DIRECTED TO THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT, THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO IDENTIFY FURTHER EARNINGS

VULNERABILITIES NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY VAR AND STRESS TESTING.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT

VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AN EXPOSURES SIZE AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS MOVING.

NONSTATISTICAL MEASURES ARE USED FOR MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND TACTICAL CONTROL.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF

THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON

REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO CRITICAL. INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE NONTRADING

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON- AND OFF-BALANCE

SHEET POSITIONS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF NII FOR ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES UNDER A VARIETY

OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SCENARIOS USED FOR ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS

TESTING. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME OVER

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THESE TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS THE

RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND

CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDED FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES

AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

JPMORGAN CHASES 12-MONTH PRE-TAX EARNINGS SENSITIVITY PROFILES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WERE

AS FOLLOWS.

DECEMBER 31, 2004

$(557

$(164

$(180

)

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO BOTH RISING AND FALLING RATES. THE FIRMS RISK TO RISING RATES IS

LARGELY THE RESULT OF INCREASED FUNDING COSTS. IN CONTRAST, THE EXPOSURE TO FALLING RATES IS THE

RESULT OF POTENTIAL COMPRESSION IN DEPOSIT SPREADS, COUPLED WITH HIGHER ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF LOAN

PREPAYMENTS.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS ARE ALSO REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE,

NONPARALLEL RATE SHIFTS AND SEVERE INTEREST RATE SHOCKS ON SELECTED KEY RATES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE

INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS-AT-RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE OF

OUTCOMES.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK CAN ALSO RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS

THE ABILITY TO LEND AT FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED ON THESE

SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASE

IN SHORT-TERM RATES WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES. CONVERSELY, HIGHER

LONG-TERM RATES ARE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT

ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS PRIMARILY CONTROLLED THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. THE SIZES OF THE LIMITS REFLECT

THE FIRMS RISK APPETITE AFTER EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY.

THE ANALYSIS EXAMINES FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRACK RECORD,

AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND DEPTH.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS ENCOMPASS VAR CALCULATIONS

AND STRESS-TEST LOSS ADVISORIES. SIMILARLY, BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVELS INCLUDE LIMITS BASED ON VAR

CALCULATIONS AND NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS, AND P&L LOSS ADVISORIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED DAILY.

EXCEEDED LIMITS ARE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS UNIT MUST

TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS. IF THE BUSINESS CANNOT DO THIS WITHIN AN

ACCEPTABLE TIMEFRAME, SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS CONSULTED ON THE APPROPRIATE ACTION.

MRM REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS, AND THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND

APPROVES RISK LIMITS AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR. MRM FURTHER CONTROLS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE BY

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATING APPROVED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR EACH BUSINESS UNIT.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

MRM ALSO PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF BOTH BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK

IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL MARKET RISK. THE BUSINESSES MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED.

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

MANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE

INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING RISK AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. A MODEL REVIEW GROUP, INDEPENDENT OF THE

LINES OF BUSINESS UNITS AND MRM, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE FIRM USES, AND ASSESSES MODEL

APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS BUSINESSES. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF ISSUES.

APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MODEL, ASSESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND CAPTURES ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS; INDEPENDENCE AND RELIABILITY

OF DATA SOURCES; APPROPRIATENESS AND ADEQUACY OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS; AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT

PARAMETERS OR OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED FOR NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, AND THEY

ASSESS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE ACCEPTED MODELS; WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN

ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY; AND WHETHER THERE ARE

THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR

A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON

PAGES 77-79 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

VALUE-AT-RISK, NONSTATISTICAL EXPOSURES AND DOLLAR TRADING LOSS LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE REPORTED

DAILY FOR EACH TRADING AND NONTRADING BUSINESS. MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TRENDS, VALUE-AT-RISK TRENDS,

PROFIT AND LOSS CHANGES, AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS ARE REPORTED WEEKLY TO BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

AND MONTHLY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE, MONTHLY STRESS TESTS

ARE PRESENTED TO BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR

SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS, OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS,

INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTSOURCING

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM,

INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND

A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE

GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS

AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND

UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

MAY GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

IN 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE

REDESIGNED THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE OF ITS FIRMWIDE SELF-ASSESSMENT

PROCESS, AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTING THE PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE HERITAGE BANK ONE BUSINESS UNITS. THE

GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS

SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS.

ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

ALL BUSINESSES WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEMIANNUAL SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN 2004, WHICH WERE COMPLETED

BY THE BUSINESSES THROUGH THE USE OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE FIRM. GOING FORWARD,

THE FIRM WILL UTILIZE THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF

ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND

BY RISK EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST

AGAINST SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE LINES OF

BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND

SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN

OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO

PROVIDE CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND SUPPORT AREAS.

DURING 2004, THE FIRM IMPLEMENTED PHOENIX, A NEW INTERNALLY-DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK

ARCHITECTURE MODEL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, PHOENIX WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO

ENHANCE ITS REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK DATA, LEADING TO IMPROVED RISK MANAGEMENT

AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. PHOENIX WILL ALSO FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO LEVERAGE

EXISTING PROCESSES TO COMPLY WITH RISK MANAGEMENT-RELATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THEREBY LEADING

TO INCREASED EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT

ASSESSMENT OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY

COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING. INTERNAL AUDIT PARTNERS WITH BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE

CONTROL COMMUNITY IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, AND REVIEWS THE

EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS UNIT

AUDITS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY, CREDIT,

MARKET, OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE

MAINTENANCE AMONG MANY CONSTITUENTS 

CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A REPUTATION FOR BUSINESS

PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY.

ATTENTION TO REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF

REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL

RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS: THROUGH THE CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, POLICIES AND OVERSIGHT

FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE, WHICH

EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR ROLE FOR THE

FIRM.

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

THE FIRM HAS AN ADDITIONAL STRUCTURE TO ADDRESS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY

COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS, THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REPUTATION.

THIS STRUCTURE REINFORCES THE FIRMS PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING

TRANSACTIONS IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL ISSUES AND REPUTATIONAL RISK, AND IT INTENSIFIES

THE FIRMS SCRUTINY OF THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW,

WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS NOT BE USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR OTHERS. THE STRUCTURE

OPERATES AT THREE LEVELS: AS PART OF EVERY BUSINESSS TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS; THROUGH REVIEW

BY REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES; AND THROUGH OVERSIGHT BY THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS REPUTATION

RISK LIES WITH THE BUSINESS UNITS CONDUCTING THE TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION. THE FIRMS TRANSACTION

APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES REVIEW AND SIGN-OFF FROM, AMONG OTHERS, INTERNAL LEGAL/COMPLIANCE,

CONFLICTS, TAX AND ACCOUNTING GROUPS. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING AN SPE ESTABLISHED BY THE FIRM RECEIVE

PARTICULAR SCRUTINY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SUCH ENTITY IS PROPERLY APPROVED, DOCUMENTED, MONITORED

AND CONTROLLED.

BUSINESS UNITS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO REGIONAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEES PROPOSED

TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY HEIGHTEN REPUTATION RISK  PARTICULARLY A

CLIENTS MOTIVATION AND ITS INTENDED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OF THE TRANSACTION. THE COMMITTEES

APPROVE, REJECT OR REQUIRE FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON OR CHANGES TO THE TRANSACTIONS. THE MEMBERS OF

THESE COMMITTEES ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS AND SUPPORT UNITS IN THE REGION. THE

COMMITTEES MAY ESCALATE TRANSACTION REVIEW TO THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE IS THE MOST SENIOR APPROVAL LEVEL FOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

REPUTATION RISK ISSUES. THE MANDATE OF THE OFFICE IS TO OPINE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS BROUGHT BY

THE REGIONAL COMMITTEES AND CONSIDER CHANGES IN POLICIES OR PRACTICES RELATING TO REPUTATION RISK.

THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE CONSULTS WITH THE FIRMS MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AND

PROVIDES REGULAR UPDATES. ASIDE FROM GOVERNANCE AND GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, THE

OBJECTIVE OF THE POLICY REVIEW PROCESS IS TO REINFORCE A CULTURE, THROUGH A CASE STUDY APPROACH,

THAT ENSURES THAT ALL EMPLOYEES, REGARDLESS OF SENIORITY, UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF

REPUTATION RISK CONTROL AND CAN RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAINTAINS RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH OF ITS LINES OF BUSINESS THAT INCLUDE

IN THEIR MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT OF LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND FIDUCIARY-RELATED RISKS IN THEIR

BUSINESSES THAT MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE FIDUCIARY RISK

MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS WITH THE LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES

PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD

RELATIVE TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT, WHETHER IT BE FIDUCIARY OR NON-FIDUCIARY IN NATURE.

OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A

CLIENT INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION, DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, DISCLOSURE

COMMUNICATIONS AND PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY THE FIRM. IN THIS WAY, THE LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES,

TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO

MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

TO CLIENTS, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM THE FIRMS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDERTAKEN ON BEHALF OF

EMPLOYEES.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS EMPLOYS PROCESSES FOR RISK MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL OF

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR OTHER BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FIRM. THE

PROCESSES ARE COORDINATED WITH THE FIRMS OVERALL APPROACH TO MARKET AND CONCENTRATION RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS INITIALLY MONITORED THROUGH THE USE OF INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS.

ADDITIONALLY, TO MANAGE THE PACE OF NEW INVESTMENTS, A CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENT ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO WAS $7.5 BILLION.

PRIVATE EQUITYS PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES CREATE A SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO GENERAL

DECLINES IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. INITIALLY TO GAUGE THAT RISK, VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES ARE

CALCULATED IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY ARE FOR THE FIRMS TRADING

AND NONTRADING PORTFOLIOS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE VAR ASSUMES THAT POSITIONS CAN BE EXITED IN A NORMAL

MARKET, JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES THAT THE VAR FOR PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES DOES NOT

NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE TRUE VALUE-AT-RISK FOR THESE HOLDINGS NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF THE LOSS

POTENTIAL FOR THESE HOLDINGS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE POSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SALE

RESTRICTIONS AND, OFTEN, REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF OWNERSHIP. ACCORDINGLY, PRIVATE

EQUITY MANAGEMENT UNDERTAKES FREQUENT REVIEWS OF ITS PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

AS PART OF A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO SALES AND RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES. RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE

LIMITED BUT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN PRACTICAL AND AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE. OVER TIME, THE FIRM MAY

CHANGE THE NATURE AND TYPE OF PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS IT ENTERS INTO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING

ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO

ASCERTAIN THE VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND

CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART

OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD

TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR

CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR

DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS

WELL AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF

THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE

FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 102-103 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. SECOND,

IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO

EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND TO REFINE LOSS

FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED

INCLUDE THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS,

THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH,

AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN

EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND

INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY BE

RELEVANT IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY AN

EXPLICIT PART OF THE FIRMS METHODOLOGY, COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT

LOAN.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THESE

LOSS FACTORS ARE DETERMINED BY FACILITY STRUCTURE, COLLATERAL AND TYPE OF OBLIGOR. WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE

IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THESE LOSS FACTORS. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF

LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE

OVER THE ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE. THE APPLICATION OF

DIFFERENT LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT FAC-

TORS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

SIMILARLY, THERE ARE JUDGMENTS AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA ON PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT SHOULD BE USED,

AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC LOAN

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE LOSS FACTORS DERIVED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET

REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. THE RESULTANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION OF LOSSES

ON THE PERFORMING PORTFOLIO ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED RANGES USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND

DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO. THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $990 MILLION, THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE, BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CONSUMER LOANS

FOR SCORED LOANS (GENERALLY CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS), LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING

STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. THESE LOSS

ESTIMATES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT BUREAU SCORES, THE REALIZABLE

VALUE OF COLLATERAL, AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL

LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE RANGE OF CREDIT LOSS

EXPERIENCED FOR EACH MAJOR PORTFOLIO SEGMENT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC CYCLES, PORTFOLIO

SEASONING, AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND THEN FORMULATES A RANGE THAT INCORPORATES RELEVANT RISK

FACTORS THAT IMPACT OVERALL CREDIT PERFORMANCE. THE RECORDED ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS $1.0 BILLION, BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING TRADING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AFS SECURITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF FAIR VALUE OR COST. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, APPROXIMATELY $417 BILLION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR

ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT UTILIZE INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING

INTEREST RATE YIELD CURVES, OPTION VOLATILITIES AND CURRENCY RATES.

THE DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. FOR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRADED AND HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PARAMETERS READILY

AVAILABLE,

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THERE IS LITTLE TO NO SUBJECTIVITY IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES AND PARAMETERS DO NOT EXIST, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE

VALUATION PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS

AND, FOR THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (SEE THE DISCUSSION OF CVA ON PAGE 63

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS OFTEN LIMITED MARKET DATA TO RELY ON WHEN ESTIMATING

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LARGE OR AGED POSITION. SIMILARLY, JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED IN ESTIMATING

PRICES FOR LESS READILY OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL PARAMETERS. FINALLY, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS MODEL

ASSUMPTIONS, MARKET DISLOCATIONS AND UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A

PARTICULAR POSITION.

TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES HELD FOR TRADING AND INVESTMENT PURPOSES (LONG

POSITIONS) AND SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (SHORT

POSITIONS) ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SECURITIES ARE LESS ACTIVELY

TRADED AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO BE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE

DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AS THIS DETERMINATION MAY REQUIRE

BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE

CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES.

AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL

SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-PRICING SERVICES. CERTAIN DERIVATIVES, HOWEVER, ARE VALUED BASED ON

MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MAY BE ESTIMATED

AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO SUBSTANTIATE THE MODEL VALUATION. THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER LESS ACTIVELY TRADED OR TRADE ACTIVITY IS ONE-WAY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE

LONG-DATED INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY SWAPS, WHERE SWAP RATES MAY BE UNOBSERVABLE FOR LONGER

MATURITIES, AND CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHERE CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE UNOBSERVABLE. DUE

TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THE FIRM DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED IN TRADING REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS

AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INCLUDES RECORDING FAIR

VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (I.E., REDUCTIONS) TO MODEL VALUATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY WHEN

VALUING COMPLEX OR LESS ACTIVELY TRADED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE

FIRMS TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS BY VALUATION METHODOLOGY AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

BASED ON GROSS MARK-TO-MARKET VALUATIONS OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO PRIOR TO NETTING

POSITIONS PURSUANT TO FIN 39, AS CROSS-PRODUCT NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO AN ANALYSIS BASED UPON

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

TO ENSURE THAT THE VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS CONTROLS IN

PLACE. THESE INCLUDE: AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF VALUATION MODELS; DETAILED REVIEW AND

EXPLANATION FOR PROFIT AND LOSS ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME; DECOMPOSING THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR

CERTAIN STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT.

AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE

TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM REFINES ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE

FINANCE AREA, A GROUP INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE

ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF POSITIONS TAKEN WITHIN THE INVESTMENT BANK.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE MODEL REVIEW PROCESS, SEE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 70-74 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE FIRMS VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES 121-124 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS, ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK THAT IS DISCOUNTED USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT

INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

VALUATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK

OF LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED

BASED ON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN

ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY PRIVATE EQUITYS SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE

REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE

AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, INDUSTRY VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN MARKET

OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT OVER TIME. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE

FINANCE AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE

INVESTMENTS HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

SEE THE PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 76 AND NOTE 9 ON PAGES 98-100 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY

OBSERVABLE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, BUT THE PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE

TYPICALLY NOT READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN

OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. FOR MSRS,

THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES AND

PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE

AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. FOR OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS (SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY

STRIPS), THE MODEL IS GENERALLY BASED ON PROJECTIONS OF FINANCE CHARGES RELATED TO THE SECURITIZED

ASSETS, NET CREDIT LOSSES, AVERAGE LIFE, AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAID TO THE THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS VALUATION OF

RETAINED INTERESTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FAIR VALUES AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN

THE MODELS ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS AND MSRS, AS

WELL AS THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTES 13 AND 15 ON PAGES 103-106 AND

109-111, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE

FIRM TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES,

SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR

CONDUCTING AN INTERIM TEST. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING-UNIT LEVEL (WHICH IS

GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 31 ON PAGES 126-127 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY WHICH IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST

IS A COMPARISON, AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, THEN THE

SECOND PART OF THE TEST IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE

IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL IS CALCULATED AND COMPARED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF GOODWILL RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RECORDS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF REPORTING UNIT

GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL, THEN THE FIRM WOULD RECOGNIZE AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE, WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE AGAINST NET

INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS BASED ON

EACH REPORTING UNITS INTERNAL FORECASTS. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS USING MARKET-BASED TRADING AND

TRANSACTION MULTIPLES, WHERE AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS

DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS.

GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 OR DECEMBER 31, 2003, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL

WRITTEN OFF DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND

2002. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 109 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE NATURE AND ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL

AND THE CARRYING VALUES OF GOODWILL BY MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE TRADES NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY

CONTRACTS. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON INTERNAL MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS. THE FIRMS NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY ENERGY-RELATED

CONTRACTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR NONEXCHANGE-TRADED

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP SFAS 109-2, WHICH PROVIDES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE

FOR THE FOREIGN EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE

ACT). THE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON OCTOBER 22, 2004.

THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY PROVIDING A DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON

THE REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION PROVISION).

THE NEW DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.

CLARIFICATION TO KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION FROM CONGRESS OR THE U.S. TREASURY

DEPARTMENT MAY AFFECT AN ENTERPRISES EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF THE ACT ON ITS PLAN FOR

REPATRIATION OR REINVESTMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE FSP PROVIDES A PRACTICAL EXCEPTION TO THE

SFAS 109 REQUIREMENT TO REFLECT THE EFFECT OF A NEW TAX LAW IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT, BECAUSE OF

THE LACK OF CLARIFICATION TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS WITHIN THE ACT AND THE TIMING OF THE ENACTMENT.

THUS, COMPANIES HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE ACT ON ITS PLAN FOR REINVESTMENT

OR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS 109. A COMPANY

SHOULD APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 109 (I.E., REFLECT THE TAX IMPACT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT MAKES THE DECISION TO REPATRIATE OR REINVEST UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACT. DECISIONS CAN BE MADE IN STAGES (E.G., BY FOREIGN COUNTRY). THE

REPATRIATION PROVISION IS EFFECTIVE FOR EITHER THE 2004 OR 2005 TAX YEARS FOR CALENDAR YEAR

TAXPAYERS.

THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR REPATRIATION UNDER THIS PROVISION IS

BETWEEN ZERO AND $1.9 BILLION. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE REPATRIATION

PROVISION AND, AT THIS TIME, CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATED RANGE OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF

SUCH REPATRIATION PROVISION. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT REFLECTED THE TAX EFFECT OF THE

REPATRIATION PROVISION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR INCOME TAX LIABILITIES.

ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 123R, WHICH REVISES SFAS 123 AND SUPERSEDES APB 25.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING UNDER SFAS 123R IS GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THE SFAS 123 APPROACH. HOWEVER,

SFAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE

IS NO LONGER AN ALTERNATIVE.

80

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM HAS CONTINUED TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002 UNDER APB 25 USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. THEREFORE, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR SOME

PREVIOUSLY GRANTED AWARDS THAT WAS NOT RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS 123 WILL BE RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS

123R. HAD THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 123R IN PRIOR PERIODS, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATED THE

IMPACT OF SFAS 123 AS DESCRIBED IN THE DISCLOSURE OF PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS

PRESENTED IN NOTE 7 ON PAGE 97 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SFAS 123R MUST BE ADOPTED NO LATER THAN JULY

1, 2005. SFAS 123R PERMITS ADOPTION USING ONE OF TWO METHODS  MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED

RETROSPECTIVE. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING BOTH THE TIMING AND METHOD OF ADOPTING THE NEW

STANDARD.

IMPAIRMENT OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP EITF 03-1-1, INDEFINITELY DELAYING THE MEASUREMENT

PROVISIONS OF EITF 03-1. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF EITF 03-1 REMAIN EFFECTIVE AND ARE INCLUDED

IN NOTE 9 ON PAGES 98-100 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. EITF 03-1 ADDRESSES ISSUES RELATED TO

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FOR SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS EITHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE OR

HELD-TO-MATURITY UNDER SFAS 115 (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL FUNDS)

AND FOR INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD. A PROPOSED FSP ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WAS

ISSUED BY THE FASB AND IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN 2005. THE IMPACT OF EITF 03-1, IF ANY, TO THE

FIRMS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE FINAL CONSENSUS IS ISSUED.

ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST RATE LOCK COMMITMENTS (IRLCS)

IRLCS ASSOCIATED WITH MORTGAGES TO BE HELD FOR SALE REPRESENT COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AT

SPECIFIED INTEREST RATES. ON MARCH 9, 2004, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED SAB NO.

105, WHICH SUMMARIZES THE VIEWS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION STAFF REGARDING THE

APPLICATION OF U.S. GAAP TO LOAN COMMITMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. SAB 105

STATES THAT THE VALUE OF THE SERVICING ASSET SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

OF IRLCS. SAB 105 IS APPLICABLE FOR ALL IRLCS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES AND ENTERED INTO ON OR

AFTER APRIL 1, 2004.

PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDED IRLCS AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

IRLCS INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF THE LOAN SERVICING RIGHT INHERENT IN THE UNDERLYING

LOAN, NET OF THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO CLOSE THE LOAN. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, AND AS A RESULT OF SAB

105, THE FIRM NO LONGER ASSIGNS FAIR VALUE TO IRLCS ON THE DATE THEY ARE ENTERED INTO, WITH ANY

INITIAL GAIN BEING RECOGNIZED UPON THE SALE OF THE RESULTANT LOAN. ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH SAB 105,

THE FIRM RECORDS ANY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE IRLCS, EXCLUDING THE SERVICING ASSET COMPONENT,

DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AFTER THEY ARE LOCKED. ADOPTING SAB 105 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE FIRMS 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN LOANS OR DEBT SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE AICPA ISSUED SOP 03-3, WHICH REQUIRES THAT LOANS PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT

DUE TO POOR CREDIT QUALITY BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF A LOSS

ACCRUAL OR VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. SOP 03-3 ALSO LIMITS THE YIELD THAT MAY BE

ACCRETED TO THE EXCESS OF THE UNDISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE INITIAL INVESTMENT IN THE

LOAN. SUBSEQUENT INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY THROUGH AN

ADJUSTMENT OF YIELD OVER ITS REMAINING LIFE AND DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED AS

AN IMPAIRMENT. FOR JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITIES, SOP 03-3 BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR LOANS OR DEBT SECURITIES

ACQUIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2004.

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(THE ACT) WAS ENACTED. IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP SFAS 106-2, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGE 92-95 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN EARLY 2005, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW TO APPLY CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE ACT, WHICH MAY LEAD TO FUTURE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS, HOWEVER,

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

ACCOUNTING FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A REVISION TO FIN 46 TO ADDRESS VARIOUS TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS

AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT HAD ARISEN SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF FIN 46. EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2004,

JPMORGAN CHASE IMPLEMENTED FIN 46R FOR ALL VIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MADE BY ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS. IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE APPLICATION OF FIN 46R INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AND INTERPRETATIONS BY MANAGEMENT. THE

FIRM IS AWARE OF DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS BEING DEVELOPED AMONG ACCOUNTING PROFESSIONALS AND THE

EITF WITH REGARD TO ANALYZING DERIVATIVES UNDER FIN 46R. MANAGEMENTS CURRENT INTERPRETATION IS

THAT DERIVATIVES SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY FOCUSING ON AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE RIGHTS AND

OBLIGATIONS OF A VIES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, EQUITY, AND OTHER CONTRACTS, WHILE CONSIDERING: THE

ENTITYS ACTIVITIES AND DESIGN; THE TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT AND THE ROLE IT HAS WITH

ENTITY; AND WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT CREATES AND/OR ABSORBS VARIABILITY OF THE VIE. THE FIRM

WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPING INTERPRETATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) OR 15D-15(F) UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE, PRINCIPAL OPERATING AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BOARD

OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE

FRAMEWORK IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE COSO CRITERIA.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, JPMORGAN

CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA.

ADDITIONALLY, BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, JPMORGAN CHASES

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHO ALSO AUDITED THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE

&

CO..

WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INTEGRATED AUDIT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND AUDITS

OF ITS 2003 AND 2002 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE

PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE

COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL

 INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN

THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE

FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH

OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES. THE FIRM IS A

LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES

FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION

PROCESSING, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, PRIVATE BANKING

AND PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES

126-127 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP) AND

PREVAILING INDUSTRY PRACTICES. ADDITIONALLY, WHERE

APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY BANK

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE

ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING

INTERESTS OF AN ENTITY. HOWEVER, A CONTROLLING

FINANCIAL INTEREST MAY ALSO EXIST IN ENTITIES,

SUCH AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES),

THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE

CONTROLLING VOTING INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL

MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS

AND RISKS. THEY ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CRITICAL TO THE

FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY

BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR

CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY SET UP FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING

ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A

COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS

THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES

TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE

ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS.

SPES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE,

THEREBY INSULATING INVESTORS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE

CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER

OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS

APPLICABLE TO SPES; THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE)

FRAMEWORK UNDER SFAS 140; AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46R. THE

APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY. THE

QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY

TRANSFERS (SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE

MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA AS DEFINED IN SFAS 140.

THESE CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY

PREDETERMINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY AT THE INCEPTION OF

THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE

FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THE

ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. ENTITIES MEETING

THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BY THE

TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTY, AS LONG AS THE

ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO

LIQUIDATE OR TO CAUSE IT TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE

CRITERIA. THE FIRM PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE

QSPE MODEL FOR SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD LOANS AND

AUTOMOBILE LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 13

ON PAGES 103-106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN THE SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA,

CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46R.

UNDER FIN 46R, A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT.

(1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO

PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM

OTHER PARTIES, (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE

RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE

ENTITYS OPERATIONS, AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS

THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB OR THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE ENTITYS LOSSES OR RETURNS.

FIN 46R REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E.,

A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF

THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED

LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE

RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS PARTY IS

CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE ENTITY.

THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE FIRM MEETS THE

CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

OF A VIE REQUIRES AN EVALUATION OF ALL TRANSACTIONS

(SUCH AS INVESTMENTS, LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES AND FEE ARRANGEMENTS) WITH THE ENTITY

AND AN EXPECTED LOSS CALCULATION WHEN NECESSARY.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES 106-109

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIOR TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF FIN 46 ON JULY 1,

2003, THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO CONSOLIDATE

DEPENDED ON THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

FOR NON-QSPES, INCLUDING A DETERMINATION REGARDING

THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT MADE BY THIRD

PARTIES IN THE SPE. CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WHETHER A THIRD PARTY HAD MADE

A SUBSTANTIVE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE SPE; WHICH

PARTY HAD VOTING RIGHTS, IF ANY; WHO MADE DECISIONS

ABOUT THE ASSETS IN THE SPE; AND WHO WAS AT RISK OF

LOSS. THE SPE WAS CONSOLIDATED IF JPMORGAN CHASE

RETAINED OR ACQUIRED CONTROL OVER THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE DERECOGNIZED WHEN THEY MEET

THE ACCOUNTING SALE CRITERIA. THOSE CRITERIA ARE.

ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE NET ASSETS

OF BANK ONE  BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES

NOTE 6  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

NEW U.S.-BASED POSTRETIREMENT PLANS WERE

APPROVED IN 2004 AND THE PRIOR PLANS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND BANK ONE WERE MERGED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004.

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 87 AND

SFAS 88. ITS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE

INSURANCE PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 106.

THE FIRM USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31 FOR

ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS. THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS IS

USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS FOR ITS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS. FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN, THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE, WHICH RECOGNIZES

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, IS

USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS. UNRECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL GAINS

AND LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING

SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS, IF

REQUIRED.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

ACT) WAS ENACTED. THE ACT ESTABLISHED A

PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE (MEDICARE

PART D) AND A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A

BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO

MEDICARE PART D. THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT

BENEFITS PROVIDED TO CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS WILL BE

AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D

AND HAS REFLECTED THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE

SUBSIDY IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

RETROACTIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF 2004 (JULY 1, 2004

FOR BANK ONE PLANS) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FSP SFAS

106-2.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN

EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, IN THE FORM OF

SALARY AND INTEREST CREDITS, TO DETERMINE THE

BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE.

EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER

COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS VEST

AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS

BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO

QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS

BASED ON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF

SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND ITS PENSION PLANS

IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX

LAWS. IN 2004, THE FIRM MADE A CASH CONTRIBUTION TO

ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN OF $1.1

BILLION ON APRIL 1, FUNDING THE PLAN TO THE MAXIMUM

ALLOWABLE AMOUNT UNDER APPLICABLE TAX LAW.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MADE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS

TOTALING $40 MILLION TO FULLY FUND THE ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

BASED ON THE CURRENT FUNDED STATUS OF THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO

MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2005.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY

WITH LENGTH OF SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND

PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED

MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE

CONTRIBUTORY, WHILE THE LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFITS ARE ALSO OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K.

EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION IS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH

CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI) PURCHASED

ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES.

WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI

PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE

FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM

PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE

U.K. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE FUNDED STATUS AND

AMOUNTS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE

COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS REPORTED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS (I.E., U.S. PLANS NOT SUBJECT

TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

SECURITY ACT). THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS

IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN SERVICE CREDITS ON

COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED

BY LAW. THIS PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED,

NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION PLAN WITH AN UNFUNDED

LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, IN THE

AMOUNT OF $292 MILLION AND $178 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

FIRMS OTHER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TOTALED

$28 MILLION IN 2004, $19 MILLION IN 2003 AND $15

MILLION IN 2002.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

FOR U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN

ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF ITS INVESTMENT

ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE)

RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY

THE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION. ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE

DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK

APPROACH AND ARE NOT BASED STRICTLY ON HISTORICAL

RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS

THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH

AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS

ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION,

REAL BOND YIELDS AND RISK SPREADS (AS APPROPRIATE),

ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM

CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE

DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND

BOND MARKETS.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH REPRESENTS THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS,

PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES

ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO

CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE

SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN

AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH

ASSET CLASS, SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON

LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND AA-RATED

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS, PLUS AN EQUITY RISK

PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS IS SELECTED

BY REFERENCE TO THE YEAR-END MOODYS CORPORATE AA

RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER HIGH-QUALITY INDICES WITH

SIMILAR DURATION TO THAT OF THE RESPECTIVE PLANS

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO

THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS BOND

RATE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE FIRM REDUCED THE

DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE ITS U.S. BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS TO 5.75%. THE FIRM ALSO REDUCED THE

2005 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ITS U.S.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS TO 7.50%. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE FIRMS COLI

POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT 7%; HOWEVER,

WITH THE MERGER OF BANK ONES OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLAN ASSETS, THE FIRMS OVERALL EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS

DECREASED TO 6.80% TO REFLECT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE

EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR THE MERGED PLAN. THE

CHANGES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, TO THE DISCOUNT

RATE AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE 2005 U.S.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES

BY APPROXIMATELY $41 MILLION. THE IMPACT OF ANY

CHANGES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ON NON-U.S.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES

IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES ARE MOST SENSITIVE

TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A

25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN

AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION IN 2005

U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT

IN AN INCREASE IN 2005 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$16 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $215

MILLION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE

RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE

RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY

MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR AND ISSUER.

SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX

FOR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING

VARIOUS RISK FACTORS AND EACH PLANS INVESTMENT

RETURN OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S.

QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION, IN

RECOGNITION OF ITS LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND, ON A QUARTERLY

BASIS, ARE REBALANCED TO TARGET, TO THE EXTENT

ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL.

THE FIRMS U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN

VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE INVESTED IN WELL DIVERSIFIED

PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY (INCLUDING U.S. LARGE AND

SMALL CAPITALIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES),

FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING CORPORATE AND

GOVERNMENT

BONDS), TREASURY INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD

SECURITIES, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OTHER SECURITIES.

NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE SIMILARLY INVESTED

IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED

INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRMS

COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND PARTIALLY THE

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN, ARE HELD IN

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE

INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS. IN

ADDITION, TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL DEBT SECURITIES,

HELD IN A TRUST, ARE USED TO FUND THE U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN. ASSETS USED TO FUND

THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS INCLUDE $53 MILLION OF JPMORGAN CHASE

COMMON STOCK IN ADDITION TO JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON

STOCK HELD IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN

THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

PLANS IN THE U.S. AND IN CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE IS THE

JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, COVERING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN ALLOWS

EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS TO

TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM

MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A

CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND

LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A SPECIFIED SERVICE

REQUIREMENT AND ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED IN SUCH

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. THE FIRMS DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE PLANS TOTALED

$317 MILLION IN 2004, $240 MILLION IN 2003 AND $251

MILLION IN 2002.

NOTE 7  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE

ADOPTED SFAS 123 USING THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION

METHOD. SFAS 123 REQUIRES ALL STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS AND

STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS),

TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. STOCK OPTIONS

THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002

CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25 USING THE

INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, NO

EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS OR SARS

GRANTED AT THE STOCK PRICE ON GRANT DATE, SINCE

SUCH OPTIONS HAVE NO INTRINSIC VALUE. THE FIRM

CURRENTLY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL TO

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) IS MEASURED BASED

ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND THE STOCK PRICE

AT THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE REQUIRED SERVICE

PERIOD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, JPMORGAN CHASE

CONVERTED ALL OUTSTANDING BANK ONE EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT THE MERGER DATE, AND THOSE

AWARDS BECAME EXERCISABLE FOR OR BASED UPON

JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF AWARDS

CONVERTED, AND THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THOSE AWARDS,

WAS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MERGER

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 123R,

WHICH REVISES SFAS 123 AND SUPERSEDES APB 25.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING UNDER SFAS 123R IS

GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THE SFAS 123 APPROACH EXCEPT

THAT SFAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND

SARS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT

BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. SFAS 123R MUST BE

ADOPTED NO LATER THAN JULY 1, 2005. SFAS 123R

PERMITS ADOPTION USING ONE OF TWO METHODS 

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE. THE

FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING BOTH THE TIMING AND

METHOD OF ADOPTING THE NEW STANDARD.

KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED

INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER TWO

PLANS (THE LTI PLANS): THE 1996 LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1996 PLAN), AS AMENDED AND

APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN MAY 2000, PROVIDES FOR

GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, SARS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RSU AWARDS, AND THE STOCK OPTION PLAN, A

NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN, PROVIDES FOR GRANTS

OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS. IN 2004, 14.5 MILLION

SARS

SETTLED ONLY IN SHARES AND 2.2 MILLION NONQUALIFIED

STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE 1996 PLAN.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS ARE

GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO JPMORGAN

CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE.

GENERALLY, OPTIONS AND SARS CANNOT BE EXERCISED

UNTIL AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND

BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS AS

DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT. THESE AWARDS

GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

(B)

LAPSED AWARDS REPRESENT BOTH RESTRICTED STOCK

FOR WHICH RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED AND RSUS THAT

HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS ARE GRANTED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER THE 1996 PLAN AT NO COST TO

THE RECIPIENT. THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO

FORFEITURE UNTIL CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED,

INCLUDING CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR A SPECIFIED

PERIOD. THE RECIPIENT OF A SHARE OF RESTRICTED

STOCK IS ENTITLED TO VOTING RIGHTS AND DIVIDENDS

ON THE COMMON STOCK. AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT

TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AFTER THE

APPLICABLE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE; THE

RECIPIENT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS

EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING

COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS

OUTSTANDING.

THE VESTING OF CERTAIN AWARDS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2002

IS CONDITIONED UPON CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

BEING MET AND JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK

REACHING AND SUSTAINING TARGET PRICES WITHIN A

FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DURING 2002, IT WAS

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE

TARGET STOCK PRICES RELATED TO FORFEITABLE AWARDS

GRANTED IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001 WOULD BE ACHIEVED

WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND

ACCORDINGLY, PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES WERE

REVERSED. THE TARGET STOCK PRICES FOR THESE AWARDS

RANGE FROM $73.33 TO $85.00. FORFEITURES OF THE

1999 AWARDS IN 2004 EQUALED 1.2 MILLION SHARES; AND

1.2 MILLION SHARES OF THE 2000 AWARD WERE FORFEITED

IN JANUARY 2005. THE 2001 AWARDS WILL BE FORFEITED

IN JANUARY 2006 IF THEIR STOCK PRICE TARGETS ARE

NOT ACHIEVED.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN JANUARY 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED A TOTAL OF

6.3 MILLION OPTIONS AND SARS TO ALL ELIGIBLE

FULL-TIME (75 OPTIONS EACH) AND PART-TIME (38

OPTIONS EACH) EMPLOYEES UNDER THE VALUE SHARING

PLAN, A NONSHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN. THE EXERCISE

PRICE IS EQUAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK

PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. THE OPTIONS BECOME

EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS AND GENERALLY

EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

COMPARISON OF THE FAIR AND INTRINSIC VALUE MEASUREMENT METHODS

PRE-TAX EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO THESE PLANS TOTALED $1.3 BILLION IN 2004,

$919 MILLION IN 2003 AND $590 MILLION IN 2002. IN

RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123

ELIMINATED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EXPENSE IMPACT OF

ISSUING OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, THE FIRM

CHANGED ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES UPON THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123 TO PERMIT EMPLOYEES TO ELECT TO

RECEIVE INCENTIVE AWARDS IN THE FORM OF OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. THE $266

MILLION IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123 IN 2003

IS COMPRISED OF (I) $86 MILLION REPRESENTING THE

VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 2003 AND (II)

$180 MILLION REPRESENTING THE VALUE OF RESTRICTED

STOCK GRANTED DURING 2003 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

ISSUABLE SOLELY IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS PRIOR

TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123.

NOTE 9  SECURITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS, HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING SECURITIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES 90-91. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS WHEN, IN MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT, THEY MAY BE SOLD IN RESPONSE TO OR IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, OR AS

PART OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK. AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AFTER SFAS 133 VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS). THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES /PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO

MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT IS EVALUATED CONSIDERING NUMEROUS FACTORS, AND THEIR RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE VARIES

CASE TO CASE. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE

HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER; AND THE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET

VALUE. IF, BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE

SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS.

INCLUDED IN THE $989 MILLION OF GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS

$457 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE

SECURITIES ARE PREDOMINATELY RATED AAA AND THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DUE TO OVERALL INCREASES IN

MARKET INTEREST RATES AND NOT DUE TO UNDERLYING CREDIT CONCERNS OF THE ISSUERS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES AGED GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS HAVE A MARKET VALUE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THAT IS WITHIN 3% OF THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ALL AGED UNREALIZED LOSSES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED

WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME THROUGH A TYPICAL INTEREST RATE CYCLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED

THAT NONE OF THE SECURITIES IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN CALCULATING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) AND COLLATERALIZED

MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMO), JPMORGAN CHASE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENTS.

MANAGEMENT REGULARLY PERFORMS SIMULATION TESTING TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT MARKET CONDITIONS

WOULD HAVE ON ITS MBS AND CMO PORTFOLIOS. MBSS AND CMOS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES HAVE PREPAYMENT

RISK ARE INCLUDED IN THE AFS PORTFOLIO AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AMORTIZED COST, ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND AVERAGE YIELD AT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY HELD BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

(WHICH INCLUDES JPMORGAN PARTNERS, REPORTED AS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS SEGMENT PRIOR TO THE MERGER,

AND BANK ONES ONE EQUITY PARTNERS). THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS INVESTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY

AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE

OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

AT FAIR VALUE. REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN VALUE ARE REPORTED

IN SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE

GAINS OR LOSSES OCCUR.

PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED BASED ON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS

ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS

WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY PRIVATE EQUITYS SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE

REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE

AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, COMPARABLE INDUSTRY VALUATIONS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN MARKET

OUTLOOK AND CHANGES IN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN

THE FINANCE AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE

INVESTMENTS HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY.

PRIVATE EQUITY ALSO HOLDS PUBLICLY-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED THROUGH THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MARKED TO MARKET AT THE QUOTED

PUBLIC VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY INCORPORATES

THE USE OF DISCOUNTS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT

IMMEDIATELY REALIZE OR RISK MANAGE THE

QUOTED PUBLIC VALUES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY, CORPORATE AND/OR CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED ON THESE HOLDINGS.

NOTE 10  SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY

POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS. THE

FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL

BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. WHERE APPROPRIATE, RESALE AND

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN

41. JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY

BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM ITS

COUNTERPARTIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND

REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES WHEN NECESSARY.

TRANSACTIONS SIMILAR TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER THAN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE) OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A

FORWARD OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A

DERIVATIVE, IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS PURCHASES

UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND $15 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES UNDER SFAS 140 WERE $20

BILLION AND $8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND DECEMBER 31, 2003, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE

SHORT-TERM DURATION OF THESE CONTRACTS, THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IS INSIGNIFICANT.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR

RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE

MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR

INTEREST EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 11  LOANS

LOANS ARE REPORTED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES. LOANS HELD FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS

TRADING WHERE POSITIONS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD TO MAKE PROFITS FROM SHORT-TERM MOVEMENTS IN PRICE.

LOANS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH

THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN TRADING REVENUE. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST

METHOD, OR ON A BASIS APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED. LOANS (OTHER THAN

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS

REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS

SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN

CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL

CASH THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOAN. LOANS ARE RESTORED TO

ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS

ARE REASONABLY ASSURED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED

STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(FFIEC) POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH

THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING

OF BANKRUPTCY, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF (TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE IF COLLATERALIZED) AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE. INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT

CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED-OFF OR PAID. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER

LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME WHEN THE CONSUMER LOAN IS CHARGED OFF. A

COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURE AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS

ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER ASSETS, ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL

POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL. THIS IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE

TAKEN PLACE.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTE 12  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (PRIMARILY RISK-RATED) AND

CONSUMER (PRIMARILY SCORED) LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOANS.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, MANAGEMENT MODIFIED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE COMBINED FIRM. THE EFFECT OF CONFORMING METHODOLOGIES IN 2004 WAS A DECREASE

IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE OF $254 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE (INCLUDING BOTH

FUNDED LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS) OF $330 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE BANK ONE SELLERS

INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS WAS DECERTIFICATED; THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO THE

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION (PRE-TAX) IN 2004.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS: ASSET-SPECIFIC LOSS AND FORMULA-BASED

LOSS. WITHIN THE FORMULA-BASED LOSS IS A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT RELATES TO PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND

MEASURED PURSUANT TO SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR

COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF THE LOAN ARE LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT

LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC LOSS COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE

EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS.

THE FORMULA-BASED LOSS COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS AND IS THE PRODUCT

OF A STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AS WELL AS ADJUSTMENTS TO SUCH CALCULATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TAKE

INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE

OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. FOR

RISK-RATED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS), THESE FACTORS ARE

DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND MATURITY. FOR SCORED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE

CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS), LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND

OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION

FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED RANGES USING HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED

AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION WHERE RELEVANT. ADJUSTMENTS

TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING

THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT. MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED

ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A

METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES

AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND

THE DEPUTY CHIEF RISK OFFICER OF THE FIRM AND IS DISCUSSED WITH A RISK

SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E.,

SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET

IDENTIFIABLE).

NOTE 13  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES, SELLS AND SERVICES VARIOUS CONSUMER LOANS, SUCH AS CONSUMER REAL

ESTATE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN WHOLESALE LOANS (PRIMARILY REAL

ESTATE) ORIGINATED BY THE INVESTMENT BANK. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTMENT BANK PURCHASES, PACKAGES AND

SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOANS. ALL IB ACTIVITY IS COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS WHOLESALE

ACTIVITIES BELOW. INTERESTS IN THE SOLD AND SECURITIZED LOANS MAY BE RETAINED AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE TRANSFERRED LOANS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED

FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS AND THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED

ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED

BETWEEN THE LOANS SOLD AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS, BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE

OF SALE. SINCE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM USUALLY ESTIMATES THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS USING MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY

VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR

THE RISKS INVOLVED. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. RETAINED

INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK, SUCH THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY NOT RECOVER

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE; SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE

REFLECTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN EARNINGS, IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RETAINED INTEREST

HAS DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND SUCH DECLINE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE

SPES ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 88 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT

REFLECTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED

BELOW) BUT ARE INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE QSPE PURCHASING THE ASSETS. ASSETS HELD BY

SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS, REPRESENTING THE FIRMS INTERESTS

REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST

SALES RESULTED IN PRE-TAX GAINS OF $58.1 MILLION

AND $564.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE FIRM HAD,

WITH RESPECT TO ITS CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUSTS,

$35.2 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATED TO ITS UNDIVIDED INTEREST, AND $2.1 BILLION

AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ITS

SUBORDINATED INTEREST IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES

ON THE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES, NET OF AN ALLOWANCE

FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN

A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF 4% TO 7% OF THE

PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS. THE FIRM

MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN ITS

PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS OF

APPROXIMATELY 23% AND 17% FOR 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO

PREDETERMINED LIMITS FOR SOME OF ITS CREDIT CARD

AND AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, IN THE UNLIKELY

EVENT OF DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS OWED TO

INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN SUCH ESCROW

ACCOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, AMOUNTED TO $395 MILLION AND

$132 MILLION FOR CREDIT CARD AND

AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY; AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THESE AMOUNTS WERE $456 MILLION

AND $137 MILLION FOR CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE

SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 14  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE 88 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN

CHASES POLICIES REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES

OCCURS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANK: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST

CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A

COST-EFFICIENT MANNER, BY PROVIDING THE STRUCTURAL

FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THEIR NEEDS PERTAINING TO

PRICE, YIELD AND DESIRED RISK. THERE ARE TWO BROAD

CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES IN THE

IB: (1) MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND (2) CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION; BOTH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE IB

ALSO SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH QSPES WHICH ARE NOT

CONSIDERED VIES, TO CREATE ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 ON

PAGES 103106 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT: PROVIDES INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE

FIRMS MUTUAL FUNDS DEEMED VIES. AWM EARNS A FIXED

FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH

EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS

COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, THE FIRMS INTEREST IS

NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT UNDER FIN 46R.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES

TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF

VIES. THESE SERVICES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED

TO NON-VIES.

TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR SERVICES

PROVIDED. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



COMMERCIAL BANKING: UTILIZES VIES AS PART OF ITS MIDDLE MARKETS BUSINESS.

THIS INVOLVEMENT INCLUDES: (1) STRUCTURING AND

ADMINISTERING INDEPENDENT, MEMBER-OWNED FINANCE

ENTITIES FOR COMPANIES WITH DEDICATED

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WHERE THE FIRM MAY

ALSO PROVIDE SOME LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT

AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; AND (2) SYNTHETIC

LEASE TRANSACTIONS, IN WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDES

FINANCING TO A SPE; IN TURN, THE SPE PURCHASES

ASSETS, WHICH ARE THEN LEASED BY THE SPE TO THE

FIRMS CUSTOMER. THE CB EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES

FOR PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES. THESE ACTIVITIES DO

NOT INVOLVE THE FIRM HOLDING A SIGNIFICANT

INTEREST IN VIES.



THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, NOW INCLUDED

IN CORPORATE, IS INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT MAY BE

DEEMED VIES. PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY AUDIT GUIDE (AUDIT GUIDE). THE FASB

DEFERRED ADOPTION OF FIN 46R FOR NON-REGISTERED

INVESTMENT COMPANIES THAT APPLY THE AUDIT GUIDE

UNTIL THE PROPOSED STATEMENT OF POSITION ON THE

CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT GUIDE IS

FINALIZED. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO APPLY THIS

DEFERRAL PROVISION; HAD FIN

46R BEEN APPLIED TO VIES SUBJECT TO THIS DEFERRAL,

THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT

ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES WITH WHICH THE IB IS

INVOLVED: MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT

INTERMEDIATION. THESE ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY

BELOW.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, WHERE IT HELPS

MEET CUSTOMERS FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS

TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN

AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THESE ENTITIES ARE

SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE CORPORATIONS IN THE

BUSINESS OF PURCHASING INTERESTS IN, AND MAKING

LOANS SECURED BY, RECEIVABLE POOLS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS. THE ENTITIES FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND

LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY-RATED

COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT

OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE

POOLS OF ASSETS.

106

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE SERVES AS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND

PROVIDES CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AND LIMITED

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR SEVERAL MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE

CONDUITS IS BACKED BY SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL, CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY

TO SUPPORT RECEIVING AT LEAST A LIQUIDITY RATING OF

A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, F1.

AS A MEANS OF ENSURING TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE

CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY

FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

AN ASSET POOL IS REMOVED FROM THE CONDUIT, THE

ADMINISTRATOR CAN DRAW ON THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY TO

REPAY THE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED

SUCH THAT THE BANK LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED BY

PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL OF

NON-DEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS. DEAL-SPECIFIC

LIQUIDITY IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY

SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS.

PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF REVOLVING

AND SHORT-TERM LENDING COMMITMENTS IS PROVIDED BY

THE FIRM TO THESE VEHICLES IN THE EVENT OF

SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET.

DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE CONDUITS IS

GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF

HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS

AND IS PRIMARILY PROVIDED BY CUSTOMERS (I.E.,

SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF

OVER-COLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER BUT

MAY ALSO INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING.

RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH

COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS

SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE

FIRM PROVIDES LIMITED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE

FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT.

$42.2 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY,

PLUS CONTRACTUAL BUT UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS OF $22.9 BILLION AND $7.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND LIQUIDITY TO THESE MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IS NOT ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE ABSORBED BY THIRD-PARTY

LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS.

(B)

HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

(C)

IN DECEMBER 2003 AND FEBRUARY 2004, TWO MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WERE RESTRUCTURED, WITH EACH

CONDUIT ISSUING PREFERRED SECURITIES ACQUIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY INVESTOR; THE INVESTOR

ABSORBS THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE CONDUIT. IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

OF THE RESTRUCTURED CONDUITS, THE FIRM LEVERAGED AN EXISTING RATING AGENCY MODEL  AN INDEPENDENT

MARKET STANDARD  TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES, AND CONSIDERED THE RELATIVE RIGHTS

AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS.

THE FIRM VIEWS ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AS LIMITED. THIS

IS BECAUSE, FOR THE MOST PART, THE FIRM IS NOT

REQUIRED TO FUND UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IF

THE ASSETS IN THE VIE ARE IN DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY,

THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

ARE SECONDARY TO THE RISK OF FIRST LOSS PROVIDED BY

THE CUSTOMER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES  FOR EXAMPLE,

BY THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF THE VIE WITH THE

ASSETS SOLD TO IT OR NOTES SUBORDINATED TO THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH A

STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLE (SIV) THAT FUNDS A

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGHLY RATED ASSETS BY

ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND

CAPITAL. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THIS SIV

WERE APPROXIMATELY $7.1 BILLION AND ARE INCLUDED IN

THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER

31, 2004.

CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED

IN STRUCTURING VIE TRANSACTIONS TO MEET INVESTOR

AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES VARIOUS

TYPES OF RISKS (INCLUDING FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND

CREDIT), TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS

FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT

TO THE VIES TO FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION. THE

FIRMS CURRENT EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IS

REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR IN

THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

RISKS

INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT,

MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

EXPOSED. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES PRINCIPALLY WITH

THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF VIES: STRUCTURED WHOLESALE

LOAN VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES,

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES AND OTHER

CLIENT-INTERMEDIATION VEHICLES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

FOLLOWING THIS DISCUSSION IS A TABLE SUMMARIZING

THE TOTAL ASSETS HELD BY THESE VEHICLES AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND 2003.

THE FIRM HAS CREATED STRUCTURED WHOLESALE LOAN

VEHICLES MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES, IN WHICH LOANS

ARE PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR THROUGH THE

FIRMS SYNDICATION AND TRADING FUNCTIONS AND FUNDED

BY ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE AMOUNT OF THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THESE VEHICLES TOTALED

$3.4 BILLION AND $5.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTORS PROVIDE

COLLATERAL AND HAVE A FIRST RISK OF LOSS UP TO THE

AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED. THE FIRM RETAINS A

SECOND-RISK-OF-LOSS POSITION AND DOES NOT ABSORB A

MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VEHICLES.

DOCUMENTATION INCLUDES PROVISIONS INTENDED, SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO ENABLE JPMORGAN CHASE TO

TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR

LOAN VEHICLE IF THE VALUE OF THE RELEVANT PORTFOLIO

DECLINES BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. THE FIRM ALSO

PROVIDES LIQUIDITY SUPPORT TO THESE VIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM STRUCTURES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES IN

WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY-RATED ASSETS (SUCH

AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES) AND ENTERS INTO A

CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN

EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT NOT HELD BY THE

VIE. CREDIT-LINKED NOTES ARE ISSUED BY THE VIE TO

TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE

INVESTORS IN THE VIE. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN

PREFER A VIE STRUCTURE, SINCE THE CREDIT-LINKED

NOTES GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN

THEY WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A SERIES OF SECONDARY

MARKET TRUSTS THAT ALLOW TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS TO

FINANCE THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT

RATES. THE VIE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE, LONGER-TERM

HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS BY ISSUING PUTTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND INVERSE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES; THE INVESTORS IN THE

INVERSE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE EXPOSED TO

THE RESIDUAL LOSSES OF THE VIE (THE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS). FOR VEHICLES IN WHICH THE FIRM OWNS

THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE

VIE. IN VEHICLES WHERE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN

THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS

LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE UNWIND TRIGGERS

BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD

PARTIES. THE FIRM OFTEN SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT

FOR THE VIE AND PROVIDES LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT THE

REMARKETING.

ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE STRUCTURES, ON

BEHALF OF CLIENTS, OTHER CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

VEHICLES IN WHICH THE FIRM TRANSFERS THE RISKS

AND RETURNS OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE,

TYPICALLY DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, TO CLIENTS

THROUGH DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

ASSETS HELD BY CERTAIN CLIENT INTERMEDIATIONRELATED VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

FIN 46 TRANSITION

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE

IMPLEMENTED FIN 46 FOR VIES CREATED OR MODIFIED

AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS AN

INTEREST. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003, THE FIRM

IMPLEMENTED FIN 46 FOR ALL VIES ORIGINATED PRIOR TO

FEBRUARY 1, 2003, EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

MADE BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION WAS AN INCREMENTAL

INCREASE IN THE FIRMS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $17 BILLION AT JULY 1, 2003. AS A

RESULT OF ITS ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE FIRM ALSO

DECONSOLIDATED CERTAIN VEHICLES, PRIMARILY THE

WHOLLY-OWNED DELAWARE STATUTORY BUSINESS TRUSTS

FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 112113 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UPON ADOPTION OF FIN 46, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES

AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF VIES WERE GENERALLY

MEASURED AT THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH SUCH INTERESTS

WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED HAD FIN 46 BEEN EFFECTIVE

WHEN THE FIRM FIRST MET THE CONDITIONS TO BE

CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE NET AMOUNT ADDED TO THE BALANCE SHEET

AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED

INTEREST IN THE NEWLY CONSOLIDATED ENTITY WAS

RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING

CHANGE AT JULY 1, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A $2

MILLION (AFTER-TAX) REDUCTION TO THE FIRMS

CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THE FIRM ALSO RECORDED A $34

MILLION (AFTER-TAX) REDUCTION IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RELATED TO AFS SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVE CASH FLOW HEDGES; THESE WERE RELATED TO

ENTITIES MEASURED AT THE AMOUNT AT WHICH SUCH

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIN 46R TRANSITION

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A REVISION TO FIN 46 (FIN 46R) TO ADDRESS VARIOUS TECHNICAL

CORRECTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT HAD ARISEN SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF FIN 46. EFFECTIVE MARCH

31, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE IMPLEMENTED FIN 46R FOR ALL VIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MADE BY

ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R DID NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE APPLICATION OF FIN 46R INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS BY MANAGEMENT. THE

FIRM IS AWARE OF DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS BEING DEVELOPED AMONG ACCOUNTING PROFESSIONALS AND THE

EITF WITH REGARD TO ANALYZING DERIVATIVES UNDER FIN 46R. MANAGEMENTS CURRENT INTERPRETATION IS

THAT DERIVATIVES SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY FOCUSING ON AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE RIGHTS AND

OBLIGATIONS OF A VIES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, EQUITY AND OTHER CONTRACTS, WHILE CONSIDERING THE

ENTITYS ACTIVITIES AND DESIGN; THE TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT AND THE ROLE IT HAS WITH THE

ENTITY; AND WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT CREATES AND/OR ABSORBS VARIABILITY OF THE VIE. THE FIRM

WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPING INTERPRETATIONS.

NOTE 15  GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 142, RECLASSIFYING CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS

FROM GOODWILL TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS

142.

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT (WHICH IS

GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 31 ON

PAGES 126-127 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT; PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). GOODWILL

IS TESTED ANNUALLY (DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT

LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET

MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE FINITE LIVES,

SUCH AS CORE DEPOSITS AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. IN ADDITION,

IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED PERIODICALLY ON THESE AMORTIZING INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH REPRESENT

THE RIGHT TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE

EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS;

MAKING TAX AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND

EXECUTING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

TO THE INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE AMOUNT CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PAID TO THIRD PARTIES TO ACQUIRE MSRS OR IS

BASED ON FAIR VALUE, IF RETAINED UPON THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS,

DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE

AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES ARE SUPPORTABLE AND REASONABLE.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS MSRS AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 140. MSRS

ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME RECEIVED IN PROPORTION TO, AND OVER THE

PERIOD OF THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SERVICING INCOME STREAM OF, THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS. FOR

PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND MEASURING IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIES ITS PORTFOLIO ON THE

BASIS OF THE PREDOMINANT RISK CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH ARE LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST RATE. ANY

INDICATED IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE THROUGH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRATUM EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM EVALUATES OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY REVIEWING CHANGES IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER

MARKET INTEREST RATES OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS AND THEN DETERMINES AN INTEREST RATE SCENARIO TO

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF THE MSRS GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND THE RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT

COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ANY GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND RELATED

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AMOUNT THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, BASED

UPON THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

109

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES, AFS SECURITIES AND TRADING

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENT. MSRS

DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE

INTEREST PAYMENTS) DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES INCREASE. THE FIRM OFFSETS THE INTEREST

RATE RISK OF ITS MSRS BY DESIGNATING CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (E.G., A COMBINATION OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS

AND FLOORS THAT PRODUCES AN INTEREST RATE PROFILE OPPOSITE TO THE DESIGNATED RISK OF THE HEDGED

MSRS) AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF SPECIFIED MSRS UNDER SFAS 133. SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING ALLOWS THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED MSRS TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE

CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS. BOTH OF THESE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

WHEN APPLYING SFAS 133, THE LOANS UNDERLYING THE MSRS BEING HEDGED ARE STRATIFIED INTO SPECIFIC

SFAS 133 ASSET GROUPINGS THAT POSSESS SIMILAR INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT RISK EXPOSURES. THE

DOCUMENTED HEDGE PERIOD FOR THE FIRM IS DAILY. DAILY ADJUSTMENTS ARE PERFORMED TO INCORPORATE NEW

OR TERMINATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND TO MODIFY THE AMOUNT OF THE CORRESPONDING SIMILAR ASSET

GROUPING THAT IS BEING HEDGED. THE FIRM HAS DESIGNATED CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE

(LIBOR) AS THE HEDGED RISK. IN DESIGNATING THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE

IMPACT THAT THE CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK RATE HAS ON THE PREPAYMENT SPEED ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE FIRM PERFORMS BOTH PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIONS, USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN

VALUE OF THE MSRS, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES, TO THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE

OF THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 26 ON PAGES 118-119 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES (BOTH AFS AND TRADING) ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS. BECAUSE THESE

SECURITIES DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 115, WITH

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON TRADING SECURITIES RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS IN SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, INTEREST INCOME ON THE AFS SECURITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS IN NET INTEREST INCOME, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FINALLY, CERTAIN NON-HEDGE DERIVATIVES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED

BY MANAGEMENT IN SFAS 133 HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS, ARE USED TO MANAGE THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE OF

MSRS AND ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES MSR ACTIVITY AND RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR THE DATES INDICATED. IT

ALSO INCLUDES THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, TO IMMEDIATE 10% AND 20% ADVERSE CHANGES IN EACH OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH

CAUTION. AS THE FIGURES INDICATE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON A 10% AND 20% VARIATION IN

ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE

ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A

CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY

OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT

MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS EXCEEDS ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR ITS APPLICABLE SFAS 140 STRATA. CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ARE THE

RESULT OF THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT OR THE RECOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES, DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE PERIOD. THE CHANGES IN THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE FOR MSRS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2004 AND 2003, THE FIRM RECORDED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF ITS MSRS OF $149

MILLION AND $283 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH PERMANENTLY REDUCED THE GROSS CARRYING VALUE OF THE

MSRS AND THE RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE. THE PERMANENT REDUCTION PRECLUDES SUBSEQUENT REVERSALS.

THIS WRITE-DOWN HAD NO IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM.

ALL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

FOR 2004, ALL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $7.9 BILLION, PRINCIPALLY AS A

RESULT OF THE MERGER. THIS INCREASE IS NET OF AMORTIZATION AND INCLUDES $510 MILLION OF

INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES RELATED TO ASSET MANAGEMENT ADVISORY CONTRACTS. INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE

REMAINDER OF THE FIRMS OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. JPMORGAN CHASE COMPUTES DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET. FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THE FIRM USES THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD COMPUTED OVER THE LESSER OF THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASED FACILITY OR 10

YEARS.

JPMORGAN CHASE CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE UNDER SOP 98-1. ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE, THESE COSTS

ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SOFTWARES EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS 4.50%

AND 4.71% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF ITS

DEBT ISSUES. THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE ASSOCIATED

DEBT. THE MODIFIED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS

OF RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WAS 3.97% AND 2.79% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BOTH LONG-TERM DEBT AND

STRUCTURED NOTES SOLD AS PART OF THE FIRMS TRADING ACTIVITIES. THESE GUARANTEES RANK ON A PARITY

TRUSTS) THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE FIRMS JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES.

AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46, JPMORGAN CHASE DECONSOLIDATED ALL THE ISSUER TRUSTS.

ACCORDINGLY, THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE FIRM TO THE

ISSUER TRUSTS, TOTALING $10.3 BILLION AND $6.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY,

WERE REFLECTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN THE LIABILITIES SECTION UNDER THE

CAPTION JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS INTEREST EXPENSES ON THE CORRESPONDING JUNIOR

WITH-HELD TO COVER INCOME TAXES. THE SHARES WITHHELD AMOUNTED TO 5.7 MILLION, 2.3 MILLION AND

2.9 MILLION FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING 2004, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 19.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER A STOCK REPURCHASE

PROGRAM WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON JULY 20, 2004. THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE

SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING 2003 OR 2002 UNDER THE PRIOR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, APPROXIMATELY 531 MILLION UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE, OPTION AND STOCK-PURCHASE PLANS.

NOTE 20  EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IN THE

INCOME STATEMENT. BASIC EPS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK BY THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED USING

THE SAME METHOD AS BASIC EPS BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES REFLECT, IN

ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING SHARES, THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED INTO COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME

AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED EPS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK WERE

NECESSARY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CALCULATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR 2004, 2003 AND

2002.

NOTE 22  INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET-AND-LIABILITY METHOD REQUIRED BY SFAS 109 TO PROVIDE INCOME

TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS REQUIRES THAT

INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN

CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO

REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT.

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. ALL OTHER PERIODS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECTS OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS

SECURITIES, SFAS 133 HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. THE TAX EFFECT OF THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $190 MILLION AND $898 MILLION IN 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, AND

DECREASED BY $1.1 BILLION IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF THESE TAX EFFECTS.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD

OF TIME. FOR 2004, SUCH EARNINGS APPROXIMATED $369 MILLION ON A PRE-TAX BASIS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $2.6

BILLION. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD RESULT

UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO

LAW. THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN

EARNINGS AT A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY PROVIDING A DIVIDENDS RECEIVED

DEDUCTION ON THE REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION

PROVISION). THE NEW DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND IS

EFFECTIVE FOR EITHER THE 2004 OR 2005 TAX YEARS FOR CALENDAR YEAR TAXPAYERS. THE RANGE OF

POSSIBLE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR REPATRIATION UNDER THIS PROVISION IS BETWEEN ZERO AND

$1.9 BILLION. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND, AT

THIS TIME, CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATED RANGE OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF SUCH REPATRIATION

PROVISION. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT REFLECTED THE TAX EFFECT OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION IN

INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR INCOME TAX LIABILITIES.

THE TAX EXPENSE APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002 WAS

$126 MILLION, $477 MILLION AND $531 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 23  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK

SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION IN 2004 AND $2.6 BILLION IN 2003.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED

LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS

TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH

LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND

INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE FRB, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) AND THE FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY

ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE,

INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE

BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE

IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2005 AND 2004, JPMORGAN CHASES BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, $6.2

BILLION AND $4.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. DIVIDEND CAPACITY IN 2005 WILL BE

SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKS EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.3 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.6 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 24  CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1

CAPITAL INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER

1, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY CAPITAL IS

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES OF THE FRB, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL

(TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE

DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ADJUSTED ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FRB TO TAKE ACTION. BANK SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO

THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS PRIMARY BANKING SUBSIDIARIES MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH

EACH WAS SUBJECT.

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT USED PRIMARILY FOR BANKING PURPOSES.

CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENT ESCALATION CLAUSES FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES; THEY MAY ALSO CONTAIN OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES AND RENEWAL-OPTION CLAUSES CALLING FOR INCREASED RENTS. NO LEASE AGREEMENT

IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ENGAGE IN DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING

LITIGATION RESERVE

DURING 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE INCREASED ITS LITIGATION RESERVE BY $3.7 BILLION. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, THE AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS LITIGATION RESERVE AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, REFLECTED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE LITIGATION RESERVE LEVEL IN LIGHT OF ALL

INFORMATION KNOWN AS OF THAT DATE. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS LITIGATION RESERVES PERIODICALLY, AND THE

RESERVE MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED IN THE FUTURE TO REFLECT FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRM

BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY, LITIGATING OR SETTLING CASES, ACCORDING TO MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AS TO

WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF STOCKHOLDERS.

NOTE 26  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END USERS TO INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR

MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST RATE

PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR

ITS CUSTOMERS AND ALSO IS AN END-USER OF DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS.

SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138 AND SFAS 149, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE USED FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS. ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR

HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE

ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONTRACT IS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES OR HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVES AS AN END USER TO

HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. BOTH TRADING AND END-USER DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES

9091 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. EACH DERIVATIVE MUST BE DESIGNATED AS

A HEDGE, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION

OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK EXPOSURE, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE

ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS EFFECTIVE

AT ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS MUST BE ASSESSED AT LEAST QUARTERLY.

ANY INEFFECTIVENESS MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF HEDGE

RELATIONSHIPS MEETING STRINGENT CRITERIA, SFAS 133S SHORTCUT METHOD PROVIDES FOR AN ASSUMPTION

OF ZERO INEFFECTIVENESS. UNDER THE SHORTCUT METHOD, QUARTERLY EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT IS NOT

REQUIRED, AND THE ENTIRE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVE IS CONSIDERED TO BE

EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS. DUE TO THE STRICT CRITERIA

OF THE SHORTCUT METHOD, THE FIRMS USE OF THIS METHOD IS PRIMARILY LIMITED TO HEDGES OF LONG-TERM

DEBT.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART

OF THE BASIS OF THE ITEM AND IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING CASH

FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED

IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS

AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED OCCUR,

CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY RELATED

DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE

REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENT ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF NET INVESTMENT

HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, LOANS,

AFS SECURITIES AND MSRS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED

TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, CONVERTING FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A

FLOATING RATE. INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, SWAPTIONS AND FORWARDS ARE ALSO USED IN COMBINATION WITH

INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS MSRS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSR

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 109111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALL AMOUNTS HAVE

BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME, MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, AND OTHER INCOME. THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY

GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2004 ON COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS

FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS USED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT

OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON FUTURE EARNINGS. ALL AMOUNTS AFFECTING

EARNINGS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS

TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE

PORTION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS (FORWARD

POINTS) IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC HEDGES. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF

LOANS AND COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS

133. SIMILARLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES USED

AS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

NOTE 27  OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW DOWN THE

COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY

SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT,

THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS

ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN WHOLESALE-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 102103 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

(C)

INCLUDES UNUSED ADVISED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $22.8 BILLION AND $19.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING. IN REGULATORY FILINGS WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, UNUSED ADVISED LINES ARE NOT REPORTABLE.

(D)

INCLUDES CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS OF $31.8 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY; EXCLUDES $31.7 BILLION AND $6.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY, OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUITS CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46R,

AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OF THE CONDUITS ARE REPORTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IT ALSO INCLUDES $7.5 BILLION AND $9.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, OF

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO STRUCTURED WHOLESALE LOAN VEHICLES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS WAS

INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A

GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A

CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED ON: (A) CHANGES IN AN

UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTYS

FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFFBALANCE SHEET

LENDING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45: CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, STANDBY

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, NEWLY ISSUED OR MODIFIED GUARANTEES THAT ARE NOT DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS HAVE

BEEN RECORDED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE AT INCEPTION IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE

NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS

RECORDED THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. AS

CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, IT IS APPLIED TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER

ASSETS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS

LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY

RELATED TO GUARANTEES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$341 MILLION AND $59 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND ONLY WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS COMPLIED WITH

PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS, AND THEY GENERALLY EXPIRE ON FIXED DATES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

ON WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INCLUDES $185 MILLION AND $153 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT. THE MAJORITY OF THE

FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THESE ASSET-PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY USED AS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY TO SPES, PRIMARILY MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 106109 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS CAN BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME BY THE SPES ADMINISTRATOR, WHILE

OTHERS REQUIRE A TRIGGERING EVENT TO OCCUR. TRIGGERING EVENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A

NEED FOR LIQUIDITY, A MARKET VALUE DECLINE OF THE ASSETS OR A DOWNGRADE IN THE RATING OF JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT

ABOVE THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE

ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF THE

SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON THESE AGREEMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31,

2004.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN

ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS AND

SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE FIRM

TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE GUARANTEES; IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THESE GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM HELD COLLATERAL RELATING TO $7.4 BILLION AND $7.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003, INCLUDED $292 MILLION AND $165 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO STANDBY LETTERS OF

CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HOLDS CUSTOMERS SECURITIES UNDER CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS. AT TIMES, THESE SECURITIES ARE

LOANED TO THIRD PARTIES, AND THE FIRM ISSUES SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO THE

CUSTOMER THAT PROTECT THE CUSTOMER AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSS IF THE THIRD PARTY FAILS TO RETURN THE

SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS FROM THE THIRD PARTY CASH

OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE LOANED

SECURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE FIRM HELD $221.6 BILLION AND $146.7 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN COLLATERAL IN SUPPORT OF THESE AGREEMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF

A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT MAY

ALSO INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR

VALUE; THUS, SUCH A CLAUSE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TERMINATION CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A

THIRD PARTY, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES THAT THIRD PARTY FOR LOSSES IT MAY INCUR DUE TO

ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE. SEE BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS

LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE

INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW

AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13 ON PAGES 103106 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT CERTAIN SECURITIZED LOANS

MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE

PURCHASER OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.

GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER SUCH

REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD BY

SUCH SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED

AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSES. THE POTENTIAL LOSS DUE TO SUCH REPURCHASE

AND/OR INDEMNITY IS MITIGATED BY THE DUE DILIGENCE THE FIRM PERFORMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ASSETS

COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. HISTORICALLY, LOSSES

INCURRED ON SUCH REPURCHASES AND/OR INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT, AND THEREFORE

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN CONNECTION WITH CARD SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN

ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES IN TWO SEPARATE VENTURES, CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND PAYMENTECH (THE

VENTURES), THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. THESE VENTURES PROVIDE

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE VENTURES ARE EACH INDIVIDUALLY

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE FOR PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN

THE CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS FAVOR, THE VENTURES

WILL CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT.

IF THE VENTURES ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, THE

VENTURES WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARD-MEMBER. THE VENTURES

MITIGATE THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING SETTLEMENT, OR BY OBTAINING ESCROW DEPOSITS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT

FROM CERTAIN MERCHANTS. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: 1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS

UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; 2) THE VENTURES DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL

FROM THE MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND 3) THE VENTURES DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, THE FIRM WOULD BE LIABLE TO REFUND THE CARDHOLDER

IN PROPORTION TO ITS APPROXIMATE EQUITY INTEREST IN THE VENTURES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE VENTURES INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $7.1 MILLION ON $396 BILLION OF AGGREGATE

VOLUME PROCESSED, OF WHICH THE FIRM SHARED LIABILITY ONLY ON $205 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME

PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE VENTURES HELD $620 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. IN 2003, THE CHASE

MERCHANT SERVICES VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $2.0 MILLION ON $260 BILLION OF

AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, OF WHICH THE FIRM SHARED LIABILITY ONLY ON $77 BILLION OF AGGREGATE

VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES VENTURE HELD $242 MILLION OF

COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE

VENTURES, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE WOULD NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CREDIT LOSS

ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE VENTURES; THEREFORE, THE FIRM HAS NOT RECORDED ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE VENTURES.

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A

PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER

MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATION VARIES WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. IT MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT

WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS

CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTY FUND, OR, IN A FEW CASES, IT MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE

AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED.

HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS A COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THESE DERIVATIVES

ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT

OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A

SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES THAT EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON A

COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE

FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS $53 BILLION AND $50 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM REDUCES ITS EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING

TRANSACTIONS OR BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS.

THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OF $180 MILLION AND $163

MILLION, AND A DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $622 MILLION AND $333 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH SETTLEMENT

AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR THE BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION TO OWN THE REFERENCE ASSET.

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES AS DESCRIBED IN FIN 45.

NOTE 28  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES

THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT RISK PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE PRIMARILY EVALUATED BY INDUSTRY AND BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN THE

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE PRIMARILY EVALUATED BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC

REGION.

NOTE 29  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY MAY DIFFER BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT AND/OR ITS USE

IN A TRADING OR INVESTING STRATEGY. GENERALLY, THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME;



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND

AS PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME;



AT COST (LESS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS), WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

NOT RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES THERETO;

OR



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR

VALUE IS BASED ON INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENT

INFORMATION AS INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND ARE BASED ON DEFINED

METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

121

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR

PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR

BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. MARKET PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO A AA CREDIT RATING; THUS, ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED

TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. AN ADJUSTMENT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY AND TO ARRIVE AT

FAIR VALUE. WITHOUT THIS ADJUSTMENT, DERIVATIVE POSITIONS WOULD NOT BE

APPROPRIATELY VALUED.



LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE) MARKETS. THUS, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR RISK OF LOSS DUE

TO A LACK OF LIQUIDITY ARE APPLIED TO THOSE POSITIONS TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION

BASED UPON THE LIQUIDITY OR ILLIQUIDITY, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF THE MARKET IN

WHICH THE INSTRUMENT TRADES AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE

FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING

POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE;

AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



CONCENTRATION VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF

UNWINDING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS. THE COST IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR

DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A POSITION DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL. AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD NEEDED TO REDUCE, WITHOUT MARKET DISRUPTION, A POSITION TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL IS GENERALLY BASED ON

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE POSITION TO THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME OF THAT

POSITION. WITHOUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS, LARGER POSITIONS WOULD BE VALUED AT A

PRICE GREATER THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FIRM COULD EXIT THE POSITIONS.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE CONTROLLED BY A PRICE

VERIFICATION GROUP INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION. ECONOMIC SUBSTANTIATION OF MODELS,

PRICES, MARKET INPUTS AND REVENUE THROUGH PRICE/INPUT TESTING, AS WELL AS BACKTESTING, IS DONE TO

VALIDATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A

DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS

107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE

OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS

WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE

DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN

THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN

THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED, BY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

THE FIRM CONSIDERS FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT COST  INCLUDING CASH AND

DUE FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED

INTEREST RECEIVABLE  TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM

NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK.

ASSETS WHERE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS FROM COST

THE FIRMS DEBT, EQUITY AND DERIVATIVE TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE. QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHEN AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING

INSTRUMENTS. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING

PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, OR DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR

PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, CASH FLOWS

ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

SECURITIES

FAIR VALUES OF ACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE SECONDARY MARKET, WHILE THE

FAIR VALUES FOR NONACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE BASED ON INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE FOR DERIVATIVES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING.



POSITION VALUATION, PRINCIPALLY BASED ON LIQUID MARKET PRICING AS EVIDENCED

BY EXCHANGE-TRADED PRICES, BROKER-DEALER QUOTATIONS OR RELATED INPUT

PARAMETERS, WHICH ASSUME ALL COUNTERPARTIES HAVE THE SAME CREDIT RATING;



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESULTING PORTFOLIO VALUATION, TO REFLECT

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES; AND



OTHER FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LIQUIDITY, CONCENTRATION AND OTHER FACTORS.

FOR THOSE DERIVATIVES VALUED BASED ON MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, THE

FIRM DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS

RECOGNIZED IN TRADING REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECOMES

AVAILABLE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DOES NOT INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT

JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES

THE FAIR VALUE OF VARIABLE-RATE INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING AMOUNTS DUE TO THEIR VARIABLE INTEREST TERMS AND NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES FOR FIXED-RATE INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES ARE DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

122

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS

FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS IS DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES SUITABLE FOR EACH TYPE OF LOAN.



FAIR VALUE FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY USING THE

COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCES

IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, ON WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS

BASED, AND LOANS.



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS) AND CONSUMER REAL ESTATE, FOR WHICH MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE

LOANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE, ARE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, ADJUSTED

FOR PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS

ARE CURRENT RATES OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS. FOR CONSUMER REAL ESTATE,

SECONDARY MARKET YIELDS FOR COMPARABLE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

ADJUSTED FOR RISK, ARE USED.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED ON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY

THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, SINCE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ALREADY

REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CREDIT RISK.



THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS IS GENERALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND ON PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. IF

MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK; THAT RISK IS DISCOUNTED, USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

OTHER ASSETS

THIS CAPTION INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MSRS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 9 ON PAGE

100 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR

VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR MSRS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 109-111 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E.,

DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES

NOT ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS

CONSIDERED TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS ARE ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS BASED ON THE

REMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF FUNDS HAVING SIMILAR INTEREST RATES AND SIMILAR MATURITIES.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY

SHORT-TERM IN NATURE; AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR

PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH

FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) ARE GENERALLY

SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST

APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE. THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ALSO INCLUDE BENEFICIAL

INTERESTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS BASED ON CURRENT

MARKET RATES.

LONG-TERM DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST

DEBENTURES HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, IS BASED ON CURRENT

MARKET RATES AND IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

(WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, ON WHICH THE COST

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS) AND LOAN EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED ON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS). THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS CONSUMER

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED ON THE PRIMARY MARKET PRICES TO ORIGINATE NEW COMMITMENTS. IT IS

THE CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES THAT PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

COMMITMENTS.

ON THIS BASIS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS APPROXIMATED THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OF $492 MILLION AND $324

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 30  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INCOME STATEMENT

INFORMATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE BY MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC

AREA. THE FIRM DEFINES INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES AS

BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE CUSTOMERS

RESIDING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE

INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW IS BASED PRIMARILY ON

THE DOMICILE OF THE CUSTOMER. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE

FIRMS U.S. OPERATIONS SERVE INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESSES.

AS THE FIRMS OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED,

ESTIMATES AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE

TO APPORTION REVENUE AND EXPENSE BETWEEN U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLOCATIONS

USED FOR THE FIRMS SEGMENT REPORTING AS SET FORTH

IN NOTE 31 ON PAGES 126-127 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS

PRESENTED ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE

NOTE 31  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT

BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES

AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN

WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF

BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON AN OPERATING BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF OPERATING BASIS, SEE THE

FOOTNOTES TO THE TABLE BELOW. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION CONCERNING JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 28-29 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING WAS REALIGNED TO REFLECT THE NEW

BUSINESS STRUCTURE OF THE COMBINED FIRM. TREASURY WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE INVESTMENT BANK INTO

CORPORATE. THE SEGMENT FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN COMPRISED OF CHASE HOME

FINANCE, CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES, CHASE AUTO FINANCE, CHASE REGIONAL BANKING AND CHASE MIDDLE

MARKET; AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS SEGMENT IS NOW CALLED RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND IS

COMPRISED OF HOME FINANCE, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE, CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING AND

INSURANCE. CHASE MIDDLE MARKET MOVED INTO COMMERCIAL BANKING, AND CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES IS NOW

ITS OWN SEGMENT CALLED CARD SERVICES. TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES REMAINS UNCHANGED. INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING HAS BEEN RENAMED ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT. JPMORGAN PARTNERS, WHICH

FORMERLY WAS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, WAS MOVED INTO CORPORATE. LASTLY,

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS,

MANAGEMENT LOOKS AT RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.

OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. IN THE CASE OF THE INVESTMENT BANK, THE OPERATING BASIS INCLUDES THE

RECLASSIFICATION OF NET INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO TRADING ACTIVITIES TO TRADING REVENUE. IN

THE CASE OF CARD SERVICES, REFER TO FOOTNOTE (F). THESE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT CHANGE JPMORGAN CHASES REPORTED NET INCOME.

FINALLY, OPERATING BASIS EXCLUDES THE MERGER COSTS, THE LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGE AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE ITEMS ARE NOT PART OF THE

FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS (AND, THEREFORE, NOT INDICATIVE OF TRENDS) AND DO NOT

PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PERIODS.

(B)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. ALL OTHER PERIODS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

(C)

INTERSEGMENT REVENUE INCLUDES INTERCOMPANY REVENUE AND REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS,

NET OF INTERSEGMENT EXPENSES. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PRIMARILY

CONDUCTED AT FAIR VALUE.

(D)

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES THE IB MANAGES ON BEHALF OF

CLIENTS THE SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS

REVISED TO BE BASED ON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE EXPOSURES. PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED ON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, PLUS THE ALLOCATED CAPITAL ASSOCIATED WITH

THE SHARED CLIENTS.

(E)

SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE RECLASSIFICATION OF NET INTEREST INCOME (NII)

RELATED TO TRADING ACTIVITIES TO TRADING REVENUE WITHIN NONINTEREST REVENUE, WHICH

PRIMARILY IMPACTS THE INVESTMENT BANK. TRADING-RELATED NII RECLASSIFIED TO TRADING REVENUE WAS $2.0 BILLION, $2.1 BILLION AND

$1.9 BILLION FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED IN

CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT NII AND NONINTEREST REVENUE ON A REPORTED GAAP BASIS FOR JPMORGAN CHASE.

(F)

OPERATING RESULTS FOR CARD SERVICES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON

REVENUE, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AVERAGE ASSETS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD

RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO. THE RELATED SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002 WERE: $5.3 BILLION,

$3.3 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN NII; $(2.4) BILLION, $(1.4) BILLION AND $(1.4) BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN NONINTEREST REVENUE; $2.9 BILLION, $1.9 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES;

AND $51.1 BILLION, $32.4 BILLION AND $26.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN AVERAGE ASSETS. THESE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE ELIMINATED IN CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT THE FIRMS REPORTED GAAP

RESULTS.

(G)

INCLUDES

$858 MILLION OF ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS

CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION RELATED TO THE

DECERTIFICATION OF THE SELLERS RETAINED INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF $584 MILLION RELATED TO CONFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PROVISION METHODOLOGIES FOR THE COMBINED FIRM.

(H)

MERGER COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS: $74

MILLION, INVESTMENT BANK; $201 MILLION, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES; $79 MILLION, CARD

SERVICES; $23 MILLION, COMMERCIAL BANKING; $68 MILLION, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES;

$31 MILLION, ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT; AND $889 MILLION, CORPORATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CORPORATE IS CURRENTLY COMPRISED OF PRIVATE EQUITY (JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND ONE

EQUITY PARTNERS), TREASURY, AS WELL AS CORPORATE SUPPORT AREAS, WHICH INCLUDE CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS, INTERNAL AUDIT, EXECUTIVE OFFICE, FINANCE, GENERAL SERVICES, HUMAN

RESOURCES, MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE

GENERAL COUNSEL, REAL ESTATE AND BUSINESS

SERVICES, RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT.

SEGMENT RESULTS, WHICH ARE

PRESENTED ON AN OPERATING BASIS, REFLECT REVENUES ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS.

THE TAX-EQUIVALENT GROSS-UP FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS BASED UPON THE LEVEL,

TYPE AND TAX JURISDICTION OF THE EARNINGS AND ASSETS WITHIN EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT.

OPERATING REVENUE FOR THE INVESTMENT BANK INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR INCOME TAX CREDITS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS

TAX-EXEMPT

INCOME FROM

MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS. INFORMATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER HAS NOT

BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM WITH THIS NEW PRESENTATION. THE AMOUNT OF

THE TAX-EQUIVALENT GROSS-UP FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ELIMINATED

WITHIN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AND WAS $(303) MILLION,

$(122) MILLION AND $(116) MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE FIRMS SEGMENT RESULTS FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002 ON

AN OPERATING BASIS. THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, MERGER COSTS, LITIGATION CHARGES AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS SO THAT

THE TOTAL FIRM RESULTS ARE ON A REPORTED BASIS. SEGMENT RESULTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO JULY

1, 2004, REFLECT HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE-ONLY RESULTS AND HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT

BUSINESS SEGMENT ORGANIZATION AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS.

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF

10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES MORTGAGED-BACKED SECURITIES (MBSS) AND

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A

CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS FOR MBSS AND CMOS.

(B)

THE AVERAGE YIELD IS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE YEAR. YIELDS ARE

DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF RELATED DERIVATIVES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL

AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(C)

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF STATE AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, CMOS OF PRIVATE ISSUERS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

(D)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, SEE NOTE 9

ON PAGE 98. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND

OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $66,289 MILLION AND $16,663 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HELD-TO-MATURITY

SECURITIES WAS $431 MILLION. THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS AGENCIES

WERE THE ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES EXCEEDED 10%

OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS

(FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN

EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT

REQUIRED UNDER THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FFIEC AND SEC METHODOLOGIES RELATE TO THE TREATMENTS OF LOCAL COUNTRY EXPOSURE AND TO FOREIGN

EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

THIS EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY EXPOSURE ON PAGE 65.
