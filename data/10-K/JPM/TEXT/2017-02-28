OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,

(“JPMORGAN CHASE” OR THE “FIRM”)

A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

(“U.S.”)

, WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE; THE FIRM HAD

$2.5 TRILLION

IN ASSETS AND

$254.2 BILLION

IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016.

THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. UNDER THE J.P. MORGAN AND CHASE BRANDS, THE FIRM SERVES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. AND MANY OF THE WORLD’S MOST PROMINENT CORPORATE, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.”), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN

23

STATES, AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“CHASE BANK USA, N.A.”), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRM’S CREDIT CARD-ISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASE’S PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (“JPMORGAN SECURITIES”), THE FIRM’S U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS. ONE OF THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES IN THE

U.K.

IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

THE FIRM’S WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF CONDUCT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRM AND A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND ALL OTHER PROFESSIONALS OF THE FIRM WORLDWIDE SERVING IN A FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, TAX OR INVESTOR RELATIONS ROLE.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO

FOUR

MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE

SEGMENT. THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESS IS THE CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (“CCB”) SEGMENT. THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK (“CIB”), COMMERCIAL BANKING (“CB”), AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT (“AWM”) (FORMERLY ASSET MANAGEMENT OR “AM”).

A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE “BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS” SECTION

OF MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”), BEGINNING ON PAGE

36

AND IN NOTE 33.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, INVESTMENT MANAGERS, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AND OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN PROVIDING SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A NATIONAL OR REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES OR THAT OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT RULES AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAN THE FIRM, OR WITH COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE NEW OR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

THE FIRM IS

SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH

THE FIRM

DOES BUSINESS.

AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY REFORMS ENACTED AND PROPOSED IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD,

THE FIRM

HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN REGULATION WHICH HAS HAD AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR HOW

THE FIRM

CONDUCTS BUSINESS.

THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY IN ASSESSING THE REGULATORY CHANGES IT IS FACING, AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE NEW REGULATIONS, WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, ENDEAVORING TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND SHAREHOLDERS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS, AND APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE, AND CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF NUMEROUS RULE-MAKINGS BY MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND REGULATORS, AND THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OR INCONSISTENCIES AMONG SUCH

1

PART I

RULES, PRESENT CHALLENGES AND RISKS TO

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS,

THE FIRM

CANNOT CURRENTLY QUANTIFY ALL OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE UNDERWAY.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY.

CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE “FEDERAL RESERVE”)

. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (“BHC”) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION, REGULATION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACTS AS AN “UMBRELLA REGULATOR” AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE’S NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“OCC”)

AND, WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE “FDIC”).

CERTAIN NON-BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS

THE FIRM’S

U.S. BROKER-DEALERS, ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE

SEC, AND SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM THAT ENGAGE IN

CERTAIN FUTURES-RELATED AND SWAPS-RELATED ACTIVITIES

ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (“CFTC”). J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC, IS A U.K. BANK LICENSED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (THE “EEA”) TO UNDERTAKE ALL BANKING ACTIVITY AND IS REGULATED BY THE U.K. PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (THE “PRA”), A SUBSIDIARY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRUDENTIAL REGULATION OF BANKS AND OTHER SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS, AND BY THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (“FCA”), WHICH REGULATES PRUDENTIAL MATTERS FOR FIRMS THAT ARE NOT SO REGULATED BY THE PRA AND CONDUCT MATTERS FOR ALL MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRM’S

OTHER NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED BY THE BANKING AND SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. SEE SECURITIES AND BROKER-DEALER REGULATION, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION AND DERIVATIVES REGULATION BELOW. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM’S

CONSUMER ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (“CFPB”)

AND TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS STATE STATUTES WHICH ARE ENFORCED BY THE RESPECTIVE STATE’S ATTORNEY GENERAL.

SCOPE OF PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT GENERALLY RESTRICTS BHCS FROM ENGAGING IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS OF BANKING AND CERTAIN CLOSELY RELATED ACTIVITIES. FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY CAN ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES THAN ARE OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE FOR BHCS,

INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND MAKING MARKETS IN SECURITIES, AND MAKING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS IN NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO LIMIT A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY’S ABILITY TO CONDUCT OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES IF THE FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS DEPOSITARY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES CEASES TO MEET THE APPLICABLE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE

FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAIN THEIR STATUS AS “WELL-CAPITALIZED” AND “WELL-MANAGED”).

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY ALSO IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANY’S DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MUST OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL BEFORE ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER REGULATION OF ACQUISITIONS BELOW.

ACTIVITIES RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE.

SECTION 619 OF THE WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”) (THE “VOLCKER RULE”) PROHIBITS BANKING ENTITIES, INCLUDING

THE FIRM

, FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN “PROPRIETARY TRADING” ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS FOR UNDERWRITING, MARKET-MAKING, RISK-MITIGATING HEDGING AND CERTAIN OTHER ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE VOLCKER RULE LIMITS THE SPONSORSHIP OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, “COVERED FUNDS” (AS DEFINED BY THE VOLCKER RULE) AND IMPOSES LIMITS ON CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

THE FIRM

AND ITS SPONSORED FUNDS (SEE JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARY BANKS — RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES BELOW). THE VOLCKER RULE REQUIRES BANKING ENTITIES TO ESTABLISH COMPREHENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE AND MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE, INCLUDING, IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH PERMISSIBLE FROM IMPERMISSIBLE RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES, THE MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND REPORTING OF CERTAIN KEY METRICS.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR

THE FIRM

AND EVALUATES ITS COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR

THE FIRM’S

NATIONAL BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE IN THE U.S. UNDER THE MOST RECENT CAPITAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE “BASEL COMMITTEE”)(“BASEL III”)

, SEE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 76–85

AND NOTE 28.

UNDER BASEL III, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS ARE REQUIRED TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST TWO SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS: THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (“LCR”) AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (“NSFR”). THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE APPROVED THE FINAL LCR RULE (“U.S. LCR”), WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015. IN APRIL 2016, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE FOR NSFR.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE RATIOS, SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 110–115.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED FINAL

2

U.S. LCR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. STARTING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017,

THE FIRM

WILL BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE QUARTERLY ITS CONSOLIDATED LCR PURSUANT TO THE U.S. LCR RULE, INCLUDING

THE FIRM’S

AVERAGE LCR FOR THE QUARTER AND THE KEY QUANTITATIVE COMPONENTS OF THE AVERAGE LCR IN A STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE, ALONG WITH A QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL DRIVERS OF THE RATIO, CHANGES OVER TIME, AND CAUSES OF SUCH CHANGES. ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED THE FRAMEWORK THAT WILL APPLY TO THE SETTING OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER. AS OF OCTOBER 24, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE REAFFIRMED SETTING THE U.S. COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AT 0%, AND STATED THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE AMOUNT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

BANKING SUPERVISORS CONTINUE TO CONSIDER REFINEMENTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO THE BASEL III CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE FINALIZED REVISIONS TO MARKET RISK CAPITAL FOR TRADING BOOKS AND THE TREATMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK; OTHER PROPOSALS BEING CONTEMPLATED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE INCLUDE REVISIONS TO, AMONG OTHERS,

STANDARDIZED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL FRAMEWORKS

,

A RECALIBRATION OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO, REVISIONS TO THE SECURITIZATION FRAMEWORK, AND CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULTED ASSETS. IN JANUARY 2017, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THAT THE REVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS TO FINALIZE THE POST-CRISIS REGULATORY REFORMS HAS BEEN POSTPONED. AFTER A PROPOSAL IS FINALIZED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE, U.S. BANKING REGULATORS WOULD THEN NEED TO PROPOSE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

IN MARCH 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RELEASED A REVISED PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS FOR LARGE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND FOREIGN BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.

STRESS TESTS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ADOPTED SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE, WHICH FORM PART OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”) FRAMEWORK. UNDER THE FRAMEWORK,

THE FIRM

MUST CONDUCT SEMI-ANNUAL COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTS AND, IN ADDITION, MUST SUBMIT AN ANNUAL CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RESULTS OF SEPARATE STRESS TESTS DESIGNED BY

THE FIRM

AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN REVIEWING

THE FIRM’S

CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE CONSIDERS BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE PLAN, THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS UNDERLYING THE PLAN, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

THE FIRM

HAS SATISFIED CERTAIN SUPERVISORY MATTERS RELATED TO

THE FIRM’S

PROCESSES AND ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROLS GOVERNING SUCH PROCESSES. MOREOVER,

THE FIRM

IS REQUIRED TO RECEIVE A NOTICE OF NON-OBJECTION FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE TAKING CAPITAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS PAYING DIVIDENDS, IMPLEMENTING COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAMS OR REDEEMING OR REPURCHASING CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. THE OCC REQUIRES JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. TO PERFORM SEPARATE, SIMILAR ANNUAL STRESS TESTS.

THE FIRM

PUBLISHES EACH YEAR THE RESULTS OF ITS MID-CYCLE STRESS TESTS UNDER

THE FIRM’S

INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED “SEVERELY ADVERSE” SCENARIO AND THE RESULTS OF ITS

(AND ITS TWO PRIMARY SUBSIDIARY BANKS’) ANNUAL STRESS TESTS UNDER THE SUPERVISORY “SEVERELY ADVERSE” SCENARIOS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OCC.

THE FIRM

WILL FILE ITS 2017 ANNUAL CCAR SUBMISSION ON APRIL 5. RESULTS WILL BE PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY JUNE 30, WITH DISCLOSURES OF RESULTS BY BHCS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM,

TO FOLLOW WITHIN 15 DAYS. THE MID-CYCLE CAPITAL STRESS TEST SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE ON OCTOBER 5 AND BHCS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM

, WILL PUBLISH RESULTS BY NOVEMBER 4.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S CCAR, SEE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 76–85.

ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS.

THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (“FSOC”), AMONG OTHER THINGS, RECOMMENDS PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS AND REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (“SIFIS”), SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ADOPTED SEVERAL RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING FINAL RULES RELATING TO RISK MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF SUBJECT BHCS. BHCS WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ENHANCED LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, AND THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

FOR INFORMATION ON LIQUIDITY MEASURES, SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 110–115.

SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PROPOSED RULES ARE STILL BEING CONSIDERED, INCLUDING AN “EARLY REMEDIATION” FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR MATERIAL MANAGEMENT WEAKNESSES.

ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY AND RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY.

AS A BHC WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE,

THE FIRM

IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC A PLAN FOR RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (A “RESOLUTION PLAN”). THE FDIC ALSO REQUIRES EACH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN ASSETS

, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.,

TO PROVIDE A RESOLUTION PLAN.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN, SEE RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21

AS WELL AS BUSINESS OVERVIEW ON

PAGES 37–38

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRM’S 2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, CAN BE SUBJECTED TO RESOLUTION UNDER AN “ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY.” THE U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MUST FIRST MAKE CERTAIN EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND SYSTEMIC RISK DETERMINATIONS, AND ACTION MUST BE RECOMMENDED BY THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE. ABSENT SUCH ACTIONS,

THE FIRM

, AS A BHC, WOULD REMAIN SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE FDIC ISSUED A DRAFT POLICY STATEMENT DESCRIBING ITS “SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY” STRATEGY FOR RESOLUTION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY. THIS STRATEGY SEEKS TO KEEP OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES OF THE BHC OPEN AND IMPOSE LOSSES ON SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY IN

3

PART I

RECEIVERSHIP ACCORDING TO THEIR STATUTORY ORDER OF PRIORITY.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION SEE RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21.

THE FIRM

HAS A COMPREHENSIVE RECOVERY PLAN DETAILING THE ACTIONS IT WOULD TAKE TO AVOID FAILURE BY REMAINING WELL-CAPITALIZED AND WELL-FUNDED IN THE CASE OF AN ADVERSE EVENT. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS PROVIDED THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH COMPREHENSIVE CONFIDENTIAL SUPERVISORY INFORMATION AND ANALYSES ABOUT

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESSES, LEGAL ENTITIES AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ABOUT ITS CRISIS MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE, CAPABILITIES AND AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES TO RAISE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL IN SEVERE MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES. THE OCC HAS PUBLISHED GUIDELINES ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR RECOVERY PLANNING BY INSURED NATIONAL BANKS, AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR RECOVERY PLANS TO THE OCC.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION SEE RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF

THE FIRM’S

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING REQUIREMENTS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

REGULATORS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING MEASURES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY OR PERCEPTION THAT LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM,

MAY BE “TOO BIG TO FAIL,” AND TO PROVIDE SAFEGUARDS SO THAT, IF A LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DOES FAIL, IT CAN BE RESOLVED WITHOUT THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS. HIGHER CAPITAL SURCHARGES ON

GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (“GSIBS”),

REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT TO FACILITATE ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF THOSE FIRMS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION (“ISDA”) PROTOCOL RELATING TO THE “CLOSE-OUT” OF DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS DURING THE RESOLUTION OF A LARGE CROSS-BORDER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, ARE EXAMPLES OF INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS “TOO BIG TO FAIL.”

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ON THE GSIB FRAMEWORK AND TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY (“TLAC”), SEE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 76–85

AND RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21

, AND

ON THE ISDA CLOSE-OUT PROTOCOL, SEE DERIVATIVES REGULATION BELOW.

HOLDING COMPANY AS SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES

. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS REQUIRED TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AT TIMES WHEN

THE FIRM

MIGHT OTHERWISE DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT.

REGULATION OF ACQUISITIONS.

ACQUISITIONS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANKS ARE SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE REQUIREMENTS BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OCC. FOR EXAMPLE, FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE MORE THAN 5% OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN UNAFFILIATED BANK. IN ADDITION, ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES ARE PROHIBITED IF, AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED 10% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, FOR CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS,

THE FIRM

MUST PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF

ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY WITH OVER $10 BILLION IN ASSETS THAT IS ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE “FINANCIAL IN NATURE.”

JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARY BANKS.

THE FIRM’S

TWO PRIMARY SUBSIDIARY BANKS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE FDIC-INSURED NATIONAL BANKS REGULATED BY THE OCC. AS NATIONAL BANKS, THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE LIMITED TO THOSE SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE NATIONAL BANK ACT AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS BY THE OCC.

FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN DEPOSITS AND IS FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. CHANGES IN THE METHODOLOGY USED TO CALCULATE SUCH ASSESSMENTS, RESULTING FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE ASSESSMENTS THAT

THE FIRM’S

BANK SUBSIDIARIES PAY ANNUALLY TO THE FDIC. THE FDIC INSTITUTED A NEW ASSESSMENT SURCHARGE ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS GREATER THAN $10 BILLION IN ORDER TO RAISE THE RESERVE RATIO FOR THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND. FUTURE FDIC RULE-MAKING COULD FURTHER INCREASE SUCH ASSESSMENTS.

FDIC POWERS UPON A BANK INSOLVENCY.

UPON THE INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., THE FDIC COULD BE APPOINTED AS THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (“FDIA”).

THE FDIC HAS BROAD POWERS TO TRANSFER ANY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE INSTITUTION’S CREDITORS.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT TO CREDITORS, SEE RISK FACTORS ON

PAGES 8–21.

CROSS-GUARANTEE.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IF ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION THAT IS UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION IS IN DEFAULT OR IS DEEMED TO BE “IN DANGER OF DEFAULT” (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “CROSS-GUARANTEE” LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION AND EARLY REMEDIATION.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE “PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION” WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. WHILE THESE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST THE PARENT BHC, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF ANY BANK SUBSIDIARY. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE BHC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN FOR ITS UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY.

OCC HEIGHTENED STANDARDS.

THE OCC HAS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES SETTING FORTH HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR LARGE BANKS. THE GUIDELINES ESTABLISH MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR BANKS. WHILE THE BANK CAN USE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, THE FRAMEWORK MUST ENSURE THAT THE BANK’S RISK PROFILE IS EASILY DISTINGUISHED AND SEPARATE FROM THE PARENT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE BANK’S BOARD OR RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING THE BANK’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, PROVIDING ACTIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE BANK’S RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES, AND HOLDING MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ADHERING TO THE RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE (INCLUDING SUBSIDIARIES OF THOSE BANKS)

ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF, AND DERIVATIVES, SECURITIES LENDING AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM

SUCH SUBSIDIARIES

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS AND COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OTHER REQUIREMENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE

27.

IN ADDITION, THE VOLCKER RULE IMPOSES A PROHIBITION ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN ANY JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY AND COVERED FUNDS FOR WHICH A JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY SERVES AS THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, INVESTMENT ADVISOR, COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR OR SPONSOR, AS WELL AS, SUBJECT TO A LIMITED EXCEPTION, ANY COVERED FUND CONTROLLED BY SUCH FUNDS.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. SEE NOTE 27

FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT

THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES

COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2017, TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF

THEIR

BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS OF THE

BANK SUBSIDIARIES THEY SUPERVISE

, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATOR’S OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANK.

DEPOSITOR PREFERENCE.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC AND FOREIGN DEPOSITS THAT ARE PAYABLE IN THE U.S. AS WELL AS IN A FOREIGN BRANCH) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES. AS A RESULT, SUCH PERSONS COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

CFPB REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, AND OTHER CONSUMER REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY THE CFPB WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS, INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO FAIR LENDING AND THE PROHIBITION OF UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER, SALE OR PROVISION OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE LAWS INCLUDE THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (“ECOA”), FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER, CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE (“CARD”) AND HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACTS. THE CFPB HAS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR SERVICE. THE CFPB’S RULE-MAKING EFFORTS HAVE ADDRESSED MORTGAGE-RELATED TOPICS, INCLUDING ABILITY TO REPAY AND QUALIFIED MORTGAGE STANDARDS, MORTGAGE SERVICING STANDARDS, LOAN ORIGINATOR COMPENSATION STANDARDS, HIGH-COST MORTGAGE REQUIREMENTS, HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACT REQUIREMENTS, APPRAISAL AND ESCROW STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGHER-PRICED MORTGAGES. THE CFPB CONTINUES TO ISSUE INFORMAL GUIDANCE ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS (SUCH AS THE COLLECTION OF CONSUMER DEBTS AND CREDIT CARD MARKETING PRACTICES). OTHER AREAS OF FOCUS INCLUDE SALES INCENTIVES, PRE-AUTHORIZED ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS, “ADD-ON” PRODUCTS, MATTERS INVOLVING CONSUMER POPULATIONS CONSIDERED VULNERABLE BY THE CFPB (SUCH AS STUDENTS), CREDIT REPORTING, AND THE FURNISHING OF CREDIT SCORES TO INDIVIDUALS. AS PART OF ITS REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, THE CFPB HAS TAKEN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM.

SECURITIES AND BROKER-DEALER REGULATION.

THE FIRM

CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. THROUGH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AMONG OTHERS.

THE FIRM

CONDUCTS SIMILAR SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE U.K., THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED BY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC AND ARE REGULATED PRA AND THE FCA. BROKER-DEALERS ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS, INCLUDING SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES, SECURITIES OFFERINGS, PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH REPORTS, USE OF CUSTOMERS’ FUNDS, THE FINANCING OF CLIENTS’ PURCHASES, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RECORD-KEEPING AND RETENTION, AND THE CONDUCT OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.

FOR INFORMATION ON THE NET CAPITAL OF J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC, AND THE APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL FOR J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC, SEE BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL ON

PAGE 85.

IN ADDITION, RULES ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WOULD IMPOSE (AMONG OTHER THINGS) A NEW STANDARD OF CARE APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS WHEN DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS. FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE - INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION BELOW.

PART I

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION.

THE FIRM’S

ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT REGULATION IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS, OFFERINGS OF FUNDS, MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS AMONG AFFILIATES AND MANAGEMENT OF CLIENT FUNDS. CERTAIN OF

THE FIRM’S

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH, AND SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY, THE SEC AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS. AS SUCH,

THE FIRM’S

REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FIDUCIARY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE SECURITIES LAWS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION IN CONNECTION WITH DISCLOSURES TO CLIENTS RELATED TO PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, SEE NOTE

31.

THE FIRM’S

ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY ONGOING RULE-MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW REGULATIONS. THE SEC AMENDMENTS TO RULES THAT GOVERN MONEY-MARKET FUNDS, REQUIRING A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE FOR INSTITUTIONAL PRIME MONEY-MARKET FUNDS

BECAME EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 14, 2016. IN ADDITION, THE SEC ADOPTED AMENDMENTS REGARDING ENHANCED LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FOR OPEN-END MUTUAL FUNDS AND EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (“ETFS”) AND ENHANCED REPORTING FOR FUNDS AND ADVISORS.

THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (“DOL”) “FIDUCIARY” RULE WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF PERSONS VIEWED AS INVESTMENT ADVICE FIDUCIARIES TO RETIREMENT PLANS AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (“IRAS”) UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”).

AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF THE RULE AND RELATED PROHIBITED TRANSACTION EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON THE FEE AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER INVESTMENT ADVICE TO RETAIL RETIREMENT CLIENTS. THE RELATED EXEMPTIONS WOULD REQUIRE NEW CLIENT CONTRACTS, ADHERENCE TO “IMPARTIAL CONDUCT” STANDARDS (INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT TO ACT IN THE “BEST INTEREST” OF RETIREMENT CLIENTS), IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WEBSITES AND OTHER DISCLOSURES TO BOTH INVESTORS AND THE DOL.

THE RULE WAS DUE TO BECOME APPLICABLE FROM APRIL 10, 2017; HOWEVER FOLLOWING A RECENT MEMORANDUM FROM THE WHITE HOUSE DIRECTING REVIEW OF THE RULE, THE DOL ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS CONSIDERING LEGAL OPTIONS FOR DELAYING THE RULE’S APPLICABILITY.

DERIVATIVES REGULATION.

THE FIRM

IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF ITS DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES. THE REGULATIONS IMPOSE CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING THE COLLECTING AND POSTING OF VARIATION MARGIN AND INITIAL MARGIN IN RESPECT OF NON-CENTRALLY CLEARED DERIVATIVES), REQUIRE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC”) DERIVATIVES, REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAPS BE TRADED ON REGULATED TRADING VENUES, AND PROVIDE FOR REPORTING OF CERTAIN MANDATED INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT REQUIRES THE REGISTRATION OF “SWAP DEALERS” AND “MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS” WITH THE CFTC AND OF “SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS” AND “MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS” WITH THE SEC. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P. MORGAN

SECURITIES LLC, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC AND J.P. MORGAN VENTURES ENERGY CORPORATION HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS SWAP DEALERS, AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC MAY BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE SEC AS SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS. AS A RESULT OF THEIR REGISTRATION AS SWAP DEALERS OR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, THESE ENTITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO THEIR SWAP OR SECURITY-BASED SWAP ACTIVITIES, WHICH INCLUDES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, RULES REGULATING THEIR SWAP ACTIVITIES, RULES REQUIRING THE COLLATERALIZATION OF UNCLEARED SWAPS, RULES REGARDING SEGREGATION OF COUNTERPARTY COLLATERAL, BUSINESS CONDUCT AND DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS, RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS, AND ANTI-FRAUD AND ANTI-MANIPULATION REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, SOME OF THE RULES FOR DERIVATIVES APPLY EXTRATERRITORIALLY TO U.S. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH CLIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., AS WELL AS TO THE OVERSEAS ACTIVITIES OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF

THE FIRM

THAT EITHER DEAL WITH U.S. PERSONS OR THAT ARE GUARANTEED BY U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF

THE FIRM

; HOWEVER, THE FULL SCOPE OF THE EXTRA-TERRITORIAL IMPACT OF THE U.S. SWAPS REGULATION HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED AND THEREFORE REMAINS UNCLEAR. THE EFFECT OF THESE RULES MAY REQUIRE BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS

THE FIRM

, TO MODIFY THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES AND FACE INCREASED OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY COSTS. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE “EU”), THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION (“EMIR”) AND THE REVISION OF THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE (“MIFID II”) WILL RESULT IN COMPARABLE, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN REGULATORY REGIME FOR DERIVATIVES. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE U.S. AND EU REQUIREMENTS, AND THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THEM, PRESENT CHALLENGES AND RISKS TO THE STRUCTURE AND OPERATING MODEL OF

THE FIRM’S

DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES.

THE FIRM

AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AGREED TO ADHERE TO AN UPDATED RESOLUTION STAY PROTOCOL DEVELOPED BY ISDA IN RESPONSE TO REGULATOR CONCERNS THAT THE CLOSE-OUT OF DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS DURING THE RESOLUTION OF A LARGE CROSS-BORDER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COULD IMPEDE RESOLUTION EFFORTS AND POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZE MARKETS. THE RESOLUTION STAY PROTOCOL PROVIDES FOR THE CONTRACTUAL RECOGNITION OF CROSS-BORDER STAYS UNDER VARIOUS STATUTORY RESOLUTION REGIMES AND A CONTRACTUAL STAY ON CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT RIGHTS.

IN THE U.S., ONE SUBSIDIARY OF

THE FIRM

IS REGISTERED AS A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE EITHER REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS OR ARE EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION.

DATA REGULATION.

THE FIRM

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND OTHER PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND THE FAIR CREDIT

6

REPORTING ACT, AS WELL AS THE EU DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE. IN ADDITION, VARIOUS U.S. REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE SEC, HAVE INCREASED THEIR FOCUS ON CYBERSECURITY THROUGH GUIDANCE, EXAMINATIONS AND REGULATIONS.

IN MAY 2018, THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”) WILL REPLACE THE EU DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, AND IT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW BUSINESSES CAN COLLECT AND PROCESS THE PERSONAL DATA OF EU INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS PROPOSALS REGARDING PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ARE PENDING BEFORE U.S. AND NON-U.S. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY BODIES.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT (“BSA”) REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM. THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH TRANSACTION AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE DILIGENCE/KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. IN JANUARY 2013,

THE FIRM

ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS RELATING TO

THE FIRM’S

BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS;

THE FIRM

HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO MODIFY AND ENHANCE ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO ITS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROCEDURES AND TO REMEDIATE THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE CONSENT ORDER.

THE FIRM

IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. TREASURY’S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (“OFAC”).

ANTI-CORRUPTION.

THE FIRM

IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORRUPT AND ILLEGAL PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSENT JUDGMENT AND NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT RELATING TO REFERRAL HIRING PRACTICES, SEE NOTE

31.

COMPENSATION PRACTICES.

THE FIRM’S

COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS OTHER AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE JOINTLY WITH THE FDIC AND THE OCC THAT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAID BY BANKING ORGANIZATIONS DOES NOT ENCOURAGE IMPRUDENT RISK-TAKING THAT THREATENS THE ORGANIZATIONS’ SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, FEDERAL REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, MUST ISSUE REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES REQUIRING COVERED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM

, TO REPORT THE STRUCTURE OF ALL INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AND PROHIBIT INCENTIVE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISKS BY PROVIDING COMPENSATION THAT IS EXCESSIVE OR THAT COULD LEAD TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE INSTITUTION. PROPOSED REGULATIONS WERE ISSUED IN 2016, AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD HAS CLOSED. FINAL REGULATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

PUBLISHED. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF A NUMBER OF LARGE BANKING INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD HAS ESTABLISHED STANDARDS COVERING COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES FOR BANKS. IN EUROPE, THE FOURTH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE (“CRD IV”) INCLUDES COMPENSATION PROVISIONS AND THE EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY HAS INSTITUTED GUIDELINES ON COMPENSATION POLICIES UNDER CRD IV. IN THE U.K., COMPENSATION STANDARDS ARE GOVERNED BY THE REMUNERATION CODE OF THE PRA AND THE FCA. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S AND OTHER BANKING REGULATORS’ GUIDELINES REGARDING COMPENSATION ARE EXPECTED TO EVOLVE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, AND MAY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE FIRM

STRUCTURES ITS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES.

SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY INITIATIVES.

IN THE EU, THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX PROGRAM OF FINAL AND PROPOSED REGULATORY ENHANCEMENT THAT REFLECTS, IN PART, THE EU’S COMMITMENTS TO POLICIES OF THE GROUP OF TWENTY FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS (“G-20”) TOGETHER WITH OTHER PLANS SPECIFIC TO THE EU. THE EU OPERATES A EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD THAT MONITORS FINANCIAL STABILITY, TOGETHER WITH EUROPEAN SUPERVISORY AGENCIES THAT SET DETAILED REGULATORY RULES AND ENCOURAGE SUPERVISORY CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE 28 MEMBER STATES. THE EU HAS ALSO CREATED A SINGLE SUPERVISORY MECHANISM FOR THE EURO-ZONE, UNDER WHICH THE REGULATION OF ALL BANKS IN THAT ZONE WILL BE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, TOGETHER WITH A SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM AND SINGLE RESOLUTION BOARD, HAVING JURISDICTION OVER BANK RESOLUTION IN THE ZONE. AT BOTH THE G-20 AND EU LEVELS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION TO ADDRESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THE INITIATIVES ADOPTED INCLUDE INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRADING INSTRUMENTS OR EXPOSURES AND COMPENSATION LIMITS ON CERTAIN EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES.

GUIDED BY THE G20 POLICY FRAMEWORK, THE EU AND NATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED SEVERAL MARKET REFORMS, INCLUDING EMIR, WHICH REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES; AND MIFID II, WHICH GIVES EFFECT TO THE G-20 COMMITMENT TO TRADING OF DERIVATIVES THROUGH CENTRAL CLEARING HOUSES AND EXCHANGES AND ALSO INCLUDES SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS FOR PRE- AND POST-TRADE TRANSPARENCY AND A SIGNIFICANT RECONFIGURATION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION OF EXECUTION VENUES. KEY ASPECTS OF EMIR AND MIFID II HAVE BEEN FINALIZED, ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF MIFID II HAS BEEN DELAYED TO 2018.

THE EU IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONSIDERING OR IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO LAWS COVERING DEPOSITARY ACTIVITIES; CREDIT-RATING ACTIVITIES; RESOLUTION OF BANKS, INVESTMENT FIRMS AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES; ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROLS; DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN FINANCIAL FIRMS; AND IMPLEMENTATION IN THE EU OF THE BASEL III CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF

7

PART I

AN INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY REQUIREMENT FOR FOREIGN BANKS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARD FOR TLAC.

THE EU IS ALSO CONSIDERING PROPOSED LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR A PROPRIETARY TRADING BAN AND MANDATORY SEPARATION OF OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES WITHIN CERTAIN BANKS; VARIOUS EU MEMBER STATES HAVE SEPARATELY ENACTED SIMILAR MEASURES. IN THE U.K., LEGISLATION WAS ADOPTED THAT MANDATES THE SEPARATION (OR “RING-FENCING”) OF DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES FROM SECURITIES TRADING AND OTHER ANALOGOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN BANKS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. THE LEGISLATION INCLUDES THE SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION ON BANKING STANDARDS (THE “TYRIE COMMISSION”) THAT SUCH RING-FENCES SHOULD BE “ELECTRIFIED” BY THE IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY FORCED SEPARATION ON BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF THE SAFEGUARDS. PARALLEL BUT DISTINCT PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY THE FRENCH AND GERMAN GOVERNMENTS. THESE MEASURES MAY SEPARATELY OR TAKEN TOGETHER HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR

THE FIRM’S

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IN EUROPE, AS WELL AS ITS PERMITTED ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT IN THE EU.

MUCH OF THE G20 POLICY FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN FINALIZED; HOWEVER, THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE FRAMEWORK, AND PROPOSING RECALIBRATIONS OF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. AS SUCH, THE EU IS CONSIDERING OR IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO LAWS COVERING: BANK AND INVESTMENT FIRM RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION; BANK STRUCTURE; SECURITIES SETTLEMENT; TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS; BENCHMARKS; RESOLUTION OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES (CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES (“CCPS”)); ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROLS; DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN FINANCIAL FIRMS; TOGETHER WITH NEW AMENDMENTS TO CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE G20 AND EU POLICY FRAMEWORKS, U.K. REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED A RANGE OF POLICY MEASURES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE MARKETS AND PRUDENTIAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.K. IN ADDITION TO BROAD RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE FAIR AND EFFECTIVE MARKETS REVIEW WHICH FOCUSED ON FIXED INCOME CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES MARKETS, U.K. REGULATORS ARE CONSIDERING MEASURES TO RAISE STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS, AND PROMOTE FORWARD-LOOKING CONDUCT RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION, INCLUDING BY INTRODUCING THE NEW SENIOR MANAGERS AND CERTIFICATION REGIMES.

ON JUNE 23, 2016, THE U.K. VOTED BY REFERENDUM TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (“BREXIT”). THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAS SINCE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL INVOKE ARTICLE 50 OF THE LISBON TREATY AND WILL START THE FORMAL EXIT NEGOTIATIONS BY THE END OF MARCH 2017, GIVING AN EXPECTED EXIT DATE OF THE END OF MARCH 2019. MORE RECENTLY, THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER

LAID OUT TWELVE “NEGOTIATION OBJECTIVES” FOR BREXIT, WHICH CONFIRMED THE U.K. WILL NOT REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE SINGLE MARKET, BUT WILL PURSUE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET. FURTHER, THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK A PHASED ARRANGEMENT TO ENSURE THE ORDERLY TRANSITION OF THE LEGAL

AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES, AND PROMOTE STABILITY AND MARKET CONFIDENCE. FOLLOWING A RECENT RULING BY THE U.K. SUPREME COURT, THE HOUSE OF COMMONS APPROVED LEGISLATION ON FEBRUARY 8, 2017 THAT ALLOWS THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TO INVOKE ARTICLE 50. THE LEGISLATION MUST NOW BE APPROVED BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS BEFORE IT IS SIGNED INTO LAW.

MANY INTERNATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

THE FIRM,

OPERATE SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR EUROPEAN UNION BUSINESSES FROM ENTITIES BASED IN THE U.K. UPON THE U.K. LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD THEN EXIST, AND TO WHICH

THE FIRM’S

U.K. OPERATIONS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT, WILL DEPEND ON, IN CERTAIN RESPECTS, THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS THE U.K. AGREED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER TRADING PARTNERS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS CANNOT BE PREDICTED, BUT CURRENTLY

THE FIRM

DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE LIKELY IDENTIFIED SCENARIOS WOULD THREATEN THE VIABILITY OF

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESS UNITS OR

THE FIRM’S

ABILITY TO SERVE CLIENTS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN THE U.K. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER SOME SCENARIOS, CHANGES TO

THE FIRM’S

LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED, WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN A LESS EFFICIENT OPERATING MODEL ACROSS

THE FIRM’S

EUROPEAN LEGAL ENTITIES.

THE FIRM

IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING PLANS TO ENSURE ITS CONTINUED ABILITY TO OPERATE IN THE U.K. AND THE EU BEYOND THE EXPECTED EXIT DATE.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH THE MATERIAL RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

REGULATORY RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT.

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS IN RECENT YEARS EXPERIENCED AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE NEW AND CURRENTLY PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESSES OR OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE FIRM AND IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE AND OTHER COSTS ON THE FIRM OR OTHERWISE REDUCE THE FIRM’S PROFITABILITY. THESE CHANGES COULD ALSO: LIMIT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THE FIRM OFFERS; REDUCE THE LIQUIDITY THAT THE FIRM IS ABLE TO OFFER ITS CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES THROUGH ITS MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES; IMPEDE THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING; REQUIRE THE FIRM TO DISPOSE OF OR CURTAIL CERTAIN

8

BUSINESSES; AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS; REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS; OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN, OR CONTINUE TO BE, IMPOSED ON A LIMITED SUBSET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (BASED ON SIZE, ACTIVITIES, GEOGRAPHY OR OTHER CRITERIA), THE REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT UNDER SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO RESTRUCTURE FURTHER ITS BUSINESSES, OR FURTHER RE-PRICE OR CURTAIL THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT IT OFFERS TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE FIRM NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT IMPACTED IN THE SAME WAY.

AUTHORITIES IN SOME NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS OPERATIONS HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING THAT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM OPERATING IN THOSE COUNTRIES MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY. IN ADDITION, SOME NON-U.S. REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED THAT LARGE BANKS WHICH CONDUCT CERTAIN BUSINESSES IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS OPERATE THROUGH SEPARATE SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED IN THOSE COUNTRIES. THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND ANY FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SEEK TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE WAY THE FIRM ORGANIZES ITS BUSINESS UNITS OR INCREASE THE CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM, COULD HINDER THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS, INCREASE ITS FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY COSTS AND  THEREBY DECREASE THE FIRM’S NET INCOME. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS THAT SIMILAR REGULATORY INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN THE U.S. AND IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND REGIONS IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE DOES BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES WITHIN THE EU, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO THE RESOLUTION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE ESTABLISHMENT BY NON-EU FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANIES IN THE EU, THE SEPARATION OF TRADING ACTIVITIES FROM CORE BANKING SERVICES, MANDATORY ON-EXCHANGE TRADING, POSITION LIMITS AND REPORTING RULES FOR DERIVATIVES, GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY REGIMES, CONDUCT OF BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMPENSATION, COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS TO ITS NON-U.S. BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS. THESE DIFFERENCES IN IMPLEMENTED OR PROPOSED NON-U.S. REGULATIONS AND INITIATIVES MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR MAY CONFLICT WITH CURRENT OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN THE U.S., WHICH COULD SUBJECT THE FIRM TO INCREASED COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL COSTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER OPERATIONAL, CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD HAVE INCREASED THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE FIRM WILL OPERATE. ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE PROPOSALS BEING MENTIONED IN THE U.S. INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF REGULATORY REFORM RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE THE FULL EXTENT TO WHICH THESE MEASURES WILL ULTIMATELY MODIFY OR REDUCE THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CURRENTLY IMPOSED ON THE FIRM, AND THE RESULTING POSSIBLE EFFECT ON THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE U.K.’S PLANNED

DEPARTURE FROM THE EU HAS ENGENDERED SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE, WILL NEED TO CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS IN THE EU AFTER THE U.K.’S DEPARTURE.

EXPANDED REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE FIRM’S COSTS AND RISKS.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY. THE FIRM HAS PAID SIGNIFICANT FINES (OR HAS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT MONETARY AND OTHER RELIEF) TO RESOLVE A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATORY CONSENT ORDERS AND OTHER SETTLEMENTS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, WHICH INCREASES THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.

CERTAIN REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN MEASURES IN CONNECTION WITH SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) THAT REQUIRE ADMISSIONS OF WRONGDOING AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SETTLING SUCH MATTERS. SUCH ADMISSIONS AND CONDITIONS CAN LEAD TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GREATER EXPOSURE IN CIVIL LITIGATION, HARM TO REPUTATION, DISQUALIFICATION FROM PROVIDING BUSINESS TO CERTAIN CLIENTS AND IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, AND OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT ADVERSE EFFECTS.

IN ADDITION, U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED AND DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO BRING CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, AND HAVE INCREASINGLY SOUGHT, AND OBTAINED, RESOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE CRIMINAL PLEAS OR OTHER ADMISSIONS OF WRONGDOING FROM THOSE INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE FIRM’S AGREEMENT IN MAY 2015 TO PLEAD GUILTY TO A SINGLE VIOLATION OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SETTLEMENTS WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES RELATING TO ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE SALES AND TRADING ACTIVITIES AND CONTROLS RELATED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES, AND THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN NOVEMBER 2016 IN CONNECTION WITH SETTLEMENTS TO RESOLVE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO A FORMER HIRING PROGRAM FOR CANDIDATES REFERRED BY CLIENTS, POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. SUCH RESOLUTIONS, WHETHER WITH U.S. OR NON-U.S. AUTHORITIES, COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES FOR A SUBJECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, INCLUDING LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS, OR THE INABILITY TO OFFER CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR LOSING PERMISSION TO OPERATE CERTAIN BUSINESSES, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (ABSENT THE FORBEARANCE OF, OR THE GRANTING OF WAIVERS BY, APPLICABLE REGULATORS).

THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT IT AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND THAT VIOLATIONS OF LAW WILL MORE FREQUENTLY BE MET WITH FORMAL AND PUNITIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTION, INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF SIGNIFICANT MONETARY AND OTHER SANCTIONS, RATHER THAN WITH INFORMAL SUPERVISORY ACTION. IN ADDITION, IF THE FIRM FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL SETTLEMENTS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, OR MORE

9

PART I

GENERALLY, TO MAINTAIN RISK AND CONTROL PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES THAT MEET THE HEIGHTENED STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY ITS REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO FURTHER ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, PAY ADDITIONAL FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, OR ACCEPT MATERIAL REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES. THE EXTENT OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE AND COULD, IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES THAT THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED FOR SUCH MATTERS.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF THE FIRM COULD REQUIRE JPMORGAN CHASE TO RESTRUCTURE OR REORGANIZE ITS BUSINESSES.

UNDER TITLE I OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT (“TITLE I”) AND FEDERAL RESERVE AND FDIC RULES, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AND SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC A DETAILED PLAN (THE “RESOLUTION PLAN”) FOR THE RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION, WITHOUT EXTRAORDINARY GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AND OTHER APPLICABLE INSOLVENCY LAWS IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OF THE FIRM.

IN APRIL 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC JOINTLY PROVIDED FIRM-SPECIFIC FEEDBACK ON THE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS OF EIGHT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT DOMESTIC BANKING INSTITUTIONS, AND DETERMINED THAT FIVE OF THESE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS, INCLUDING THAT OF THE FIRM, WERE NOT CREDIBLE OR WOULD NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE. IN ADDITION TO THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ALSO IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS WHICH WERE REQUIRED TO BE SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSED IN THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN DUE ON JULY 1, 2017. ON OCTOBER 1, 2016, THE FIRM FILED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS SUBMISSION (THE “2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION”) DESCRIBING HOW THE FIRM REMEDIATED THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES AND PROVIDING A STATUS REPORT OF ITS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS.

ON DECEMBER 13, 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ADVISED THE FIRM OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS THAT THE FIRM’S 2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION ADEQUATELY REMEDIATED THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM’S 2015 RESOLUTION PLAN IDENTIFIED BY THE AGENCIES. ON JULY 1, 2017, THE FIRM WILL FILE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN WHICH WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DESCRIBE HOW THE FIRM HAS REMEDIATED THE REMAINING SHORTCOMINGS IDENTIFIED BY THE AGENCIES IN APRIL 2016. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC WERE TO JOINTLY DETERMINE THAT THE FIRM DID NOT REMEDIATE THE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS, OR THAT THE FIRM’S 2017 RESOLUTION PLAN, OR ANY FUTURE UPDATE OF THAT PLAN, IS NOT CREDIBLE, AND THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REMEDY THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN A TIMELY MANNER, THE REGULATORS MAY JOINTLY IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON THE FIRM OR RESTRICTIONS ON GROWTH, ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM, AND COULD, IF SUCH DEFICIENCIES ARE NOT REMEDIED WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER SUCH A DETERMINATION, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO RESTRUCTURE, REORGANIZE OR DIVEST BUSINESSES, LEGAL ENTITIES, OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND/OR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS IN WAYS THAT COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A TITLE I RESOLUTION PLAN THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND FDIC DETERMINE IS CREDIBLE, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO ITS LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE AND TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FUNDING OR OPERATIONAL COSTS.

HOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WILL ABSORB LOSSES IF JPMORGAN CHASE WERE TO ENTER INTO A RESOLUTION.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED FINAL RULES (THE “TLAC RULES”) REGARDING THE MINIMUM LEVELS OF UNSECURED EXTERNAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING, AS WELL AS GUIDELINES DEFINING THE TERMS OF QUALIFYING DEBT INSTRUMENTS, TO ENSURE THAT ADEQUATE LEVELS OF DEBT ARE MAINTAINED AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL FOR PURPOSES OF RECAPITALIZING THE FIRM’S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES (“ELIGIBLE LTD”). IF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WERE TO ENTER INTO A RESOLUTION, EITHER IN A PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE OR IN A RECEIVERSHIP ADMINISTERED BY THE FDIC UNDER TITLE II OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, HOLDERS OF ELIGIBLE LTD AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE FIRM WILL ABSORB THE LOSSES OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS AFFILIATES.

UNDER THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN, THE FIRM’S PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY CONTEMPLATES THAT ONLY JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WOULD ENTER BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE PURSUANT TO A “SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY” RECAPITALIZATION STRATEGY. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE RECAPITALIZED AS NEEDED SO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE NORMAL OPERATIONS OR SUBSEQUENTLY BE WOUND DOWN IN AN ORDERLY MANNER. AS A RESULT, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S LOSSES AND ANY LOSSES INCURRED BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE IMPOSED FIRST ON HOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S EQUITY SECURITIES AND THEREAFTER ON UNSECURED CREDITORS, INCLUDING HOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S ELIGIBLE LTD AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES. CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF THOSE DEBT SECURITIES WOULD HAVE A JUNIOR POSITION TO THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S SUBSIDIARIES AND TO THE CLAIMS OF PRIORITY (AS DETERMINED BY STATUTE) AND SECURED CREDITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. ACCORDINGLY, IN A RESOLUTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, HOLDERS OF ELIGIBLE LTD AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WOULD REALIZE VALUE ONLY TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AS A SHAREHOLDER OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND ITS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, AND ONLY AFTER ANY CLAIMS OF PRIORITY AND SECURED CREDITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. HAVE BEEN FULLY REPAID. IF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WERE TO ENTER INTO A RESOLUTION, NONE OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR THE FDIC IS OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW THE FIRM’S PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY UNDER ITS RESOLUTION PLAN.

THE FDIC HAS SIMILARLY INDICATED THAT A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY RECAPITALIZATION MODEL COULD BE A DESIRABLE STRATEGY TO RESOLVE A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., UNDER TITLE II OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. PURSUANT TO THAT STRATEGY, THE FDIC WOULD USE ITS POWER TO CREATE A “BRIDGE ENTITY” FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.;

10

TRANSFER THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND VIABLE PARTS OF ITS BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY THE STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S MAIN OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE BRIDGE ENTITY; RECAPITALIZE THOSE SUBSIDIARIES USING ASSETS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE BRIDGE ENTITY; AND EXCHANGE EXTERNAL DEBT CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FOR EQUITY IN THE BRIDGE ENTITY. UNDER THIS TITLE II RESOLUTION STRATEGY, THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE BRIDGE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE REDISTRIBUTED TO HOLDERS OF ELIGIBLE LTD AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY ALL OR PART OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND INTEREST ON SUCH SECURITIES. TO DATE, THE FDIC HAS NOT FORMALLY ADOPTED A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY RESOLUTION STRATEGY AND IT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW SUCH A STRATEGY IN A TITLE II RESOLUTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES (INCLUDING OIL PRICES) AND OTHER MARKET INDICES; INVESTOR, CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS, HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS, SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES, TERRORISM OR OTHER GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITIES; MONETARY POLICIES AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS; AND THE HEALTH OF THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES.

RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD HAVE INCREASED THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE FIRM WILL OPERATE. ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED IN THE U.S., SUCH AS TAX REFORM OR INCREASED EXPENDITURE ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, COULD LEAD TO HIGHER LEVELS OF U.S. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND MORE EXPANSIVE U.S. DOMESTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH, OTHERS, SUCH AS PROTECTIONIST TRADE POLICIES OR ISOLATIONIST FOREIGN POLICIES, COULD CONTRACT ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE MANNER AND EXTENT TO WHICH THESE ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE ULTIMATELY ENACTED COULD IMPACT MARKET VOLATILITY AND AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH THEIR IMPACT ON THE BUSINESSES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM’S CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS REFERENDA IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE VOTE BY THE U.K. ELECTORATE TO LEAVE THE EU, AS WELL AS THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF EUROZONE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN 2017, HAVE TRIGGERED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE EUROZONE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH UNCERTAINTY, AND ANY RESULTANT MARKET VOLATILITY, WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM

EXECUTES FOR ITS CLIENTS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES, AS WELL AS THE WILLINGNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITIES, CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS; INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT SPREADS; AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, POLITICAL EVENTS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT HAVING BEEN APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

THE FIRM MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECLINING ASSET VALUES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR BUSINESSES THAT EARN FEES FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS OR RECEIVE OR POST COLLATERAL. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE CLIENT ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S REVENUE FROM FEES THAT ARE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OR CUSTODY. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS, AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS (SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENTLY-ADOPTED SEC RULES RELATING TO MONEY-MARKET FUNDS), MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRM’S FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS OR CAUSE CLIENTS TO INVEST FUNDS IN PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LOWER REVENUE.

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET AND THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM EARNS FROM NET INTEREST INCOME. AN INCREASING OR HIGH INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, WHILE GENERALLY INCREASING THE NET INTEREST INCOME EARNED BY THE FIRM, MAY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO RESULT IN LOWER LEVELS OF COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND DIMINISHED RETURNS ON THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO (TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REINVEST CONTEMPORANEOUSLY IN HIGHER-YIELDING ASSETS), THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE FIRM’S REVENUES AND CAPITAL LEVELS. CONVERSELY, A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT MAY COMPRESS NET INTEREST MARGINS, REDUCING THE AMOUNTS THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR REDUCING THE VALUE OF ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSRS”) ASSET, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER REVENUES.

THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY U.S. DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST

11

PART I

RATES, THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, HOUSING PRICES, THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. SUSTAINED LOW GROWTH IN THE U.S. ECONOMY COULD DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC DISLOCATIONS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES DUE TO HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT RESULTING FROM DECLINING INDUSTRIAL OR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY, OR OTHER MARKET OR ECONOMIC FACTORS, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD, AUTO, STUDENT AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE FIRM’S EARNINGS. THE FIRM’S EARNINGS FROM ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT AFFECT CONSUMERS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO MEDICAL INSURANCE, IMMIGRATION, EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND TAXATION, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AIMED AT THE ECONOMY MORE BROADLY, SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND GLOBAL TRADE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER INFLATION OR REDUCTIONS IN CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME.

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE FIRM TO BORROW ON BOTH A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS, AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN OR NARROW NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO FIRM-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS AND CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS WILL IMPACT, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FIRM’S EARNINGS ON CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS (INCLUDING LOANS AND DERIVATIVES) MAY CURTAIL THE TRADING MARKETS FOR SUCH SECURITIES AND ASSETS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SELL OR HEDGE SUCH SECURITIES AND ASSETS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S PROFITABILITY, CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY, OR INCREASE THE FIRM’S FUNDING COSTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS RECENTLY OBSERVED THAT MARKET VOLATILITY MAY BE EXACERBATED BY REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE VOLCKER RULE ARE LIKELY TO DECREASE THEIR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND THEREBY CONSTRAIN MARKET LIQUIDITY, DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. IN ADDITION, IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OR WIDESPREAD MARKET DISLOCATIONS. SUSTAINED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT CONSUMER OR INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY AND DECREASED REVENUE FOR THE FIRM.

CREDIT RISK

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, PARTICULARLY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUNDS, INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE CREDIT RISK OF ITS COUNTERPARTIES AND, IN SOME CASES, DISPUTES AND LITIGATION IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT. DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES MAY ALSO ARISE REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OF UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, OPERATIONAL, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, OR RESULT IN CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

THE FAILURE OF A SIGNIFICANT MARKET PARTICIPANT, OR CONCERNS ABOUT A DEFAULT BY SUCH AN INSTITUTION, COULD ALSO LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR, OR LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY, OTHER INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM. IN ADDITION, IN RECENT YEARS THE PERCEIVED INTERRELATIONSHIP AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAS ALSO LED TO CLAIMS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND REGULATORS THAT THE FIRM AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALLEGEDLY VIOLATED ANTI-TRUST OR ANTI-COMPETITION LAWS BY COLLUDING TO MANIPULATE MARKETS, PRICES OR INDICES, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH ALLEGATIONS WILL NOT ARISE IN THE SAME OR SIMILAR CONTEXTS IN THE FUTURE.

AS PART OF PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF A NUMBER OF CCPS, AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF OTHER MEMBERS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER, THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS, WHICH IT SEEKS TO MITIGATE THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE COLLATERAL. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM CAN BE EXPOSED TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF ITS CLIENTS IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING CASH MANAGEMENT, CLEARING, CUSTODIAL AND OTHER TRANSACTION SERVICES TO SUCH CLIENTS. IF A CLIENT FOR WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDES SUCH SERVICES BECOMES BANKRUPT OR INSOLVENT, THE FIRM MAY SUFFER LOSSES, BECOME INVOLVED IN DISPUTES AND LITIGATION WITH VARIOUS PARTIES, INCLUDING ONE OR MORE CCPS, OR THE CLIENT’S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE AND OTHER CREDITORS, OR INVOLVED IN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS. ALL OF SUCH EVENTS CAN INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND LITIGATION COSTS AND MAY RESULT IN LOSSES IF ANY COLLATERAL RECEIVED BY THE FIRM IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER SUCH LOSSES.

DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS OR ILLIQUIDITY, THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE FIRM CANNOT REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT OR WHEN COLLATERAL IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO THE FIRM. FURTHER, DISPUTES WITH OBLIGORS CONCERNING THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL COULD INCREASE IN

12

TIMES OF SIGNIFICANT MARKET STRESS, VOLATILITY OR ILLIQUIDITY, AND THE FIRM COULD SUFFER LOSSES DURING SUCH PERIODS IF IT IS UNABLE TO REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CLIENTS OR COUNTERPARTIES ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF THE FIRM’S BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES IN SIMILAR, RELATED OR DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES AND THEREBY COULD EXACERBATE THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE AND POTENTIALLY INCREASE ITS LOSSES, INCLUDING MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES IN ITS TRADING BUSINESSES. SIMILARLY, CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECTING A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM’S BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES, NOT ONLY IN THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHY BUT IN RELATED OR DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES, WHEREVER LOCATED, OR ABOUT THE ABILITY OF CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES LIVING IN SUCH AREAS OR WORKING IN SUCH AFFECTED INDUSTRIES OR RELATED OR DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION OR CONTAGION RISKS, THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE ITS EXPOSURES AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRM’S INABILITY TO SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE THE VALUE OF ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRM’S POSITIONS MAY NOT ONLY INCREASE THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT MAY ALSO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (“RWA”) ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE OTHERWISE EXPERIENCING DISRUPTION, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (“SPES”) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN SELLING OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, DEFAULT BY A CCP OR OTHER COUNTERPARTY, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND

RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS) DURING THAT TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE SEVERE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IF THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO STABLE AND LOW COST SOURCES OF FUNDING, SUCH AS BANK DEPOSITS, IS REDUCED, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO RAISE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING WHICH MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE OR OF LIMITED AVAILABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDING COULD BE AFFECTED BY ACTIONS THAT THE FIRM MAY TAKE IN ORDER TO SATISFY APPLICABLE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO AND NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO REQUIREMENTS, TO LOWER ITS GSIB SYSTEMIC RISK SCORE, TO SATISFY THE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE LTD THAT THE FIRM MUST HAVE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TLAC RULES, TO ADDRESS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN OR TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS RELATING TO THE PRE-POSITIONING OF LIQUIDITY IN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND DEPENDS ON THE CASH FLOWS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS EQUITY SECURITIES, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS DEBT SECURITIES AND REDEMPTIONS AND REPURCHASES OF ITS OUTSTANDING SECURITIES.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS DEPENDENT ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE HOLDINGS LLC (THE “IHC”), AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IHC THE STOCK OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS DIRECT SUBSIDIARIES (OTHER THAN JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.) AS WELL AS OTHER ASSETS AND INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS OWING TO IT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS OBLIGATED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IHC SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE NET PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY IT FROM SECURITIES ISSUANCES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ISSUANCES OF SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES AND OF PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK). AS A RESULT OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S ABILITY TO PAY INTEREST ON ITS DEBT SECURITIES AND DIVIDENDS ON ITS EQUITY SECURITIES, TO REDEEM OR REPURCHASE ITS OUTSTANDING SECURITIES AND TO FULFILL ITS OTHER PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON IT RECEIVING DIVIDENDS FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND DIVIDENDS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT FROM THE IHC. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON ITS DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS, CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LIQUIDITY COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., AND THE IHC IS PROHIBITED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS OR EXTENDING CREDIT TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IF CERTAIN CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY “THRESHOLDS” ARE BREACHED OR IF LIMITS ARE OTHERWISE IMPOSED BY THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THESE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS PERMITTED TO RECEIVE FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE IHC COULD REDUCE OR HINDER ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, OR RESULT IN JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. SEEKING PROTECTION UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS AT A TIME EARLIER THAN

13

PART I

WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE ABSENT THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH THRESHOLDS.

REDUCTIONS IN JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT RATINGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY AND COST OF FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OF ITS PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE CURRENTLY RATED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. RATING AGENCIES EVALUATE BOTH GENERAL AND FIRM- AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING THEIR CREDIT RATINGS FOR A PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, FUTURE PROFITABILITY, RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, LEGAL EXPENSES, ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, AND RATINGS DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES, TO THE EXTENT IT IS ABLE, FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT ANY SUCH DOWNGRADE WOULD NOT OCCUR AT TIMES OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY WHEN THE FIRM’S OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS MAY BE MORE LIMITED AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

FURTHERMORE, A REDUCTION IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING SECURITIES, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY CURTAILING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCH REDUCTION IN CREDIT RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT SPREADS CHARGED BY THE MARKET FOR TAKING CREDIT RISK ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE ISSUED OR MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE.

LEGAL RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES. ACTIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, AND AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES EXAMINE THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ON BOTH A ROUTINE- AND TARGETED-EXAM BASIS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE

THAT THEY WILL NOT PURSUE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM IN THE FUTURE. A VIOLATION OF LAW OR REGULATION BY ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS LIKELY TO GIVE RISE TO AN INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR PRACTICES BY THE FIRM. FOR EXAMPLE, VARIOUS REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES HAVE MADE INQUIRIES TO THE FIRM ABOUT ITS SALES PRACTICES WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, THE FIRM’S INCENTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURES RELATED TO SUCH PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A SINGLE EVENT MAY GIVE RISE TO NUMEROUS AND OVERLAPPING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, EITHER BY MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE AND OTHER INITIATIVES FROM U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND OFFICIALS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FURTHER JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES, OR CAUSE THE FIRM TO BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES OR TO CEASE OFFERING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH COULD HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR LEAD TO HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S PROFITABILITY, OR RESULT IN COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

OTHER BUSINESS RISKS

ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE BY THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OR TRENDS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, TO MAKE PRUDENT DECISIONS REGARDING THE FIRM’S STRATEGY OR TO EXECUTE ON THAT STRATEGY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S COMPETITIVE STANDING AND ITS EARNINGS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM OPERATES IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AND OFFERS A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM’S STRATEGIES CONCERNING THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT IT WILL OFFER, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH IT WILL OPERATE, THE TYPES OF CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS THAT IT WILL SERVE AND THE COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT WILL DO BUSINESS, AND THE METHODS AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS BY WHICH IT WILL OFFER ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WILL ALL AFFECT THE FIRM’S COMPETITIVE STANDING AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IF THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT MAKES CHOICES ABOUT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND GOALS THAT LATER PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, DOES NOT ACCURATELY ASSESS THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AND THE INDUSTRY TRENDS AFFECTING THE FIRM OR DOES NOT FORMULATE EFFECTIVE BUSINESS PLANS TO ADDRESS THE FIRM’S NEAR- AND LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC PRIORITIES, AS WELL AS THE CHANGING REGULATORY AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD, THE FRANCHISE VALUES AND  GROWTH PROSPECTS OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES WILL SUFFER AND REVENUES WILL DECLINE. THE PROSPECTS OF THE FIRM WILL ALSO DEPEND ON MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO EXECUTE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THE FIRM’S STRATEGIC PLANS AND TO MANAGE THE FIRM’S RESOURCES TO GROW REVENUES, CONTROL EXPENSES AND RETURN CAPITAL TO THE FIRM’S SHAREHOLDERS. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO EXERCISE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENT’S STRATEGIC DECISIONS, OR ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE BY THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE ON THE FIRM’S STRATEGIC PLANS AND BUSINESS INITIATIVES, OR THE INEFFECTUAL

14

IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS DECISIONS, THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR DEALINGS WITH CUSTOMERS TO MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, INADEQUATE RESPONSES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE FAILURE TO REACT QUICKLY TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS OR STRUCTURE, OR THE FAILURE TO DEVELOP THE NECESSARY OPERATIONAL, TECHNOLOGY, RISK, FINANCIAL, AND MANAGERIAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO GROW AND MANAGE THE FIRM AND ITS VARIOUS BUSINESSES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S COMPETITIVE STANDING AND NEGATIVELY  AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE U.S. AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE U.S. AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS “PEGGING” THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THEIR CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCIES OF OTHERS) ARE BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND CONSEQUENTLY, UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND MARKET-MAKING IN SECURITIES, LOANS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM SLOWING GROWTH RATES OR RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OR THE RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, IN THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH SUCH COMPANIES OPERATE, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS AND CONSIDERATIONS AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATION RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS, CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS OR REPUDIATE TRANSACTIONS AUTHORIZED BY A PREVIOUS INCUMBENT GOVERNMENT, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THOSE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS. IN SOME CASES, CONCERNS REGARDING THE FISCAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES CAN CAUSE A CONTRACTION OF AVAILABLE CREDIT AND REDUCED ACTIVITY AMONG TRADING PARTNERS OR CREATE MARKET VOLATILITY THAT COULD LEAD TO “MARKET CONTAGION” AFFECTING OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE SAME REGION OR BEYOND THE

REGION. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OR ITS CLIENT DO BUSINESS MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT PROTECTIONIST ECONOMIC OR TRADE POLICIES IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH COULD LEAD TO DIMINISHED CROSS-BORDER TRADE AND FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THAT COUNTRY OR REGION, ALL OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND EARNINGS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CAN ALSO UNDERMINE CONSUMER, BUSINESS AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TO MARKET VOLATILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, UNCERTAINTIES CONCERNING THE TIMING AND TERMS OF THE U.K.’S PLANNED DEPARTURE FROM THE EU COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MORE GENERALLY. FURTHERMORE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS AGREED BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN BUSINESS IN THE EU FROM LEGAL ENTITIES ORGANIZED IN OR OPERATING FROM THE U.K., IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER SOME SCENARIOS, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO ITS LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS AND THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN A LESS EFFICIENT OPERATING MODEL ACROSS THE FIRM’S EUROPEAN LEGAL ENTITIES. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS OR ENGAGES IN ONLY LIMITED ACTIVITIES, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THE FIRM MUST COMPLY WITH ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND EMBARGO PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY OFAC AND SIMILAR MULTI-NATIONAL BODIES AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OUTSIDE U.S., INCLUDING, MOST RECENTLY, SANCTIONS TARGETED AT INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES IN RUSSIA. A VIOLATION OF A SANCTION OR EMBARGO PROGRAM COULD SUBJECT THE FIRM, AND INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, TO REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATIONS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY BE HINDERED BY LOCAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS.

SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES HAVE ECONOMIES OR MARKETS THAT ARE LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE VOLATILE, AND MAY HAVE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE LESS ESTABLISHED OR PREDICTABLE, THAN THE U.S. AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS IN WHICH THE FIRM CURRENTLY OPERATES. SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, OR DEFAULTS OR POTENTIAL DEFAULTS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS, OR HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICIES SUCH AS CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THESE COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, HAVE RECENTLY BEEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS; THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO, SOCIAL UNREST,

15

PART I

GENERAL STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, CRIME AND CORRUPTION, SECURITY AND PERSONAL SAFETY ISSUES, OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES, OVERTHROW OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER FORMS OF INTERNAL DISCORD, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRIES. POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OR DISLOCATION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES CAN HINDER THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THOSE OPERATIONS.

LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES CAN ALSO HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY BASIS OR GUIDANCE FOR ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS OR TRANSACTIONS; THE PROMULGATION OF CONFLICTING OR AMBIGUOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OR INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; DIFFICULTY IN COMPETING IN ECONOMIES IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS OR PROTECTS ALL OR A PORTION OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY OR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES, OR WHERE GRAFT OR CORRUPTION MAY BE PERVASIVE; AND THE THREAT OF ARBITRARY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, CIVIL LITIGATIONS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS, THE TERMINATION OF LICENSES REQUIRED TO OPERATE IN THE LOCAL MARKET OR THE SUSPENSION OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENTAL BODIES.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS INCLUDING MONETARY POLICIES, EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN AFFECT, AND IN THE PAST CONDITIONS OF THESE TYPES HAVE AFFECTED, THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THE U.S. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES OFTEN REQUIRES THE FIRM TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UNDERSTANDING, AND MONITORING CHANGES IN, LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING RELATED INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL ALWAYS BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS PREDICTABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM CAN ALSO INCUR HIGHER COSTS, AND FACE GREATER COMPLIANCE RISKS, IN STRUCTURING AND OPERATING ITS BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO COMPLY WITH U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND INTEGRITY OF ITS PROCESSES, OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND EMPLOYEES, AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES OF SUCH PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, OR ERRORS OR MISCONDUCT BY SUCH EMPLOYEES, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR AN INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS AND TO DO SO ON A FASTER AND MORE FREQUENT BASIS. THE FIRM’S FRONT- AND BACK-OFFICE TRADING SYSTEMS SIMILARLY RELY ON THEIR ACCESS TO, AND ON THE FUNCTIONALITY OF, THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS MAINTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS CLEARING AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS, CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES, SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND DATA PROCESSING AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. IF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, TRADING OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS, OR THE OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OF THIRD PARTIES ON WHICH THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT, ARE UNABLE TO MEET THESE INCREASINGLY DEMANDING STANDARDS, OR IF THEY FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. MOREOVER, AS THE SPEED, FREQUENCY, VOLUME AND COMPLEXITY OF TRANSACTIONS (AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ON A REAL-TIME BASIS TO CLIENTS, REGULATORS AND FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES) INCREASES, THE RISK OF HUMAN AND/OR SYSTEMS ERROR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCREASES, AND IT BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING TO MAINTAIN THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE COMPETENCE AND RELIABILITY OF ITS EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYEES OF THIRD PARTIES ON WHOM THE FIRM RELIES FOR TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT, AND THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE CAUSED BY HUMAN ERROR OR MISCONDUCT BY AN EMPLOYEE OF THE FIRM OR A THIRD PARTY. IN ADDITION, WHEN THE FIRM CHANGES PROCESSES OR INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR NEW CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, IMPAIRMENT OF LIQUIDITY, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, INCLUDING RETAILERS, DATA AGGREGATORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS DO BUSINESS, CAN ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, PARTICULARLY WHERE ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMERS OR SUCH THIRD PARTIES ARE BEYOND THE FIRM’S SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THROUGH THE USE OF THE INTERNET, PERSONAL SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES OR SERVICES. AS THE FIRM’S INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES INCREASES, THE FIRM INCREASINGLY FACES THE RISK OF OPERATIONAL FAILURE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SYSTEMS. SECURITY BREACHES AFFECTING THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS, OR SYSTEMS BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES, SECURITY BREACHES OR HUMAN ERROR OR MISCONDUCT AFFECTING SUCH OTHER THIRD

16

PARTIES, MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OWN OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR TO SAFEGUARD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR ITS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY INCREASING THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DIMINISHING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. FURTHERMORE, THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, AND THE INCREASED IMPORTANCE OF THESE ENTITIES, INCREASES THE RISK THAT AN OPERATIONAL FAILURE AT ONE INSTITUTION OR ENTITY MAY CAUSE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OPERATIONAL FAILURE THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX AND EVOLVING U.S. AND NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE PRIVACY AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF INDIVIDUALS (INCLUDING CLIENTS, CLIENT’S CLIENTS, EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRM AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES). ENSURING THAT THE FIRM’S COLLECTION, USE, TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING WHERE THE LAWS OF DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ARE IN CONFLICT, CAN INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATING COSTS, IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT BY MANAGEMENT, AND MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO STRUCTURE ITS BUSINESSES, OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS IN LESS EFFICIENT WAYS. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF ITS CLIENTS, SUPPLIERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM AND THE FIRM, PARTICULARLY WHERE SUCH INFORMATION IS TRANSMITTED BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED (IN SITUATIONS WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE COMPROMISED BY THIRD PARTIES), THE FIRM COULD BE EXPOSED TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY SANCTIONS. CONCERNS REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR EVEN THE PERCEPTION THAT SUCH MEASURES ARE INADEQUATE, COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THEREBY REDUCE THE FIRM’S REVENUES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE BY THE FIRM TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY SUBJECT IT TO INQUIRIES, EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN REQUIREMENTS TO MODIFY OR CEASE CERTAIN OPERATIONS OR PRACTICES OR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES, FINES OR PENALTIES, AND COULD DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY BREACHES (AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW); ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES; FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER-SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES OR TERRORIST ACTS. JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE

THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS, INCLUDING STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESILIENCY PLANS ARE BOTH SUFFICIENT AND ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PLANS WILL FULLY MITIGATE ALL POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS TO THE FIRM OR ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS. ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SUBJECTING THE FIRM TO LOSSES OR LIABILITY, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE FAILURE OR DISRUPTION, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

A BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SYSTEMS, OR THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, COULD DISRUPT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND LEGAL EXPOSURE FOR THE FIRM.

ALTHOUGH JPMORGAN CHASE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPGRADE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION BELONGING TO THE FIRM AND ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES WILL PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER COMPANIES, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF THEIR WEBSITES, NETWORKS OR OTHER SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE INVOLVED SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED ATTACKS INTENDED TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE, INCLUDING THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALWARE, CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER MEANS. THE FIRM IS REGULARLY TARGETED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES USING MALICIOUS CODE AND VIRUSES, AND HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH WERE INTENDED TO DISRUPT ONLINE BANKING SERVICES.

DESPITE THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF ITS SYSTEMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE, DETECT OR RECOGNIZE THREATS TO ITS SYSTEMS OR TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES OF THESE TYPES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE FIRM, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE CYBERATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE OR MAY BE INVOLVED IN ORGANIZED CRIME OR LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND SUCH THIRD PARTIES MAY SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS EITHER DIRECTLY OR USING EQUIPMENT OR SECURITY PASSWORDS BELONGING TO EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER USERS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS MOBILE-PAYMENT AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND

17

PART I

EXPANDS ITS INTERNAL USAGE OF WEB-BASED PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS.

GIVEN THE BREADTH OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, THE HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT IT PROCESSES, THE LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, COUNTERPARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AND THE PROLIFERATION AND INCREASING SOPHISTICATION OF CYBERATTACKS, A PARTICULAR CYBERATTACK COULD OCCUR AND PERSIST FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE BEING DETECTED. THE EXTENT OF A PARTICULAR CYBERATTACK AND THE STEPS THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO TAKE TO INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY CLEAR, AND IT MAY TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE SUCH AN INVESTIGATION COULD BE COMPLETED AND FULL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ATTACK IS KNOWN. DURING SUCH TIME THE FIRM MAY NOT NECESSARILY KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE HARM OR HOW BEST TO REMEDIATE IT, AND CERTAIN ERRORS OR ACTIONS COULD BE REPEATED OR COMPOUNDED BEFORE THEY ARE DISCOVERED AND REMEDIATED, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD FURTHER INCREASE THE COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF A CYBERATTACK.

A SUCCESSFUL PENETRATION OR CIRCUMVENTION OF THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS OR THE SYSTEMS OF ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRM, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR THAT OF ITS CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, COUNTERPARTIES OR EMPLOYEES, OR DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS OR SYSTEMS OF THE FIRM AND THOSE OF ITS CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE FIRM OR TO ITS CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION EXPOSURE AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

RISK MANAGEMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS AND ITS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING EVERY RISK TO THE FIRM, THEREBY RESULTING IN LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM RELIES ON DATA TO AGGREGATE AND ASSESS ITS VARIOUS RISK EXPOSURES, AND ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE QUALITY OR EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S DATA AGGREGATION AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES COULD RESULT IN INEFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OR INACCURATE RISK REPORTING. ANY LAPSE IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR OTHER INADEQUACIES IN THE DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE, PROCEDURES, PRACTICES, MODELS OR RISK REPORTING SYSTEMS COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE FIRM, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE ANY RISK MANAGEMENT DEFICIENCY, ATTRACT HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

THE FIRM ESTABLISHES ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURES, AND ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S TRADING TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

MANY OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OR TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT’S SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, INCLUDING DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENTS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED AND COULD AGAIN LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES.

MANY OF THE MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW NOT ONLY BY THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK FUNCTION BUT ALSO BY THE FIRM’S REGULATORS IN ORDER THAT THE FIRM MAY UTILIZE SUCH MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S CALCULATIONS OF MARKET RISK RWA, CREDIT RISK RWA AND OPERATIONAL RISK RWA UNDER BASEL III. THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER CAPITAL CHARGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS OR LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESSES, IF SUCH MODELS DO NOT RECEIVE APPROVAL BY ITS REGULATORS.

18

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MUST COMPLY WITH ENHANCED STANDARDS FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE FIRM. THESE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THE FIRM BOTH UNDER GENERAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY ITS BANKING REGULATORS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, UNDER CERTAIN OF THE CONSENT ORDERS TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS BEEN SUBJECT. THE FIRM HAS INCURRED AND EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSIGHT OF ITS THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. FAILURE BY THE FIRM TO APPROPRIATELY ASSESS AND MANAGE THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT BANKING FUNCTIONS, SHARED SERVICES OR OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES, COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS IMPOSED BY THE FIRM’S REGULATORS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

OTHER RISKS

ACTIONS OR INACTION BY EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRM MAY CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM’S CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FIRM’S CULTURE AND LEAD TO LIABILITY AND REGULATORY AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EMPLOYEES INTERACT WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES EVERY DAY, AND THEY ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THEIR CONDUCT TO DEMONSTRATE THE FIRM’S VALUES AND EXHIBIT THE CULTURE AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FIRM’S HOW WE DO BUSINESS PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S COMMITMENT TO “DO FIRST CLASS BUSINESS IN A FIRST CLASS WAY”. IF AN EMPLOYEE TAKES AN ACTION (INCLUDING A FAILURE TO ACT) THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE FIRM’S CODE OF CONDUCT, IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S HOW WE DO BUSINESS PRINCIPLES OR THAT OTHERWISE HARMS CLIENTS, CONSUMERS OR THE MARKET, SUCH AS IMPROPERLY SELLING AND MARKETING THE FIRM’S PRODUCT OR SERVICES, ACTING ILLEGALLY WITH OTHERS TO ESTABLISH MARKET PRICES, IMPROPERLY HIRING INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO “POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS” OR MISAPPROPRIATING FIRM PROPERTY OR CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR TECHNOLOGY BELONGING TO THE FIRM, ITS CUSTOMERS OR THIRD PARTIES, SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AND JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES, AND LEAD TO REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH COULD HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR RESULT IN COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM ENDEAVORS TO EMBED CULTURE AND CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT AN EMPLOYEE’S LIFE CYCLE, INCLUDING RECRUITING, ONBOARDING, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT, AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE FIRM’S PROMOTION AND COMPENSATION PROCESSES, EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRM HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST, ENGAGED IN IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT RESULTING IN LITIGATION AS WELL AS SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING CONSENT ORDERS, DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENTS AND NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SETTLEMENTS WITH REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FURTHER INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS BY EMPLOYEES WILL NOT OCCUR OR

THAT ANY SUCH ACTIONS WILL ALWAYS BE DETERRED OR QUICKLY PREVENTED.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT COMPETITION IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE INTENSE. COMPETITORS OF THE FIRM INCLUDE OTHER BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, TRADING, ADVISORY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS, FINANCE COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND OTHER FIRMS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN PROVIDING SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING, PAYMENT PROCESSING AND ONLINE AUTOMATED ALGORITHMIC-BASED INVESTMENT ADVICE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE REQUIRED AND COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO SPEND MORE TO MODIFY OR ADAPT ITS PRODUCTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS OR TO MATCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY ITS COMPETITORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION, ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION, PRICE OR OTHER FACTORS, MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES AND FEES FOR THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE OF ANY OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, WHETHER DUE TO GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR UNDERPERFORMANCE (RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS OR TO BENCHMARKS), COULD IMPACT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO RETAIN CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS OR ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S REVENUES. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES, OR TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NON-U.S. COMPETITORS OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, CAN PUT THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO ITS NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING THE FIRM FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, IMPOSING HIGHER CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON THE FIRM, MAKING THE FIRM’S PRICING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE FIRM’S COST STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE THE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

19

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO ITS SUCCESS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRM’S MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE FIRM ENDEAVORS TO ATTRACT TALENTED AND DIVERSE NEW EMPLOYEES AND RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE U.S., AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IMMIGRATION POLICIES WERE TO UNDULY RESTRICT OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES TO WORK IN, OR TRANSFER AMONG, JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS OPERATIONS OR CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS, THE FIRM COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM ALSO SEEKS TO RETAIN A PIPELINE OF SENIOR EMPLOYEES WITH SUPERIOR TALENT, AUGMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME BY EXTERNAL HIRES, TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF SUCCESSION FOR THE FIRM’S OPERATING COMMITTEE, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER POSITION, AND SENIOR POSITIONS BELOW THE OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FIRM REGULARLY REVIEWS CANDIDATES FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT POSITIONS TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY CURRENTLY ARE READY FOR A NEXT-LEVEL ROLE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SUCCESSION PLANNING, INCLUDING REVIEW OF THE SUCCESSION PLANS FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE MEMBERS OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE. IF THE FIRM WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING SUCCESSORS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR MEMBERS OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WHICH, IF INCORRECT, COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO USE ESTIMATES AND APPLY JUDGMENTS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INSTRUMENTS IN THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

LAPSES IN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, PROFITABILITY OR REPUTATION.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OR THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL NOT OCCUR. ANY SUCH LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT IT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, SECURITY BREACHES, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. THE FIRM’S REPUTATION COULD ALSO BE HARMED BY THE FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE OF AN AFFILIATE, JOINT-VENTURER OR MERCHANT BANKING PORTFOLIO COMPANY, OR A VENDOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR PROSPECTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED BY ADVERSE PUBLICITY OR NEGATIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, THAT MAY BE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA, NON-MAINSTREAM NEWS SERVICES OR OTHER PARTS OF THE INTERNET, AND THIS RISK CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY THE SPEED AND PERVASIVENESS WITH WHICH INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED THROUGH THOSE CHANNELS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRM’S CLIENTS. THE FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS OR APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST HAS GIVEN RISE TO LITIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. LIKEWISE, THE FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS FAIRLY, TO PROVIDE FIDUCIARY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, OR TO HANDLE OR USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS APPROPRIATELY OR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAS GIVEN RISE TO LITIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IN THE FUTURE, A FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY  ADDRESS CONFLICTS OR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST

20

REVENUE AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION.

ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS DURING AND AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR THAT A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAD ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY WITH RESPECT TO THE METHODS EMPLOYED IN OFFERING PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, HAVE DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OCCUR, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING RISE TO THE DAMAGE TO ITS REPUTATION COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR THAT DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION WILL NOT IMPAIR THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO RETAIN ITS EXISTING OR ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. SEE “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING” ON

PAGE 139.

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE. SEE EXHIBITS 31.1 AND 31.2 FOR THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROL IN THE FUTURE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING” ON

SUMMARY OF 2016 RESULTS

JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTED STRONG RESULTS FOR FULL YEAR 2016 WITH NET INCOME OF $24.7 BILLION, OR $6.19 PER SHARE, ON NET REVENUE OF $95.7 BILLION. THE FIRM REPORTED ROE OF 10% AND ROTCE OF 13%.

NET INCOME INCREASED 1% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND HIGHER NET REVENUE, PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 2% PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME ACROSS ALL THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND HIGHER MARKETS NONINTEREST REVENUE IN CIB, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CARD INCOME IN CCB AND LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AWM.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $55.8 BILLION, DOWN 5% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER LEGAL EXPENSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $5.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.5 BILLION, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL CONSUMER PROVISION RELATED TO ADDITIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, AND A LOWER BENEFIT IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO DRIVEN BY A LOWER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION HAD A MODEST INCREASE, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF DOWNGRADES IN THE OIL & GAS AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES PORTFOLIOS.

THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $14.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND THE FIRM HAD A LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO, EXCLUDING THE PCI PORTFOLIO, OF 1.34%, COMPARED WITH 1.37% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE FIRM’S NONPERFORMING ASSETS TOTALED $7.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR LEVEL OF $7.0 BILLION.

FIRMWIDE AVERAGE CORE LOANS INCREASED 15% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

WITHIN CCB, AVERAGE CORE LOANS INCREASED 20% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. CCB HAD RECORD GROWTH IN AVERAGE DEPOSITS, WITH A 10% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. CREDIT CARD SALES VOLUME INCREASED 10%, AND MERCHANT PROCESSING VOLUME INCREASED 12%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. CCB HAD NEARLY 27 MILLION ACTIVE MOBILE CUSTOMERS AT YEAR-END 2016, AN INCREASE OF 16% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

CIB MAINTAINED ITS #1 RANKING FOR GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WITH A 8.1% WALLET SHARE FOR THE FULL-YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. WITHIN CB, RECORD AVERAGE LOANS INCREASED 14% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS LOANS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CLIENT SEGMENT INCREASED 9% AND LOANS IN THE WHOLESALE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE CLIENT SEGMENT INCREASED 18%. AWM HAD RECORD AVERAGE LOANS, AN INCREASE OF 5% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, AND 79% OF AWM’S MUTUAL FUND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT RANKED IN THE 1ST OR 2ND QUARTILES OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS.

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY LINE OF BUSINESS (“LOB”), REFER TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 51–52.

THE FIRM ADDED TO ITS CAPITAL, ENDING THE FULL-YEAR OF 2016 WITH A TBVPS OF $51.44, UP 7% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THE FIRM’S ESTIMATED BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN CET1 CAPITAL AND RATIO WERE $182 BILLION AND 12.2%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FULLY PHASED-IN SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (“SLR”) FOR THE FIRM AND FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. WAS 6.5% AND 6.6%, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE FIRM ALSO WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE FULLY PHASED-IN U.S. LCR AND HAD $524 BILLION OF HQLA AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE LCR AND HQLA, SEE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 110–115.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE. THE FIRM PROVIDED CREDIT AND RAISED CAPITAL OF $2.4 TRILLION FOR COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER CLIENTS DURING THE FULL-YEAR OF 2016.

•

$265 BILLION OF CREDIT FOR CONSUMERS

•

$24 BILLION OF CREDIT FOR U.S. SMALL BUSINESSES

•

$772 BILLION OF CREDIT FOR CORPORATIONS

•

$1.2 TRILLION OF CAPITAL RAISED FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES

•

$90 BILLION OF CREDIT AND CAPITAL RAISED FOR NONPROFIT AND U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, INCLUDING STATES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES

ON OCTOBER 1, 2016, THE FIRM FILED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS SUBMISSION (THE “2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION”) DESCRIBING HOW THE FIRM REMEDIATED CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES, AND PROVIDING A STATUS REPORT ON ITS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS, THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC IN APRIL 2016 WHEN THOSE AGENCIES PROVIDED FEEDBACK TO THE FIRM AS WELL AS TO SEVEN OTHER SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT DOMESTIC BANKING INSTITUTIONS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE 2015 RESOLUTION PLANS.

AMONG THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE FIRM TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES AND SHORTCOMINGS WERE: (I) ESTABLISHING A NEW SUBSIDIARY THAT HAS BECOME AN “INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY” AND TO WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. HAS CONTRIBUTED THE STOCK OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS DIRECT SUBSIDIARIES (OTHER THAN JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), AS WELL AS OTHER ASSETS AND INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS OWING TO JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.; (II) INCREASING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RESERVES AND PRE-POSITIONING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY AT THE FIRM’S “MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITIES” (AS DEFINED IN THE 2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION); (III) REFINING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A FIRMWIDE “TRIGGER FRAMEWORK” THAT IDENTIFIES KEY ACTIONS AND ESCALATIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE TAKEN, AS WELL AS DECISIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE, AT CRITICAL POINTS IN TIME IF CERTAIN DEFINED LIQUIDITY AND/OR CAPITAL METRICS WERE TO FALL BELOW DEFINED THRESHOLDS; (IV) ESTABLISHING CLEAR, ACTIONABLE LEGAL ENTITY RATIONALIZATION CRITERIA AND RELATED GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES; AND (V) IMPROVING DIVESTITURE READINESS, INCLUDING DETERMINING AND ANALYZING DIVESTITURE OPTIONS IN A CRISIS. ON DECEMBER 13, 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC INFORMED THE FIRM THAT THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE FIRM’S 2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION ADEQUATELY REMEDIATED THE IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIRM’S 2015 RESOLUTION PLAN. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND FDIC WEBSITES, AND THE FIRM’S WEBSITE FOR THE PUBLIC PORTION OF THE 2016 RESOLUTION SUBMISSION.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THESE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE THE FIRM’S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SEE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ON

PAGE 138

AND THE RISK FACTORS SECTION ON

PAGES 8–21.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2017 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S. ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, THE GEOPOLITICAL

ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. EACH OF THESE INTER-RELATED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY, AS WELL AS BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS NET INTEREST INCOME TO INCREASE MODESTLY COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016. DURING 2017, ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2016, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS NET INTEREST INCOME COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2016, REFLECTING THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S RATE INCREASE IN DECEMBER 2016 AND EXPECTED LOAN GROWTH. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS AVERAGE CORE LOAN GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 10% IN 2017.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE CHARGE-OFF RATES AT OR NEAR HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS, REFLECTING FAVORABLE CREDIT TRENDS ACROSS THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS TOTAL NET CHARGE-OFFS OF APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION IN 2017. IN CARD, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE PORTFOLIO AVERAGE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE TO INCREASE IN 2017, BUT REMAIN BELOW 3.00%, REFLECTING CONTINUED LOAN GROWTH AND THE SEASONING OF NEWER VINTAGES, WITH QUARTERLY NET-CHARGE OFFS REFLECTING NORMAL SEASONAL TRENDS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN 2017, REFLECTING GROWTH ACROSS BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO. EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE RELATED TO THE OIL & GAS AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES AND METALS & MINING PORTFOLIOS, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COULD INCREASE MODESTLY IN 2017 REFLECTING GROWTH ACROSS BUSINESSES. CONTINUED STABILITY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS. AS MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY LOOKS TO ENHANCE ITS CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES, THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ANY SUCH POTENTIAL REFINEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO TAKE A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO MANAGING ITS EXPENSES, WHILE INVESTING IN GROWTH AND INNOVATION. AS A RESULT, FIRMWIDE ADJUSTED EXPENSE IN 2017 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $58 BILLION (EXCLUDING FIRMWIDE LEGAL EXPENSE).

IN CCB, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS MORTGAGE NONINTEREST REVENUE TO DECREASE APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION IN 2017, DRIVEN BY MARGIN COMPRESSION IN A SMALLER MORTGAGE MARKET AND CONTINUED RUN-OFF OF THE SERVICING PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION OF MSR GAINS IN 2016 WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RECUR IN 2017. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CARD SERVICES NONINTEREST REVENUE TO DECREASE APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN 2017, REFLECTING THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON STRONG NEW PRODUCT ORIGINATIONS AND THE ABSENCE IN 2017 OF A GAIN ON THE SALE OF VISA EUROPE INTERESTS IN 2016, ALTHOUGH TOTAL CARD SERVICES REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO STRONG GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CCB EXPENSE TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER.

IN CIB, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY IN LINE WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016, DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING OF THE CLOSING OF A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS. TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY EXPECTS MARKETS REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017 TO INCREASE MODESTLY COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WITH RESULTS SENSITIVE TO MARKET CONDITIONS IN MARCH IN LIGHT OF PARTICULARLY STRONG REVENUE IN MARCH 2016. IN SECURITIES SERVICES, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017.

IN CB, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $775 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017.

IN AWM, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS REVENUE TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 2% PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME ACROSS ALL THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND HIGHER MARKETS NONINTEREST REVENUE IN CIB, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CARD INCOME IN CCB AND LOWER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AWM.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN INDUSTRY-WIDE FEE LEVELS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, SEE CIB SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 58–62

AND NOTE 7.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE INCREASED REFLECTING BROAD-BASED STRENGTH ACROSS PRODUCTS IN CIB’S FIXED INCOME MARKETS BUSINESS. RATES PERFORMANCE WAS STRONG, WITH INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY DRIVEN BY HIGH ISSUANCE-BASED FLOWS, GLOBAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, AND CENTRAL BANK ACTIONS.

AND NOTE 7.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY REFLECTING.

▪

HIGHER OPERATING LEASE INCOME FROM GROWTH IN AUTO OPERATING LEASE ASSETS IN CCB

▪

A GAIN ON THE SALE OF VISA EUROPE INTERESTS IN CCB

▪

A GAIN RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES (“TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

”

)

▪

THE ABSENCE OF LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN 2015 RELATED TO THE ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF CERTAIN NON-OPERATING DEPOSITS

▪

A GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF AN ASSET IN AWM AT THE BEGINNING OF 2016

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

▪

A $514 MILLION BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM A LEGAL SETTLEMENT IN CORPORATE.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OTHER INCOME, SEE NOTE 7.

NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOAN GROWTH ACROSS THE BUSINESSES AND THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT SECURITIES BALANCES AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. THE FIRM’S AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE $2.1 TRILLION IN 2016, AND THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT (“FTE

”

) BASIS, WAS 2.25%, AN INCREASE OF 11 BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2015 COMPARED WITH 2014

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2015 WAS DOWN BY 2%, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LOWER CORPORATE PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, LOWER CIB REVENUE REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVES, AND LOWER CCB MORTGAGE BANKING REVENUE. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT FROM A LEGAL SETTLEMENT IN CORPORATE, AND HIGHER OPERATING LEASE INCOME, PREDOMINANTLY IN CCB.

40

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES INCREASED REFLECTING HIGHER ADVISORY FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES. THE INCREASE IN ADVISORY FEES WAS DRIVEN BY A GREATER SHARE OF FEES FOR COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN INDUSTRY-WIDE FEE LEVELS. THE DECREASE IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES RESULTED FROM LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE ISSUANCE, AND THE DECREASE IN DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER LOAN SYNDICATION AND BOND UNDERWRITING FEES ON LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE FEE LEVELS.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECREASED REFLECTING LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN CORPORATE DRIVEN BY LOWER VALUATION GAINS AND LOWER NET GAINS ON SALES AS THE FIRM EXITS THIS NON-CORE BUSINESS. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING REVENUE, PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS IN CIB, AS WELL AS A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION ON CCB’S INVESTMENT IN SQUARE, INC. UPON ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE DECREASED LARGELY AS A RESULT OF LOWER FEES IN CIB AND LOWER PERFORMANCE FEES IN AWM. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES AS A RESULT OF NET CLIENT INFLOWS INTO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE MARKET LEVELS IN AWM AND CCB.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME DECREASED REFLECTING LOWER SERVICING REVENUE, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED, AND LOWER NET PRODUCTION REVENUE REFLECTING A LOWER REPURCHASE BENEFIT.

OTHER INCOME WAS RELATIVELY FLAT REFLECTING A $514 MILLION BENEFIT FROM A LEGAL SETTLEMENT IN CORPORATE, HIGHER OPERATING LEASE INCOME AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN AUTO OPERATING LEASE ASSETS IN CCB, AND THE ABSENCE OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE EXIT OF NON-CORE PORTFOLIOS IN CARD. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION IN CIB; THE ABSENCE OF A BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN 2014 FROM A FRANCHISE TAX SETTLEMENT; AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT OF CERTAIN NON-OPERATING DEPOSITS.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AS LOWER LOAN YIELDS, LOWER INVESTMENT SECURITIES NET INTEREST INCOME, AND LOWER TRADING ASSET BALANCE AND YIELDS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES AND LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEPOSITS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL CONSUMER PROVISION AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE WHOLESALE PROVISION. THE INCREASE IN THE TOTAL CONSUMER PROVISION WAS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY.

▪

A $920 MILLION INCREASE RELATED TO THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, DUE TO A $600 MILLION ADDITION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AS WELL AS $320 MILLION OF HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, DRIVEN BY LOAN GROWTH (INCLUDING GROWTH IN NEWER VINTAGES WHICH, AS ANTICIPATED, HAVE HIGHER LOSS RATES COMPARED TO THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO), AND

▪

A $470 MILLION LOWER BENEFIT RELATED TO THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, AS THE CURRENT YEAR REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE REDUCTION IN BOTH PERIODS REFLECTED CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN HOME PRICES AND LOWER DELINQUENCIES.

THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF DOWNGRADES IN THE OIL & GAS AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES PORTFOLIOS. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS OF CCB ON

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION, LARGELY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF DOWNGRADES IN THE OIL & GAS PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION, REFLECTING LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS DUE TO CONTINUED DISCIPLINE IN CREDIT UNDERWRITING, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY DRIVEN BY INCREASING HOME PRICES AND LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS. THE DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED EXPENSE REDUCTION INITIATIVES, INCLUDING LOWER HEADCOUNT IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED AS A RESULT OF LOWER LEGAL EXPENSE (INCLUDING LOWER LEGAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSE), THE IMPACT OF EFFICIENCIES, AND REDUCED NON-U.S. TAX SURCHARGES. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FROM GROWTH IN AUTO OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN MARKETING.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY 4% AS A RESULT OF LOWER CIB EXPENSE, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION; AND LOWER CCB EXPENSE RESULTING FROM EFFICIENCIES RELATED TO DECLINES IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE AND LOWER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTROLS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES AND REDUCED HEADCOUNT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS AND INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTROLS.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED REFLECTING BENEFITS FROM BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION IN CIB; LOWER PROFESSIONAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSE, REFLECTING LOWER LEGAL SERVICES EXPENSE AND A REDUCED NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS IN THE BUSINESSES; LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES; AND THE ABSENCE OF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN CORPORATE. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER AUTO OPERATING LEASE ASSETS IN CCB; HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE IN CCB; AND HIGHER FDIC-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. LEGAL EXPENSE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

THESE TAX BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM TAX AUDITS. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2015 WAS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY $2.9 BILLION OF TAX BENEFITS, WHICH REDUCED THE FIRM’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 9.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RECOGNITION OF TAX BENEFITS IN 2015 RESULTED FROM THE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS TAX AUDITS, AS WELL AS THE RELEASE OF U.S. DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. ENTITIES.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DEPOSIT GROWTH IN EXCESS OF LOAN GROWTH. THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH IS PLACED WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PREDOMINANTLY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER DEMAND FOR SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB, AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE

DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB. THE INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS REFLECTED HIGHER DEBT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY INSTRUMENT INVENTORY LEVELS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND. THE INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF CLIENT-DRIVEN SHORT POSITIONS IN BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WAS PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB. THE INCREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF MARKET MOVEMENTS, WHICH INCREASED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RECEIVABLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES.

AND

12.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE INCREASE IN LOANS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS. THE INCREASE IN CONSUMER LOANS WAS DUE TO RETENTION OF ORIGINATED HIGH-QUALITY PRIME MORTGAGES IN CCB AND AWM, AND GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD AND AUTO LOANS IN CCB. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE LOANS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY  ORIGINATIONS OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IN CB AND COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES IN CB AND CIB.

THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADDITIONS TO THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE DRIVEN BY DOWNGRADES IN THE OIL & GAS AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES PORTFOLIOS. THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE WAS FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND REFLECTED REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND DELINQUENCIES, AND DUE TO RUNOFF IN THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO; THESE FACTORS WERE OFFSET BY ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOAN GROWTH IN THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO (INCLUDING NEWER VINTAGES WHICH, AS ANTICIPATED, HAVE HIGHER LOSS RATES COMPARED TO THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO), AS WELL AS DUE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED ON-BALANCE SHEET, WHILE OTHERS ARE OFF-BALANCE SHEET UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF–BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGH NONCONSOLIDATED SPES, WHICH ARE A TYPE OF VIE, AND THROUGH LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS AN SPE. SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-B

A

CKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, AS THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS’ ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SPES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE TYPES OF SPES.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARM’S LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRM’S CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY “P-1”, “A-1” AND “F1” FOR MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE (“MOODY’S”), STANDARD & POOR’S AND FITCH,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS SUPPORT THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER BY FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED SPES. IN THE EVENT OF A SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ABSENT OTHER SOLUTIONS, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE SPE IF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER COULD NOT BE REISSUED AS IT MATURED. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING HELD BY THIRD PARTIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, WAS

$2.7 BILLION

AND

$8.7 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THESE SPES COULD INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD CLIENTS OF THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED SPES DRAW DOWN ON CERTAIN UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE

$7.4 BILLION

AND

$5.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE REFINANCING OF SOME OF THE CLIENTS’ ASSETS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FUNDING OBLIGATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IN NOTE 16.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTS AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. THE FIRM’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER AND ANY CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. SEE NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES ARE REFINANCED, EXTENDED, CANCELLED, OR EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ON

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRM’S LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE. OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND ITS CAPACITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SECURED AND UNSECURED SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE FIRM’S OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 REFLECTED NET INCOME AFTER NONCASH OPERATING ADJUSTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2016 CASH PROVIDED REFLECTED INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND TRADING LIABILITIES RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB. THE INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF CLIENT-DRIVEN SHORT POSITIONS IN BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. CASH USED IN 2016 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM MERCHANTS IN CCB AND HIGHER CLIENT RECEIVABLES RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES IN CIB; AND HIGHER NET ORIGINATIONS AND PURCHASES FROM LOAN HELD-FOR-SALE ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS REFLECTED HIGHER DEBT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY INSTRUMENT INVENTORY LEVELS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND. CASH PROVIDED IN 2015 RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB, RESULTING IN LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROVIDED REFLECTED A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO LOWER CLIENT RECEIVABLES AND HIGHER NET PROCEEDS FROM LOAN SALES ACTIVITIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, RESULTING FROM LOWER BROKERAGE CUSTOMER PAYABLES RELATED TO CLIENT ACTIVITY IN CIB. IN 2014, CASH PROVIDED REFLECTED HIGHER NET PROCEEDS FROM LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND SALES ACTIVITIES.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE ORIGINATING LOANS FOR INVESTMENT, DEPOSITING CASH AT BANKS, AND INVESTING IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2016 RESULTED FROM NET ORIGINATIONS OF CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS. THE INCREASE IN CONSUMER LOANS WAS DUE TO RETENTION OF ORIGINATED HIGH-QUALITY PRIME

MORTGAGES IN CCB AND AWM, AND GROWTH OF CREDIT CARD AND AUTO LOANS IN CCB. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE LOANS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY ORIGINATIONS OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IN CB AND COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES IN CB AND CIB. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2016, CASH OUTFLOWS REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN DEPOSITS IN EXCESS OF GROWTH IN LOANS; AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS DUE TO HIGHER DEMAND FOR SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY AND CIO. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING 2015 PREDOMINANTLY RESULTED FROM LOWER DEPOSITS WITH BANKS DUE TO THE FIRM’S ACTIONS TO REDUCE WHOLESALE NON-OPERATING DEPOSITS; AND NET PROCEEDS FROM PAYDOWNS, MATURITIES, SALES AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE NET INFLOWS WAS CASH USED FOR NET ORIGINATIONS OF CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS, A PORTION OF WHICH REFLECTED A SHIFT FROM INVESTMENT SECURITIES. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING 2014 RESULTED FROM INCREASES IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF EXCESS FUNDS; CASH WAS ALSO USED FOR GROWTH IN WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS IN 2014. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH OUTFLOWS IN 2014 WAS A NET DECLINE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY AND CIO. INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2014 ALSO REFLECTED NET PROCEEDS FROM PAYDOWNS, MATURITIES, SALES AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES ACQUIRING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT, AS WELL AS PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2016 RESULTED FROM HIGHER CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS, AND AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB. CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2015 RESULTED FROM LOWER WHOLESALE DEPOSITS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CONSUMER DEPOSITS. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2015 CASH OUTFLOWS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER LEVELS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER DUE TO THE DISCONTINUATION OF A CASH MANAGEMENT PRODUCT THAT OFFERED CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF SWEEPING THEIR DEPOSITS INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER; LOWER COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS; AND A DECREASE IN SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DUE TO A DECLINE IN SECURED FINANCINGS. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2014 PREDOMINANTLY RESULTED FROM HIGHER CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS. FOR ALL PERIODS, CASH WAS PROVIDED BY NET PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM BORROWINGS; AND CASH WAS USED FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING U.S. GAAP; THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON

PAGES 141–145

. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS “REPORTED” BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRM’S RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES’ U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRM’S RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRM’S RESULTS, INCLUDING THE OVERHEAD RATIO, AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS, ON A “MANAGED” BASIS, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FIRM (AND EACH OF THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS) ON AN FTE BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT

RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE OR BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE FIRM AND BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE FIRM OR OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AND, THEREFORE, FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM OR THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS RELEVANT COMPETITORS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ON

PAGES 51–70.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS AND RATIOS DISCLOSED BY THE FIRM EXCLUDE PCI LOANS, AND ARE THEREFORE NON-GAAP MEASURES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, SEE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 86–107.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE FIRM MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

NET INTEREST INCOME EXCLUDING CIB’S MARKETS BUSINESSES

IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING NET INTEREST INCOME ON A MANAGED BASIS, MANAGEMENT ALSO REVIEWS NET INTEREST INCOME EXCLUDING NET INTEREST INCOME ARISING FROM CIB’S MARKETS BUSINESSES TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM’S LENDING, INVESTING (INCLUDING ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT) AND DEPOSIT-RAISING ACTIVITIES. CIB’S MARKETS BUSINESSES REPRESENT BOTH FIXED INCOME MARKETS AND EQUITY MARKETS. THE DATA PRESENTED BELOW ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF NET INTEREST INCOME FROM CIB’S MARKETS BUSINESSES (“CIB MARKETS”).

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS EXCLUSION PROVIDES INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS WITH ANOTHER MEASURE BY WHICH TO ANALYZE THE NON-MARKETS-RELATED BUSINESS TRENDS OF THE FIRM AND PROVIDES A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON LENDING, INVESTING AND DEPOSIT-RAISING ACTIVITIES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY, ROTCE AND TBVPS

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (“TCE”), ROTCE AND TBVPS ARE EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TCE REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (I.E., TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK) LESS GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN MSRS), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ROTCE MEASURES THE FIRM’S NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON EQUITY AS A PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TCE. TBVPS REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S TCE AT PERIOD-END DIVIDED BY COMMON SHARES AT PERIOD-END. TCE, ROTCE, AND TBVPS ARE UTILIZED BY THE FIRM, AS WELL AS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS, IN ASSESSING THE FIRM’S USE OF EQUITY.

KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL, RWA, AND CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT ARE PRESENTED UNDER BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RULES AND THE FIRM’S, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.’S SLRS CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RULES ARE CONSIDERED KEY REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES. SUCH MEASURES ARE USED BY BANKING REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS THE FIRM’S REGULATORY CAPITAL POSITION AND TO COMPARE THE FIRM’S REGULATORY CAPITAL TO THAT OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE MEASURES, SEE CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 76–85.

CORE LOANS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED A KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. CORE LOANS REPRESENT LOANS CONSIDERED CENTRAL TO THE FIRM’S ONGOING BUSINESSES; AND EXCLUDE LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, RUNOFF PORTFOLIOS, DISCONTINUED PORTFOLIOS AND PORTFOLIOS THE FIRM HAS AN INTENT TO EXIT. CORE LOANS ARE UTILIZED BY THE FIRM AND ITS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS IN ASSESSING ACTUAL GROWTH IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS BASIS. THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS – CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING, CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT (FORMERLY ASSET MANAGEMENT). IN ADDITION, THERE IS A CORPORATE SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER

SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ON

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS INCLUDES THE ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THE FIRM ALSO ASSESSES THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT LINE OF BUSINESS CAPITAL, SEE LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON

PAGE 83.

THE FIRM PERIODICALLY ASSESSES THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRM’S CLIENTS, THE PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND TO TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY RISK EXPOSURES TO TREASURY AND CIO WITHIN CORPORATE. THE FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING PROCESS CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY

SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (“ALCO”).

DEBT EXPENSE AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDEND ALLOCATION

AS PART OF THE FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING PROCESS, LARGELY ALL OF THE COST OF THE CREDIT SPREAD COMPONENT OF OUTSTANDING UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS IS ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, WHILE THE BALANCE OF THE COST IS RETAINED IN CORPORATE. THE METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE THE COST OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDEND TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS ALIGNED WITH THE FIRM’S PROCESS TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL. THE ALLOCATED COST OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT IS INCLUDED IN A BUSINESS SEGMENT’S NET INTEREST INCOME, AND NET INCOME IS REDUCED BY PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS TO ARRIVE AT A BUSINESS SEGMENT’S NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON EQUITY.

BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION CHANGES

THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS COMMON EQUITY. ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE FIRM ASSESSES THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGIES USED TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL. THROUGH THE END OF 2016, CAPITAL WAS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS BASED ON A SINGLE MEASURE, BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017, THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY USED TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS WAS UPDATED. THE NEW METHODOLOGY INCORPORATES BASEL III STANDARDIZED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA (AS WELL AS BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA), LEVERAGE, THE GSIB SURCHARGE, AND A SIMULATION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

51

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL IN A SEVERE STRESS ENVIRONMENT. THE METHODOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHTED TOWARDS BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA BECAUSE THE FIRM BELIEVES IT TO BE THE BEST PROXY FOR ECONOMIC RISK. THE FIRM WILL CONSIDER FURTHER CHANGES TO ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK EVOLVES. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE NEW METHODOLOGY, CAPITAL IS NO LONGER ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CORPORATE SUPPORT UNITS, OR ANOTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT, THE COSTS OF THOSE SERVICES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS GENERALLY

ALLOCATED BASED ON ACTUAL COST AND USE OF SERVICES PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER COSTS RELATED TO CORPORATE SUPPORT UNITS, OR TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. EXPENSE RETAINED IN CORPORATE GENERALLY INCLUDES PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CORPORATE SUPPORT UNITS; AND OTHER ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH A PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2016 COMPARED WITH 2015

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING NET INCOME WAS $9.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 1% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE.

NET REVENUE WAS $44.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 2% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $29.7 BILLION, UP 5%, DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES AND HIGHER LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DEPOSIT SPREAD COMPRESSION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST AND FEES IN CREDIT CARD. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $15.3 BILLION, DOWN 2%, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATION COSTS AND THE IMPACT OF RENEGOTIATED CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS IN CREDIT CARD AND LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE PREDOMINANTLY AS A RESULT OF A LOWER LEVEL OF THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED; THESE FACTORS WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AUTO LEASE AND CARD SALES VOLUME, HIGHER CARD- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, HIGHER MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF VISA EUROPE INTERESTS. SEE NOTE 17 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET AND RELATED HEDGES, AND MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

NET REVENUE WAS $43.8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 1% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $1.0 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND LOWER DELINQUENCIES AS WELL AS INCREASED GRANULARITY IN THE IMPAIRMENT ESTIMATES IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AND RUNOFF IN THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $1.3 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND LOWER DELINQUENCIES IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, A DECREASE IN THE CREDIT CARD ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM INCREASED GRANULARITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT ESTIMATES AND LOWER BALANCES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS MODIFIED IN TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (“TDRS”), RUNOFF IN THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES IN AUTO LOANS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $24.9 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE AND LOWER PROFESSIONAL FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AUTO LEASE DEPRECIATION.

•

PERCENTAGE OF MUTUAL FUND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN FUNDS RATED 4- OR 5-STAR.

MUTUAL FUND RATING SERVICES RANK FUNDS BASED ON THEIR RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS. A 5-STAR RATING IS THE BEST RATING AND REPRESENTS THE TOP 10% OF INDUSTRY-WIDE RANKED FUNDS. A 4-STAR RATING REPRESENTS THE NEXT 22.5% OF INDUSTRY-WIDE RANKED FUNDS. A 3-STAR RATING REPRESENTS THE NEXT 35% OF INDUSTRY-WIDE RANKED FUNDS. A 2-STAR RATING REPRESENTS THE NEXT 22.5% OF INDUSTRY-WIDE RANKED FUNDS. A 1-STAR RATING IS THE WORST RATING AND REPRESENTS THE BOTTOM 10% OF INDUSTRY-WIDE RANKED FUNDS. THE

“

OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING

”

IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH A FUND’S THREE-, FIVE- AND TEN-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. FOR U.S. DOMICILED FUNDS, SEPARATE STAR RATINGS ARE GIVEN AT THE INDIVIDUAL SHARE CLASS LEVEL. THE NOMURA

“

STAR RATING

”

IS BASED ON THREE-YEAR RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE ONLY. FUNDS WITH FEWER THAN THREE YEARS OF HISTORY ARE NOT RATED AND HENCE EXCLUDED FROM THIS ANALYSIS. ALL RATINGS, THE ASSIGNED PEER CATEGORIES AND THE ASSET VALUES USED TO DERIVE THIS ANALYSIS ARE SOURCED FROM THESE FUND RATING PROVIDERS MENTIONED IN FOOTNOTE (A). THE DATA PROVIDERS RE-DENOMINATE THE ASSET VALUES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THIS % OF AUM IS BASED ON STAR RATINGS AT THE SHARE CLASS LEVEL FOR U.S. DOMICILED FUNDS, AND AT A

“

PRIMARY SHARE CLASS

”

LEVEL TO REPRESENT THE STAR RATING OF ALL OTHER FUNDS EXCEPT FOR JAPAN WHERE NOMURA PROVIDES RATINGS AT THE FUND LEVEL. THE “PRIMARY SHARE CLASS”, AS DEFINED BY MORNINGSTAR, DENOTES THE SHARE CLASS RECOMMENDED AS BEING THE BEST PROXY FOR THE PORTFOLIO AND IN MOST CASES WILL BE THE MOST RETAIL VERSION (BASED UPON ANNUAL MANAGEMENT CHARGE, MINIMUM INVESTMENT, CURRENCY AND OTHER FACTORS). THE PERFORMANCE DATA COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF ALL FUNDS/ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

•

PERCENTAGE OF MUTUAL FUND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN FUNDS RANKED IN THE 1ST OR 2ND QUARTILE (ONE, THREE AND FIVE YEARS)

: ALL QUARTILE RANKINGS, THE ASSIGNED PEER CATEGORIES AND THE ASSET VALUES USED TO DERIVE THIS ANALYSIS ARE SOURCED FROM THE FUND RANKING PROVIDERS MENTIONED IN FOOTNOTE (B). QUARTILE RANKINGS ARE DONE ON THE NET-OF-FEE ABSOLUTE RETURN OF EACH FUND. THE DATA PROVIDERS RE-DENOMINATE THE ASSET VALUES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THIS % OF AUM IS BASED ON FUND PERFORMANCE AND ASSOCIATED PEER RANKINGS AT THE SHARE CLASS LEVEL FOR U.S. DOMICILED FUNDS, AT A

“

PRIMARY SHARE CLASS” LEVEL TO REPRESENT THE QUARTILE RANKING OF

THE

U.K., LUXEMBOURG AND HONG KONG FUNDS AND AT THE FUND LEVEL FOR ALL OTHER FUNDS. THE

“

PRIMARY SHARE CLASS

”

, AS DEFINED BY MORNINGSTAR, DENOTES THE SHARE CLASS RECOMMENDED AS BEING THE BEST PROXY FOR THE PORTFOLIO AND IN MOST CASES WILL BE THE MOST RETAIL VERSION (BASED UPON ANNUAL MANAGEMENT CHARGE, MINIMUM INVESTMENT, CURRENCY AND OTHER FACTORS). WHERE PEER GROUP RANKINGS GIVEN FOR A FUND ARE IN MORE THAN ONE “PRIMARY SHARE CLASS” TERRITORY BOTH RANKINGS ARE INCLUDED TO REFLECT LOCAL MARKET COMPETITIVENESS (APPLIES TO “OFFSHORE TERRITORIES” AND “HK SFC AUTHORIZED” FUNDS ONLY). THE PERFORMANCE DATA COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF ALL FUNDS/ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WHEN THE FIRM EXTENDS A CONSUMER OR WHOLESALE

LOAN, ADVISES CUSTOMERS ON THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS, MAKES MARKETS IN SECURITIES, OR OFFERS OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE FIRM TAKES ON SOME DEGREE OF RISK. THE FIRM’S OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESSES, AND THE ASSOCIATED RISKS, IN A MANNER THAT BALANCES SERVING THE INTERESTS OF ITS CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS AND PROTECTS THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE FIRM.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN AND MANAGED ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE BASIS. THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT COVERS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER CORE RISK AREAS, SUCH AS CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY, MODEL, PRINCIPAL, COUNTRY, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT, LEGAL, CAPITAL AND REPUTATION RISK, WITH CONTROLS AND GOVERNANCE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH AREA, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES.

•

ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION AND ESCALATION OF RISK ISSUES, BY ALL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE FIRM;

•

OWNERSHIP OF RISK IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, DATA AND MANAGEMENT WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS; AND

•

FIRMWIDE STRUCTURES FOR RISK GOVERNANCE.

THE FIRM’S OPERATING COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE FIRM’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”), CHIEF RISK OFFICER (“CRO”), CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (“COO”), CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (“CFO”) AND OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES, IS THE ULTIMATE MANAGEMENT ESCALATION POINT IN THE FIRM, AND MAY REFER MATTERS TO THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE OPERATING COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE FIRM STRIVES FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT THROUGH EFFORTS TO ENHANCE CONTROLS, ONGOING EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT, TALENT RETENTION, AND OTHER MEASURES. THE FIRM FOLLOWS A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED COMPENSATION FRAMEWORK WITH STRONG INTERNAL GOVERNANCE AND INDEPENDENT BOARD OVERSIGHT. THE IMPACT OF RISK AND CONTROL ISSUES ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROCESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

THE FIRM’S OVERALL APPETITE FOR RISK IS GOVERNED BY A “RISK APPETITE” FRAMEWORK. THE FRAMEWORK AND THE FIRM’S RISK APPETITE ARE SET AND APPROVED BY THE FIRM’S CEO, CFO, CRO AND COO. LOB-LEVEL RISK APPETITE IS SET BY THE RESPECTIVE LOB CEO, CFO AND CRO AND IS APPROVED BY THE FIRM’S CEO, CFO, CRO AND COO. QUANTITATIVE PARAMETERS AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE USED TO MONITOR AND MEASURE THE FIRM’S CAPACITY TO TAKE RISK AGAINST STATED RISK APPETITE. QUANTITATIVE PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO ASSESS STRESSED NET INCOME, CAPITAL, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY RISK. QUALITATIVE FACTORS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR SELECT RISKS. RISK APPETITE RESULTS ARE REPORTED QUARTERLY TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ RISK POLICY COMMITTEE (“DRPC”).

THE FIRM’S CRO IS THE HEAD OF THE INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT (“IRM”) FUNCTION AND REPORTS TO THE CEO AND THE DRPC. THE CEO APPOINTS THE CRO TO CREATE THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE DRPC IN THE FORM OF THE PRIMARY RISK POLICIES. THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER (“CCO”), WHO REPORTS TO THE CRO, IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR THE GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. THE FIRM’S GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON OVERSEEING COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

THE IRM FUNCTION, COMPRISED OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE ORGANIZATIONS, IS INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES. THE IRM FUNCTION SETS VARIOUS STANDARDS FOR THE RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING RISK POLICY, IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, ASSESSMENT, TESTING, LIMIT SETTING (E.G., RISK APPETITE, THRESHOLDS, ETC.), MONITORING AND REPORTING. VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN THE IRM FUNCTION ARE ALIGNED TO THE LOBS AND TO CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, REGIONS AND CORE AREAS OF RISK SUCH AS CREDIT, MARKET, COUNTRY AND LIQUIDITY RISKS, AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL, MODEL AND REPUTATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE.

THE FIRM PLACES KEY RELIANCE ON EACH OF ITS LOBS AND OTHER FUNCTIONAL AREAS GIVING RISE TO RISK. EACH LOB OR OTHER FUNCTIONAL AREA GIVING RISE TO RISK IS EXPECTED TO OPERATE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE PARAMETERS IDENTIFIED BY THE IRM FUNCTION, AND WITHIN THEIR OWN MANAGEMENT-IDENTIFIED RISK AND CONTROL STANDARDS. BECAUSE THESE LOBS AND FUNCTIONAL AREAS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING THE RISKS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND FOR OPERATING WITHIN A SOUND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, THEY ARE CONSIDERED THE “FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE” WITHIN THE FIRM’S RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK.

THE FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP CONSISTS OF DEDICATED CONTROL OFFICERS WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS HAVING A CENTRAL OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. THE GROUP IS CHARGED WITH ENHANCING THE FIRM’S CONTROL ENVIRONMENT BY LOOKING WITHIN AND ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS TO HELP IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE CONTROL ISSUES. THE GROUP ENABLES THE FIRM TO DETECT CONTROL PROBLEMS MORE QUICKLY, ESCALATE ISSUES PROMPTLY AND ENGAGE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND COMMON THEMES AND INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FIRM.

AS THE “SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE”, THE IRM FUNCTION PROVIDES OVERSIGHT AND INDEPENDENT CHALLENGE, CONSISTENT WITH ITS POLICIES AND FRAMEWORK, TO THE RISK-CREATING LOBS AND FUNCTIONAL AREAS.

INTERNAL AUDIT, A FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES

AND THE IRM FUNCTION, TESTS AND EVALUATES THE FIRM’S RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS ITS INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES. THIS FUNCTION, THE “THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE” IN THE RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, BRINGS A SYSTEMATIC AND DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO EVALUATING AND IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S GOVERNANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES. THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION IS HEADED BY THE GENERAL AUDITOR, WHO REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE INDEPENDENT STATUS OF THE IRM FUNCTION IS SUPPORTED BY A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES FOR ESCALATION OF RISK ISSUES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE, OR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

CAPITAL RISK IS THE RISK THE FIRM HAS AN INSUFFICIENT LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ASSOCIATED RISKS DURING BOTH NORMAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND UNDER STRESSED CONDITIONS.

A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION.

MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET TO MANAGE THROUGH ECONOMIC VOLATILITY IS CONSIDERED A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE OF THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CEO AND OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, STRONG CAPITAL AND ROBUST LIQUIDITY.

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOCUSES ON MAINTAINING LONG-TERM STABILITY TO ENABLE IT TO BUILD AND INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SENIOR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S EARNINGS OUTLOOK, SENIOR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL WITH A VIEW TO PRESERVING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRENGTH.

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO HOLD CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO.

•

MAINTAIN “WELL-CAPITALIZED” STATUS FOR THE FIRM AND ITS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES;

•

SUPPORT RISKS UNDERLYING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;

•

MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO BUILD AND INVEST IN ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH THE CYCLE AND IN STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS;

•

RETAIN FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES;

•

SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES;

•

MEET CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION OBJECTIVES; AND

•

MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO OPERATE THROUGHOUT A RESOLUTION PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY.

THESE OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MINIMUM CAPITAL TARGETS AND A STRONG CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO REACT TO A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EVENTS. THE FIRM’S MINIMUM CAPITAL TARGETS ARE BASED ON THE MOST BINDING OF THREE PILLARS: AN INTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL NEEDS; AN ESTIMATE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL UNDER THE CCAR AND DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS; AND BASEL III FULLY PHASED-IN REGULATORY MINIMUMS. WHERE NECESSARY, EACH PILLAR MAY INCLUDE A MANAGEMENT-ESTABLISHED BUFFER. THE CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK REQUIRES REGULAR MONITORING OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITIONS, STRESS TESTING AND DEFINING ESCALATION PROTOCOLS, BOTH AT THE FIRM AND MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITY LEVELS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE

THE FIRM’S CEO, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES FOR CAPITAL PLANNING, ISSUANCE, USAGE AND DISTRIBUTIONS, AND MINIMUM CAPITAL TARGETS FOR THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL IN BOTH BUSINESS-AS-USUAL AND HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS. THE DRPC ASSESSES AND APPROVES THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE PROCESSES OF THE FIRM. THE FIRM’S AUDIT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING THE CAPITAL STRESS TESTING END-TO-END CONTROL FRAMEWORK.

THE CAPITAL GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND THE REGULATORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE (“RCMO”) SUPPORT THE FIRM’S STRATEGIC CAPITAL DECISION-MAKING. THE CAPITAL GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE OVERSEES

THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS, INCLUDING THE OVERALL DESIGN, SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT AND MACRO ASSUMPTIONS AND ENSURES THAT CAPITAL STRESS TEST PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. RCMO, WHICH REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CFO, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING AND MONITORING THE FIRM’S EXECUTION OF ITS CAPITAL POLICIES AND STRATEGIES ONCE APPROVED BY THE BOARD, AS WELL AS REVIEWING AND MONITORING THE EXECUTION OF ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE BASEL INDEPENDENT REVIEW FUNCTION (“BIR”), WHICH REPORTS TO THE RCMO AND HAS DIRECT ACCESS TO BOTH THE DRPC AND CAPITAL GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, CONDUCTS INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS OF THE FIRM’S REGULATORY CAPITAL FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE U.S. BASEL RULES IN SUPPORT OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING CAPITAL AND FOR THE DRPC’S OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENT IN EXECUTING THAT RESPONSIBILITY. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE DRPC, SEE ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 71–75.

MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL

IN ITS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION AN ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMIC RISK AND ALL REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL NEEDED TO MEET AND MAINTAIN THE OBJECTIVES DISCUSSED ABOVE, AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT THE FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. WHILE ECONOMIC RISK IS CONSIDERED PRIOR TO MAKING DECISIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, IN MOST CASES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS RISK-BASED REGULATORY CAPITAL TO BE A PROXY FOR ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS, FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FIRM’S NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

THE U.S. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.

BASEL III OVERVIEW

CAPITAL RULES UNDER BASEL III ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS AND OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS FOR LARGE AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS, INCLUDING THE FIRM AND ITS INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION (“IDI”) SUBSIDIARIES.

BASEL III PRESENTS TWO COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING RWA: A GENERAL (STANDARDIZED) APPROACH (“BASEL III STANDARDIZED”), AND AN ADVANCED APPROACH (“BASEL III ADVANCED”). CERTAIN OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF BASEL III ARE SUBJECT TO PHASE-IN PERIODS THAT BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF 2018 (“TRANSITIONAL PERIOD”).

BASEL III ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CALCULATING CREDIT RISK AND MARKET RISK RWA, AND IN THE CASE OF BASEL III ADVANCED, OPERATIONAL RISK RWA. KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE CALCULATION OF CREDIT RISK RWA BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES ARE THAT FOR BASEL III ADVANCED, CREDIT RISK RWA IS BASED ON RISK-SENSITIVE APPROACHES WHICH LARGELY RELY ON THE USE OF INTERNAL CREDIT MODELS AND PARAMETERS, WHEREAS FOR BASEL III STANDARDIZED, CREDIT RISK RWA IS GENERALLY BASED ON SUPERVISORY RISK-WEIGHTINGS WHICH VARY PRIMARILY BY COUNTERPARTY TYPE AND ASSET CLASS. MARKET RISK RWA IS CALCULATED ON A GENERALLY CONSISTENT BASIS BETWEEN BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND BASEL III ADVANCED.

IN ADDITION TO THE RWA CALCULATED UNDER THESE METHODOLOGIES, THE FIRM MAY SUPPLEMENT SUCH AMOUNTS TO INCORPORATE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND FEEDBACK FROM ITS BANK REGULATORS.

BASEL III ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACH BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO CALCULATE

SLR

. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SLR, SEE

PAGE 82.

BASEL III FULLY PHASED-IN

BASEL III CAPITAL RULES WILL BECOME FULLY PHASED-IN ON JANUARY 1, 2019, AT WHICH POINT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO CALCULATE ITS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES. THE FIRM MANAGES EACH OF THE BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS THE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, PRIMARILY ON A BASEL III FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.’S CAPITAL, RWA AND CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RULES AND  SLRS CALCULATED UNDER THE BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RULES, ALL OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED KEY REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES ON

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES OF ITS BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN CAPITAL, RWA AND CAPITAL RATIOS AND SLRS FOR THE FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT PUBLISHED U.S. BASEL III RULES AND ON THE APPLICATION OF SUCH RULES TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED. THE ACTUAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL RATIOS AND SLR AS OF THE

EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE RULES MAY DIFFER FROM THE FIRM’S CURRENT ESTIMATES DEPENDING ON CHANGES THE FIRM MAY MAKE TO ITS BUSINESSES IN THE FUTURE, FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FROM THE REGULATORS, AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MODELS (OR, ALTERNATIVELY, REGULATORY DISAPPROVAL OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MODELS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONDITIONALLY APPROVED).

RISK-BASED CAPITAL REGULATORY MINIMUMS

THE FOLLOWING CHART PRESENTS THE BASEL III MINIMUM CET1 CAPITAL RATIO DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS AND ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS UNDER THE BASEL III RULES CURRENTLY IN EFFECT.

THE BASEL III RULES INCLUDE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PHASE-IN PERIODS THROUGH THE END OF 2018.

THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE FIRM AND ITS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BOTH DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD AND UPON FULL-PHASE IN, IS EVALUATED AGAINST THE BASEL III APPROACH (STANDARDIZED OR ADVANCED) WHICH RESULTS FOR EACH QUARTER IN THE LOWER RATIO AS REQUIRED BY THE COLLINS AMENDMENT

OF THE

DODD-FRANK ACT

(THE “COLLINS FLOOR”). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL RATIOS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. FEDERAL REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT, IS PRESENTED IN NOTE 28. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S BASEL III MEASURES, SEE THE FIRM’S PILLAR 3 REGULATORY CAPITAL DISCLOSURES REPORTS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON THE FIRM’S WEBSITE (HTTP://INVESTOR.SHAREHOLDER.COM/JPMORGANCHASE/BASEL.CFM).

ALL BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO HAVE A MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO OF 4.5% OF CET1 CAPITAL. CERTAIN BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, ARE

REQUIRED TO HOLD ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL TO SERVE AS A “CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER”. THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IS INTENDED TO BE USED TO ABSORB POTENTIAL LOSSES IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL OR ECONOMIC STRESS. IF NOT MAINTAINED,

THE FIRM

COULD BE LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT MAY BE

DISTRIBUTED

, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASES.

THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IS SUBJECT TO A PHASE-IN PERIOD THAT BEGAN JANUARY 1, 2016 AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE END OF 2018.

AS AN EXPANSION OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, THE FIRM IS ALSO REQUIRED TO HOLD ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF CAPITAL IN THE FORM OF A GSIB SURCHARGE AND A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER.

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FINAL RULE, GSIBS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, ARE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THEIR GSIB SURCHARGE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS UNDER TWO SEPARATELY PRESCRIBED METHODS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER OF THE TWO. THE FIRST (“METHOD 1”), REFLECTS THE GSIB SURCHARGE AS PRESCRIBED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE’S ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY, AND IS CALCULATED ACROSS FIVE CRITERIA: SIZE, CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY, INTERCONNECTEDNESS, COMPLEXITY AND SUBSTITUTABILITY. THE SECOND (“METHOD 2”), MODIFIES THE METHOD 1 REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE A MEASURE OF SHORT-TERM WHOLESALE FUNDING IN PLACE OF SUBSTITUTABILITY, AND INTRODUCES A GSIB SCORE “MULTIPLICATION FACTOR”.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

79

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRM’S FULLY PHASED-IN GSIB SURCHARGE FOR 2016 WAS CALCULATED TO BE 2.5% UNDER METHOD 1 AND 4.5% UNDER METHOD 2. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM’S MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS APPLICABLE IN 2016 INCLUDE A GSIB SURCHARGE OF 1.125%, RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS TO THE 4.5% FULLY PHASED-IN GSIB SURCHARGE. FOR 2017, THE FIRM HAS CALCULATED ITS FULLY PHASED-IN GSIB SURCHARGE TO BE 2.5% UNDER METHOD 1 AND 3.5% UNDER METHOD 2 RESULTING IN THE INCLUSION OF A GSIB SURCHARGE OF 1.75% IN THE FIRM’S MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS AFTER APPLICATION OF THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS.

THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE MACRO FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKS FUNCTION. ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED THE FRAMEWORK THAT WILL APPLY TO THE SETTING OF THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER. AS OF OCTOBER 24, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE REAFFIRMED SETTING THE U.S. COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AT 0%, AND STATED THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE AMOUNT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER CAN BE INCREASED IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, FDIC AND OCC DETERMINE THAT CREDIT GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY HAS BECOME EXCESSIVE AND CAN BE SET AT UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 2.5% OF RWA SUBJECT TO A 12-MONTH IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD.

BASED ON THE FIRM’S MOST RECENT ESTIMATE OF ITS GSIB SURCHARGE AND THE CURRENT COUNTERCYCLICAL BUFFER BEING SET AT 0%, THE FIRM ESTIMATES ITS FULLY PHASED-IN CET1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENT, AT JANUARY 1, 2019, WOULD BE 10.5% (REFLECTING THE 4.5% CET1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENT, THE FULLY PHASED-IN 2.5% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER AND THE GSIB SURCHARGE OF 3.5%). AS WELL AS MEETING THE CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS OF BASEL III, THE FIRM MUST, IN ORDER TO BE “WELL-CAPITALIZED”, MAINTAIN A MINIMUM 6% TIER 1 CAPITAL AND A 10% TOTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED BASEL III STANDARDIZED TRANSITIONAL AND BASEL III ADVANCED TRANSITIONAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THE WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, IT WILL OPERATE WITH A BASEL III CET1 CAPITAL RATIO BETWEEN 11% AND 12.5%. IT IS THE FIRM’S INTENTION THAT THE FIRM’S CAPITAL RATIOS CONTINUE TO MEET REGULATORY MINIMUMS AS THEY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN 2019 AND THEREAFTER.

EACH OF THE FIRM’S IDI SUBSIDIARIES

MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM 6.5% CET1, 8% TIER 1 CAPITAL, 10% TOTAL CAPITAL AND 5% TIER 1 LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF “WELL-CAPITALIZED” UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (“PCA”) REQUIREMENTS OF THE FDIC IMPROVEMENT ACT (“FDICIA”)

FOR IDI SUBSIDIARIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRM’S FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS (LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY) IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.

•

INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE AND LINE OF BUSINESS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES;

•

MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND

•

PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER COMPARISONS AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (AS ESTIMATED UNDER BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN). FOR 2016, CAPITAL WAS ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS. ROE IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS KEY MEASURES OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT’S PERFORMANCE.

ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE FIRM ASSESSES THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGIES USED TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL. THROUGH THE END OF 2016, CAPITAL WAS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS BASED ON A SINGLE MEASURE, BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017, THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY USED TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS WAS UPDATED. THE NEW METHODOLOGY INCORPORATES BASEL III STANDARDIZED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA (AS WELL AS BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA), LEVERAGE, THE GSIB SURCHARGE, AND A SIMULATION OF CAPITAL IN A SEVERE STRESS ENVIRONMENT. THE METHODOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO BE WEIGHTED TOWARDS BASEL III ADVANCED FULLY PHASED-IN RWA BECAUSE THE FIRM BELIEVES IT TO BE THE BEST PROXY FOR ECONOMIC RISK. THE FIRM WILL CONSIDER FURTHER CHANGES TO ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK EVOLVES. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE NEW METHODOLOGY, CAPITAL IS NO LONGER ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS.

THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH INTERNAL ROE TARGETS FOR ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AGAINST WHICH THEY WILL BE MEASURED, AS A KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR.

PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW

THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE USES THE CCAR AND DODD-FRANK ACT STRESS TEST PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT LARGE BHCS HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS, AND HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT ADDRESS EACH BHC’S UNIQUE RISKS TO ENABLE THEM TO ABSORB LOSSES UNDER CERTAIN STRESS SCENARIOS.

THROUGH THE CCAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE EVALUATES EACH BHC’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESSES (“ICAAP”), AS WELL AS ITS PLANS TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR STOCK REPURCHASES.

ON JUNE 29, 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INFORMED THE FIRM THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT, ON EITHER A QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE BASIS, TO THE FIRM’S 2016 CAPITAL PLAN. FOR INFORMATION ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOLLOWING THE 2016 CCAR RESULTS, SEE CAPITAL ACTIONS ON PAGE 84.

THE FIRM’S CCAR PROCESS IS INTEGRATED INTO AND EMPLOYS THE SAME METHODOLOGIES UTILIZED IN THE FIRM’S ICAAP PROCESS

, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS

SEMIANNUALLY, THE FIRM COMPLETES THE ICAAP, WHICH PROVIDES MANAGEMENT WITH A VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF SEVERE AND UNEXPECTED EVENTS ON EARNINGS, BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS, RESERVES AND CAPITAL. THE FIRM’S ICAAP INTEGRATES STRESS TESTING PROTOCOLS WITH CAPITAL PLANNING.

THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND CAPITAL. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE KEY DRIVERS OF BUSINESS RESULTS; GLOBAL MARKET SHOCKS, WHICH GENERATE SHORT-TERM BUT SEVERE TRADING LOSSES; AND IDIOSYNCRATIC OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS.

OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

TLAC

ON DECEMBER 15, 2016, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED ITS FINAL TLAC RULE WHICH REQUIRES THE TOP-TIER HOLDING COMPANIES OF EIGHT U.S. GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LEVELS OF EXTERNAL TLAC AND EXTERNAL LONG-TERM DEBT THAT SATISFIES CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (“ELIGIBLE LTD”) BY JANUARY 1, 2019. THE MINIMUM EXTERNAL TLAC REQUIREMENT IS THE GREATER OF (A) 18% OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION’S RWA PLUS APPLICABLE BUFFERS, INCLUDING ITS GSIB SURCHARGE AS CALCULATED UNDER METHOD 1 AND (B) 7.5% OF ITS TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE PLUS A BUFFER EQUAL TO 2.0%. THE REQUIRED MINIMUM LEVEL OF ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT IS EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 6% OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION’S RWA, PLUS ITS U.S. METHOD 2 GSIB SURCHARGE AND (B) 4.5% OF THE FIRM’S TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE. THE FINAL RULE PERMANENTLY GRANDFATHERED ALL LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2016, TO THE EXTENT THESE SECURITIES WOULD BE INELIGIBLE ONLY DUE TO CONTAINING IMPERMISSIBLE ACCELERATION RIGHTS OR BEING GOVERNED BY FOREIGN LAW. WHILE THE FIRM MAY HAVE TO RAISE LONG-TERM DEBT TO BE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE NET AMOUNT TO BE RAISED IS NOT MATERIAL AND THE TIMING FOR RAISING SUCH FUNDS IS MANAGEABLE.

BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM THE DEFAULT OF A CUSTOMER, CLIENT OR COUNTERPARTY. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES.

IN ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS MORTGAGE BANKING, CREDIT CARD, AUTO, BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LENDING BUSINESSES. ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS ARE RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, SECURITIZED OR SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES; OTHER TYPES OF CONSUMER LOANS ARE TYPICALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. IN ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS UNDERWRITING, LENDING, MARKET-MAKING, AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES WITH AND FOR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH ITS OPERATING SERVICES ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES), SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, AND CASH PLACED WITH BANKS. A PORTION OF THE LOANS ORIGINATED OR ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET; THE FIRM’S SYNDICATED LOAN BUSINESS DISTRIBUTES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKET AND IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT MONITORS AND MEASURES CREDIT RISK THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND DEFINES CREDIT RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE CREDIT RISK FUNCTION REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO. THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.

•

ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND EXPOSURE APPROVAL

•

SETTING INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION LIMITS AND ESTABLISHING UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES

•

ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE

•

MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES AND DELINQUENT LOANS

•

ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION MEASURES, LIMITS, MANAGES AND MONITORS CREDIT RISK ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER VERSUS WHOLESALE), RISK MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK-RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT OF AN OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY, THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT AND THE EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CREDIT LOSSES FOR ITS EXPOSURES. PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT LOAN PORTFOLIOS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AND PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL AND REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE ESTABLISHED ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ANALYSES FOR THESE LOSSES INCLUDE STRESS TESTING THAT CONSIDERS ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AS DESCRIBED IN THE STRESS TESTING SECTION BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON

PAGES 132–134.

THE METHODOLOGIES USED TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES DEPEND ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CREDIT EXPOSURE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SCORED EXPOSURE

THE SCORED PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY HELD IN CCB AND PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, CREDIT CARD LOANS, CERTAIN AUTO AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, AND STUDENT LOANS. FOR THE SCORED PORTFOLIO,

CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USES PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING, AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS, WHICH CONSIDER LOAN-LEVEL FACTORS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT SCORES, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

CREDIT LOSS ANALYSES ALSO CONSIDER, AS APPROPRIATE, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. THE FACTORS AND ANALYSIS ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS MARKET CONDITIONS DICTATE.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE GENERALLY HELD IN CIB, CB AND AWM, BUT ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO DEALER LOANS HELD IN CCB THAT ARE RISK-RATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL LOANS. FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIO, CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (“PD”) AND LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT. THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A BORROWER WILL DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION; THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (“LGD”) IS THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON THE LOAN THAT WOULD BE REALIZED UPON THE DEFAULT AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THE ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDES ASSIGNING RISK RATINGS TO EACH BORROWER AND CREDIT FACILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. THESE RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE

86

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

BORROWER’S CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION, RISK PROFILE AND RELATED COLLATERAL. THE CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY.

STRESS TESTING

STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE FIRM. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND THE UNDERLYING PARAMETERS ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY, ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND APPLIED ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THE STRESS TEST RESULTS MAY INDICATE CREDIT MIGRATION, CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND POTENTIAL LOSSES IN THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION TO THE PERIODIC STRESS TESTING PROCESSES, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND COUNTRY- SPECIFIC STRESS SCENARIOS, AS NECESSARY. THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTING TO INFORM DECISIONS ON SETTING RISK APPETITE BOTH AT A FIRM AND LOB LEVEL, AS WELL AS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES.

RISK MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT TO ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN MODELS, ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN EVALUATING AND MONITORING CREDIT RISK ARE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATED BY GROUPS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE LINE OF BUSINESSES.

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED FOR DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS, INCLUDING ANY CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, AS CERTAIN OF THESE TRENDS CAN BE MODIFIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER RISK MANAGEMENT EVALUATES DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS, CURRENT AND FORECASTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED TRENDS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE MODELING OF ESTIMATED CONSUMER CREDIT LOSSES AND ARE PART OF THE MONITORING OF THE CREDIT RISK PROFILE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY AT AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO, INDUSTRY, AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENT AND COUNTERPARTY LEVEL WITH ESTABLISHED CONCENTRATION LIMITS THAT ARE REVIEWED AND REVISED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT, TYPICALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. INDUSTRY AND COUNTERPARTY LIMITS, AS MEASURED IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE AND ECONOMIC RISK APPETITE, ARE SUBJECT TO STRESS-BASED LOSS CONSTRAINTS. IN ADDITION, WRONG-WAY RISK — THE RISK THAT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE IMPACT OF A DEFAULT BY THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, WHICH COULD CAUSE EXPOSURE TO INCREASE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE COUNTERPARTY’S CAPACITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS IS DECREASING — IS ACTIVELY MONITORED AS THIS RISK COULD RESULT IN GREATER EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT COMPARED WITH A TRANSACTION WITH ANOTHER COUNTERPARTY THAT DOES NOT HAVE THIS RISK.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS, INCLUDING.

•

LOAN UNDERWRITING AND CREDIT APPROVAL PROCESS

•

LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS

•

LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

•

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS

•

COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES

IN ADDITION TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT, AN INDEPENDENT CREDIT REVIEW FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

I

NDEPENDENTLY VALIDATING OR CHANGING THE RISK GRADES ASSIGNED TO EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE AND COMMERCIAL-ORIENTED RETAIL CREDIT PORTFOLIOS, AND ASSESSING THE TIMELINESS OF RISK GRADE CHANGES INITIATED BY RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS UNITS; AND

•

EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUSINESS UNITS’ CREDIT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, INCLUDING THE ADEQUACY OF CREDIT ANALYSES AND RISK GRADING/LGD RATIONALES, PROPER MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT EXPOSURES, AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GRADING POLICIES AND UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS, SEE NOTE 14.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT QUALITY FORECASTS, CONCENTRATION LEVELS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR MEMBERS OF CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, RISK COMMITTEES, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS APPROPRIATE.

CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS

CONSUMER LOAN BALANCES INCREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO ORIGINATIONS OF HIGH-QUALITY PRIME MORTGAGE AND AUTO LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYDOWNS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS. THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT REMAINED FAVORABLE AS THE ECONOMY STRENGTHENED AND HOME PRICES INCREASED.

PCI LOANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LOAN PRODUCTS AND ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRM’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT DELINQUENCIES, LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE

NOTE 14.

HOME EQUITY.

THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO DECLINED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOAN PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS. BOTH EARLY-STAGE AND LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES DECLINED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. NONACCRUAL LOANS IMPROVED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND DELINQUENCIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, APPROXIMATELY

90%

OF THE FIRM’S HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (“HELOCS”) AND THE REMAINDER CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LOANS (“HELOANS”). HELOANS ARE GENERALLY FIXED-RATE, CLOSED-END, AMORTIZING LOANS, WITH TERMS RANGING FROM 3–30 YEARS. IN GENERAL, HELOCS ORIGINATED BY THE FIRM ARE REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC RECASTS INTO A LOAN WITH A 20-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD. AT THE TIME OF ORIGINATION, THE BORROWER TYPICALLY SELECTS ONE OF TWO MINIMUM PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN EFFECT DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD: A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF 1% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE, OR INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS BASED ON A VARIABLE INDEX (TYPICALLY PRIME). HELOCS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL WERE GENERALLY REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC CONVERTS TO AN INTEREST-ONLY LOAN WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE END OF THE LOAN’S TERM.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF HELOCS OUTSTANDING WAS

$34 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. OF SUCH AMOUNTS, APPROXIMATELY.

•

$13 BILLION

HAVE RECAST FROM INTEREST-ONLY TO FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS OR HAVE BEEN MODIFIED,

•

$15 BILLION

ARE SCHEDULED TO RECAST FROM INTEREST-ONLY TO FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND

•

$6 BILLION

ARE INTEREST-ONLY BALLOON HELOCS, WHICH PRIMARILY MATURE AFTER 2030.

THE FOLLOWING CHART ILLUSTRATES THE PAYMENT RECAST COMPOSITION OF THE APPROXIMATELY

$21 BILLION

OF HELOCS SCHEDULED TO RECAST IN THE FUTURE, BASED UPON THEIR CURRENT CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

HELOCS SCHEDULED TO RECAST

(AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

)

THE FIRM HAS CONSIDERED THIS PAYMENT RECAST RISK IN ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PAYMENT SHOCK (I.E., THE EXCESS OF THE FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT OVER THE INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT IN EFFECT PRIOR TO RECAST) EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT THE PAYMENT RECAST DATE, ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING ESTIMATED PD AND LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS. AS PART OF ITS ALLOWANCE ESTIMATE, THE FIRM ALSO EXPECTS, BASED ON OBSERVED ACTIVITY IN RECENT YEARS, THAT APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF HELOCS SCHEDULED TO RECAST WILL VOLUNTARILY PREPAY PRIOR TO OR AFTER THE RECAST. THE HELOCS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECAST TO FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES THAN THE HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT SHOCK AT THE TIME OF RECAST. CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND HOME PRICES, COULD ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE LOANS.

THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXHIBITING A MATERIAL DETERIORATION IN THEIR CREDIT RISK PROFILE. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE BOTH THE NEAR-TERM AND LONGER-TERM RECAST RISKS INHERENT IN ITS HELOC PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THAT THE FIRM’S ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE PORTFOLIO’S RISK PROFILE.

90

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

JUNIOR LIEN LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS A SENIOR LIEN LOAN THAT IS EITHER DELINQUENT OR HAS BEEN MODIFIED ARE CONSIDERED HIGH-RISK SECONDS. SUCH LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO POSE A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN JUNIOR LIEN LOANS FOR WHICH THE SENIOR LIEN LOAN IS NEITHER DELINQUENT NOR MODIFIED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM ESTIMATED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION

OF CURRENT JUNIOR LIEN LOANS THAT WERE CONSIDERED HIGH RISK SECONDS, COMPARED WITH

$1.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE BALANCE OF ITS TOTAL EXPOSURE TO HIGH-RISK SECONDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING INTERNAL DATA AND LOAN LEVEL CREDIT BUREAU DATA (WHICH TYPICALLY PROVIDES THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF THE SENIOR LIEN LOAN). THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE INCREASED PD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE HIGH-RISK SECONDS IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CLASSIFIES THOSE LOANS THAT ARE SUBORDINATED TO A FIRST LIEN LOAN THAT IS MORE THAN 90 DAYS DELINQUENT AS NONACCRUAL LOANS. THE ESTIMATED BALANCE OF THESE HIGH-RISK SECONDS MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER FOR REASONS SUCH AS THE MOVEMENT OF RELATED SENIOR LIEN LOANS INTO AND OUT OF THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY BUCKET. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LOANS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 14.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE.

THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO PREDOMINANTLY CONSISTS OF HIGH-QUALITY PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS WITH A SMALL COMPONENT (APPROXIMATELY 2%) OF THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO IN SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS. THESE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS CONTINUE TO RUN-OFF AND ARE PERFORMING IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS. THE RESIDENTIAL  MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

DUE TO RETAINED ORIGINATIONS OF PRIMARILY HIGH-QUALITY FIXED RATE PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYDOWNS. BOTH EARLY-STAGE AND LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. NONACCRUAL LOANS DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

REMAIN LOW, REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES AND DELINQUENCIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, INCLUDED

$9.5 BILLION

AND

$11.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED AND/OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, OF WHICH

$7.0 BILLION

AND

$8.4 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE 30 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE (OF THESE PAST DUE LOANS,

$5.0 BILLION

AND

$6.3 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE). THE FIRM MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN POTENTIAL UNRECOVERABLE CLAIM PAYMENTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT INSURED LOANS AND CONSIDERS THIS EXPOSURE IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO INCLUDED

$19.1 BILLION

AND

$17.8 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF INTEREST-ONLY LOANS. THESE LOANS HAVE AN INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT PERIOD GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE OR FIXED-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING PAYMENT PERIOD TO MATURITY AND ARE TYPICALLY ORIGINATED AS HIGHER-BALANCE LOANS TO HIGHER-INCOME BORROWERS. TO DATE, LOSSES ON THIS PORTFOLIO GENERALLY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE BROADER RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AND THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LOANS.

AUTO.

AUTO LOANS INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN NEW ORIGINATIONS. NONACCRUAL LOANS INCREASED COMPARED WITH

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, PRIMARILY DUE TO DOWNGRADES OF SELECT AUTO DEALER RISK-RATED LOANS. NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER RETAIL AUTO LOAN BALANCES AND A MODERATE INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY. THE AUTO PORTFOLIO PREDOMINANTLY CONSISTS OF PRIME-QUALITY LOANS.

BUSINESS BANKING.

BUSINESS BANKING LOANS INCREASED COMPARED WITH

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN LOAN ORIGINATIONS. NONACCRUAL LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO.

STUDENT AND OTHER.

STUDENT AND OTHER LOANS DECREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE RUN-OFF OF THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO AS THE FIRM CEASED ORIGINATIONS OF STUDENT LOANS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013. NONACCRUAL LOANS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS ALSO DECLINED AS A RESULT OF THE RUN-OFF OF THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS.

PCI LOANS DECREASED AS THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO RUN OFF. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, APPROXIMATELY

12%

OF THE OPTION ARM PCI LOANS WERE DELINQUENT AND APPROXIMATELY

66%

OF THE PORTFOLIO HAD BEEN MODIFIED INTO FIXED-RATE, FULLY AMORTIZING LOANS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING LOANS ARE MAKING AMORTIZING PAYMENTS, ALTHOUGH SUCH PAYMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY FULLY AMORTIZING. THIS LATTER GROUP OF LOANS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF PAYMENT SHOCK DUE TO FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST. DEFAULT RATES GENERALLY INCREASE ON OPTION ARM LOANS WHEN PAYMENT RECAST RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE. THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN DEFAULT RATES IS CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S QUARTERLY IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

CURRENT ESTIMATED LOAN-TO-VALUES OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

THE CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIO FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS RETAINED, EXCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PCI LOANS, WAS

58%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

COMPARED WITH

59%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

ALTHOUGH THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS IS GENERALLY GREATER THAN THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS IN WHICH THE BORROWER HAS GREATER EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL, THE AVERAGE LTV RATIOS HAVE DECLINED CONSISTENT WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN HOME PRICES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LOANS WITH A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%.

THE CURRENT ESTIMATED AVERAGE LTV RATIO FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PCI LOANS, BASED ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES, WAS

64%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, COMPARED WITH

69%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. OF THE TOTAL PCI PORTFOLIO,

4%

OF THE LOANS HAD A CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 100%, AND

1%

HAD A CURRENT LTV RATIO GREATER THAN 125% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, COMPARED WITH

6%

AND

1%

, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

WHILE THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF PCI LOANS, THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON BORROWERS’ BEHAVIOR AND ONGOING ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON HOMES WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY, AS WELL AS ON THE COST OF ALTERNATIVE HOUSING.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON CURRENT ESTIMATED LTVS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, SEE NOTE 14.

LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES – RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFIED LOANS GENERALLY DIFFERS BY PRODUCT TYPE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN BOTH THE CREDIT QUALITY AND THE TYPES OF MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS, THAT HAVE BEEN SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

21%

FOR HOME EQUITY AND

22%

FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES. THE CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO THAT HAVE BEEN SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

20%

FOR HOME EQUITY,

19%

FOR PRIME MORTGAGES,

16%

FOR OPTION ARMS AND

32%

FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. THE CUMULATIVE REDEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFICATIONS COMPLETED UNDER BOTH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“HAMP”) AND THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY THE FIRM’S MODIFICATION PROGRAM THAT WAS MODELED AFTER HAMP) FROM OCTOBER 1, 2009, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2016.

CERTAIN LOANS THAT WERE MODIFIED UNDER HAMP AND THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS HAVE INTEREST RATE RESET PROVISIONS (“STEP-RATE MODIFICATIONS”). INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS GENERALLY BEGAN TO INCREASE COMMENCING IN 2014 BY 1% PER YEAR, AND CONTINUE TO DO SO, UNTIL THE RATE REACHES A SPECIFIED CAP, TYPICALLY AT A PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATE FOR A FIXED-RATE LOAN AS OF THE MODIFICATION DATE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE CARRYING VALUE OF NON-PCI LOANS AND THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF PCI LOANS

MODIFIED IN ACTIVE STEP-RATE MODIFICATIONS WERE

$3 BILLION

AND

$9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR THIS RISK EXPOSURE AND THE IMPACT OF THESE POTENTIAL INTEREST RATE INCREASES IS CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATE INCREASED TO

1.61%

FROM

1.43%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATES WERE

2.63%

AND

2.51%

, RESPECTIVELY. THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A LARGELY WELL-SEASONED, REWARDS-BASED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. NEW ORIGINATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO, IN LINE WITH THE FIRM’S CREDIT PARAMETERS; THESE ORIGINATIONS HAVE GENERATED HIGHER LOSS RATES, AS ANTICIPATED, THAN THE MORE SEASONED PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO, GIVEN THE HIGHER MIX OF NEAR-PRIME ACCOUNTS BEING ORIGINATED. THESE NEAR-PRIME ACCOUNTS HAVE

NET REVENUE RATES AND RETURNS ON EQUITY THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE PORTFOLIO AVERAGE.

LOANS OUTSTANDING IN THE TOP FIVE STATES OF CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, NEW YORK, FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS CONSISTED OF

$62.8 BILLION

IN RECEIVABLES, OR

44%

OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, COMPARED WITH

$57.5 BILLION

, OR

44%

, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. THE GREATEST GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT CARD RETAINED LOANS IS IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH REPRESENTED

15%

AND

14%

OF TOTAL RETAINED LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AND FICO COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT CARD LOANS, SEE NOTE 14.

MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT CARD LOANS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM HAD

$1.2 BILLION

AND

$1.5 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF CREDIT CARD LOANS OUTSTANDING THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS. THESE BALANCES INCLUDED BOTH CREDIT CARD LOANS WITH MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS AND CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT REVERTED BACK TO THEIR PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS BECAUSE THE CARDHOLDER DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS. THE DECREASE IN MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS OUTSTANDING FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN NEW MODIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ONGOING PAYMENTS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON PREVIOUSLY MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S POLICY, ALL CREDIT CARD LOANS TYPICALLY REMAIN ON ACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL CHARGED OFF. HOWEVER, THE FIRM ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS OFFSET AGAINST LOANS AND CHARGED TO INTEREST INCOME, FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF ACCRUED AND BILLED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO BORROWERS, SEE NOTE 14.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH UNDERWRITING, LENDING, MARKET-MAKING, AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES WITH AND FOR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH VARIOUS OPERATING SERVICES SUCH AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES. A PORTION OF THE LOANS ORIGINATED OR ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IS GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE FIRM DISTRIBUTES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE LOANS IT ORIGINATES INTO THE MARKET AS PART OF ITS SYNDICATED LOAN BUSINESS AND TO MANAGE PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS AND CREDIT RISK.

THE WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING THE OIL & GAS, NATURAL GAS PIPELINES, AND METALS & MINING PORTFOLIOS, CONTINUED TO BE GENERALLY STABLE FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, CHARACTERIZED BY LOW LEVELS OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURE, NONACCRUAL LOANS AND CHARGE-OFFS. SEE INDUSTRY DISCUSSION ON

PAGES 97–101

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. GROWTH IN RETAINED LOANS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IN COMMERCIAL BANKING, AND ACROSS MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIES IN COMMERCIAL BANKING AND THE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK. DISCIPLINE IN UNDERWRITING ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING CONTINUES TO REMAIN A KEY POINT OF FOCUS. THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS ACTIVELY MANAGED, IN PART BY CONDUCTING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH REVIEWS OF CLIENT CREDIT QUALITY AND TRANSACTION STRUCTURE, INCLUSIVE OF COLLATERAL WHERE APPLICABLE; AND OF INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURES AND/OR WHICH PRESENT ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS.

REAL ESTATE

EXPOSURE TO THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY WAS APPROXIMATELY 16.1% AND 14.6% OF THE FIRM’S TOTAL WHOLESALE EXPOSURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMITMENTS (INCLUDING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES) AND GUARANTEES, TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN ON THESE COMMITMENTS OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, AND THE COUNTERPARTIES SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS.

IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRM’S FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTIMATED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRM’S LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS

$204.6 BILLION

AND

$212.4 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY.

CLEARING SERVICES

THE FIRM PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES FOR CLIENTS ENTERING INTO SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH THE PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN LOSSES INCURRED BY CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS CREDIT RISK TO ITS CLIENTS THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF ADEQUATE MARGIN AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND CAN ALSO CEASE PROVISION OF CLEARING SERVICES IF CLIENTS DO NOT ADHERE TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEARING AGREEMENT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CLEARING SERVICES, SEE NOTE 29.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. DERIVATIVES ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT AND OTHER MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THE NATURE OF THE COUNTERPARTY AND THE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM OF THE DERIVATIVE AFFECT THE CREDIT RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. FOR OTC DERIVATIVES THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. FOR EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES (“ETD”), SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS AND “CLEARED” OVER-THE-COUNTER (“OTC-CLEARED”) DERIVATIVES, THE FIRM IS GENERALLY EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE RELEVANT CCP. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE USE OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, COUNTERPARTIES AND SETTLEMENT TYPES, SEE NOTE 6.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WERE

$64.1 BILLION

AND

$59.7 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENT’S VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK SHOULD ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ADDITIONAL LIQUID SECURITIES (PRIMARILY U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES AND OTHER GROUP OF SEVEN NATIONS (“G7”) GOVERNMENT BONDS) AND OTHER CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM AGGREGATING

$22.7 BILLION

AND

$16.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY, THAT MAY BE USED AS SECURITY WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CLIENT’S EXPOSURE IS IN THE FIRM’S FAVOR. THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES WAS PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN CIB. THE INCREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF MARKET MOVEMENTS, WHICH INCREASED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RECEIVABLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES.

IN ADDITION TO THE COLLATERAL DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL (PRIMARILY CASH, G7 GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, OTHER LIQUID GOVERNMENT-AGENCY AND GUARANTEED SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES) DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY AND COLLATERAL THAT THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. ALTHOUGH THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE BALANCES AND IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CLIENT’S DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRM’S FAVOR. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES FAIR VALUE, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE 6.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (“DRE”), AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE (“AVG”). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

PEAK REPRESENTS A CONSERVATIVE MEASURE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY CALCULATED IN A MANNER THAT IS BROADLY EQUIVALENT TO A 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION. PEAK IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR SETTING OF CREDIT LIMITS FOR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND DERIVATIVES EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT. DRE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS USED FOR AGGREGATING DERIVATIVE CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES WITH LOANS AND OTHER CREDIT RISK.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CVA, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. THE THREE YEAR AVG EXPOSURE WAS

$31.1 BILLION

AND

$32.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF

$41.4 BILLION

AND

$43.1 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRM’S AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT

102

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF WRONG-WAY RISK, WHICH IS BROADLY DEFINED AS THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY (AVG) AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT QUALITY. MANY FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE CORRELATIONS OVER TIME. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE CORRELATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE FIRM MAY ADJUST THE CVA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY’S AVG. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE ACCOMPANYING GRAPH SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO THE FIRM’S CURRENT DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE PEAK, DRE AND AVG METRICS. THE THREE MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW THAT EXPOSURE WILL DECLINE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES ARE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER, AND SECOND, AS AN END-USER TO MANAGE THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS EXPOSURES. FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S END-USER ACTIVITIES ARE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (COLLECTIVELY, “CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT” ACTIVITIES). INFORMATION ON CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IS PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6.

THE FIRM ALSO USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS AN END-USER TO MANAGE OTHER EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM CERTAIN SECURITIES HELD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES; FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN THE FIRM’S CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER U.S. GAAP; THESE DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. IN CONTRAST, THE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BEING RISK-MANAGED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. THIS ASYMMETRY IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT,

BETWEEN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, CAUSES EARNINGS VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (“CDS”) AS A HEDGE AGAINST THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES MAY VARY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITY (I.E., THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE LOSSES ON SPECIFIC EXPOSURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE PURCHASED CDS); THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE CDS (WHICH MAY HAVE A DEFINED CREDIT EVENT THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH AN ACTUAL LOSS REALIZED BY THE FIRM); AND THE MATURITY OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION (WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE SHORTER THAN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES). HOWEVER, THE FIRM GENERALLY SEEKS TO PURCHASE CREDIT PROTECTION WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS THE SAME OR SIMILAR TO THE MATURITY DATE OF THE EXPOSURE FOR WHICH THE PROTECTION WAS PURCHASED, AND REMAINING DIFFERENCES IN MATURITY ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS BOTH THE CONSUMER (PRIMARILY SCORED) PORTFOLIO AND WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RELATED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON

PAGES 132–134

AND NOTE 15.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO.

THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. CHANGES TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDED REDUCTIONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, REFLECTING CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN HOME PRICES AND LOWER DELINQUENCIES, AS WELL AS RUNOFF IN THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE REDUCTIONS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REFLECTING LOAN GROWTH IN THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO (INCLUDING NEWER VINTAGES WHICH, AS ANTICIPATED, HAVE HIGHER LOSS RATES COMPARED TO THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO), AS WELL AS LOAN GROWTH IN THE AUTO AND BUSINESS BANKING LOAN PORTFOLIOS.

NOTE.

IN THE TABLE ABOVE, THE FINANCIAL MEASURES WHICH EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF PCI LOANS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

(A)

WRITE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS ARE RECORDED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN ACTUAL LOSSES FOR A POOL EXCEED ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. A WRITE-OFF OF A PCI LOAN IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS REMOVED FROM A POOL (E.G., UPON LIQUIDATION).

(B)

INCLUDES RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR. THE ASSET-SPECIFIC CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MODIFIED IN A TDR IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE LOANS’ ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES AND DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY INCREMENTAL PENALTY RATES.

(C)

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

(D)

THE FIRM’S POLICY IS GENERALLY TO EXEMPT CREDIT CARD LOANS FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

COUNTRY RISK IS THE RISK THAT A SOVEREIGN EVENT OR ACTION ALTERS THE VALUE OR TERMS OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF OBLIGORS, COUNTERPARTIES AND ISSUERS OR ADVERSELY AFFECTS MARKETS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR COUNTRY. THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS, DETERMINING RISK TOLERANCE, AND MEASURING AND MONITORING DIRECT COUNTRY EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICIES FOR MANAGING COUNTRY RISK IN BOTH EMERGING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ACTIVELY MONITORS THE VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS GIVING RISE TO COUNTRY RISK TO ENSURE THE FIRM’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURES ARE DIVERSIFIED AND THAT EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE FIRM’S STRATEGY AND RISK TOLERANCE RELATIVE TO A COUNTRY.

COUNTRY RISK ORGANIZATION

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP, PART OF THE INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER RISK FUNCTIONS TO ASSESS AND MONITOR COUNTRY RISK WITHIN THE FIRM. THE FIRMWIDE RISK EXECUTIVE FOR COUNTRY RISK REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK FRAMEWORK

•

ASSIGNING SOVEREIGN RATINGS AND ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS

•

MEASURING AND MONITORING COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE AND STRESS ACROSS THE FIRM

•

MANAGING COUNTRY LIMITS AND REPORTING TRENDS AND LIMIT BREACHES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT

•

DEVELOPING SURVEILLANCE TOOLS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS

•

PROVIDING COUNTRY RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS

COUNTRY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO COUNTRY RISK THROUGH ITS LENDING AND DEPOSITS, INVESTING, AND MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. COUNTRY EXPOSURE INCLUDES ACTIVITY WITH BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY. UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, COUNTRY EXPOSURE IS REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED OR WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUE IS DERIVED, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE DOMICILE (LEGAL RESIDENCE) OR COUNTRY OF INCORPORATION OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR. COUNTRY EXPOSURES ARE GENERALLY MEASURED BY CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S RISK TO AN IMMEDIATE DEFAULT OF THE COUNTERPARTY OR OBLIGOR, WITH ZERO RECOVERY. ASSUMPTIONS ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE MEASUREMENT AND ALLOCATION OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN TRANCHED CREDIT DERIVATIVES. DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT APPROACHES OR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF REPORTED COUNTRY EXPOSURE.

UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK.

•

LENDING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THE TOTAL COMMITTED

AMOUNT (FUNDED AND UNFUNDED), NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES COLLATERAL RE

CEIVED

•

DEPOSITS ARE MEASURED AS THE CASH BALANCES PLACED WITH CENTRAL AND COMMERCIAL BANKS

•

SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR RECEIVABLE BALANCE, NET OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED

•

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL POSITIONS, INCLUDING BOTH LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS

•

COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES IS MEASURED AT THE DERIVATIVE’S FAIR VALUE, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF MARKET MOVEMENTS

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IS REPORTED BASED ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY AND IS MEASURED AT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED OR SOLD, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES IS MEASURED ON A NET BASIS, AS SUCH ACTIVITIES OFTEN RESULT IN SELLING AND PURCHASING PROTECTION RELATED TO THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY; THIS REFLECTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES THESE EXPOSURES

SOME ACTIVITIES MAY CREATE CONTINGENT OR INDIRECT EXPOSURE RELATED TO A COUNTRY (FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES OR SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO COLLATERAL ON SECURITIES FINANCING RECEIVABLES). THESE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE FIRM’S CREDIT, MARKET, AND OPERATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE, RATHER THAN THROUGH COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK REPORTING DIFFERS FROM THE REPORTING PROVIDED UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FFIEC’S REPORTING METHODOLOGY, SEE CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS ON

PAGE 292.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

COUNTRY RISK STRESS TESTING

THE COUNTRY RISK STRESS FRAMEWORK AIMS TO ESTIMATE LOSSES ARISING FROM A COUNTRY CRISIS BY CAPTURING THE IMPACT OF LARGE ASSET PRICE MOVEMENTS IN A COUNTRY BASED ON MARKET SHOCKS COMBINED WITH COUNTERPARTY SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS. COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY DEFINES AND RUNS AD HOC STRESS SCENARIOS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE CONCERNS.

COUNTRY RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES FOR SOVEREIGN RATINGS REVIEWS AND LIMIT MANAGEMENT. COUNTRY STRESS AND NOMINAL EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED UNDER A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY LIMIT FRAMEWORK. COUNTRY RATINGS AND LIMITS ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND REPORTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. COUNTRY LIMIT REQUIREMENTS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS OFTEN AS NECESSARY, BUT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP USES SURVEILLANCE TOOLS, SUCH AS SIGNALING MODELS AND RATINGS INDICATORS, FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS.

COUNTRY RISK REPORTING

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRM’S TOP 20 EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY (EXCLUDING THE U.S.) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. THE SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRM’S LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES BY COUNTRY, BASED ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FIRM’S VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS. COUNTRY EXPOSURES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET FLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN EXPOSURE TO GERMANY, JAPAN AND LUXEMBOURG SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2015 LARGELY REFLECTS HIGHER EURO AND YEN BALANCES, PREDOMINANTLY PLACED ON DEPOSIT AT THE CENTRAL BANKS OF THESE COUNTRIES, DRIVEN BY CHANGING CLIENT POSITIONS AND PREVAILING MARKET AND LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS OR THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, COMPOSITION AND TENOR OF FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT

THE FIRM HAS A LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT FUNCTION WHOSE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE ASSESSMENT, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, AND CONTROL OF LIQUIDITY RISK ACROSS THE FIRM. LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT IS MANAGED THROUGH A DEDICATED FIRMWIDE LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT GROUP. THE CIO, TREASURY AND CORPORATE (“CTC”) CRO, WHO REPORTS TO THE CRO, AS PART OF THE INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIRMWIDE LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT. LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT’S RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE BUT ARE

NOT LIMITED TO.

•

ESTABLISHING AND MONITORING LIMITS, INDICATORS, AND THRESHOLDS, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY APPETITE TOLERANCES;

•

DEFINING, MONITORING, AND REPORTING INTERNAL FIRMWIDE AND MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITY LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS, AND MONITORING AND REPORTING REGULATORY DEFINED LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING;

•

MONITORING AND REPORTING LIQUIDITY POSITIONS, BALANCE SHEET VARIANCES AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES;

•

CONDUCTING AD HOC ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL EMERGING LIQUIDITY RISKS.

RISK GOVERNANCE AND MEASUREMENT

SPECIFIC COMMITTEES RESPONSIBLE FOR LIQUIDITY GOVERNANCE INCLUDE FIRMWIDE ALCO AS WELL AS LINE OF BUSINESS AND REGIONAL ALCOS, AND THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, THE DRPC REVIEWS AND RECOMMENDS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, FOR FORMAL APPROVAL, THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCES, LIQUIDITY STRATEGY, AND LIQUIDITY POLICY AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF ALCO AND OTHER RISK-RELATED COMMITTEES, SEE ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 71–75.

INTERNAL STRESS TESTING

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THE FIRM HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY UNDER A VARIETY OF ADVERSE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING SCENARIOS ANALYZED AS PART OF THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING. STRESS SCENARIOS ARE PRODUCED FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“PARENT COMPANY”) AND THE FIRM’S MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITIES ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AD HOC STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED, AS NEEDED, IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ASSUME ALL OF THE FIRM’S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MET AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARYING LEVELS OF ACCESS TO UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING MARKETS, ESTIMATED NON-CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS AND POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENTS TO THE AVAILABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF LIQUIDITY BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS AND MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITIES SUCH AS REGULATORY, LEGAL OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS ARE MODELED ACROSS A RANGE OF TIME HORIZONS AND CONTEMPLATE BOTH MARKET AND IDIOSYNCRATIC STRESS.

RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE FORMULATION OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING PLAN AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE PARENT COMPANY ACTS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE FIRM THROUGH STOCK AND LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES, AND THE IHC PROVIDES FUNDING SUPPORT TO THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF THE PARENT COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS NECESSARY. THE FIRM MAINTAINS LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE IHC, IN ADDITION TO LIQUIDITY HELD AT THE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO COMPLY WITH LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCES AND MINIMUM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, TO MANAGE THROUGH PERIODS OF STRESS WHERE ACCESS TO NORMAL FUNDING SOURCES IS DISRUPTED.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

TREASURY AND CIO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ARE TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM’S CORE BUSINESSES AND MATERIAL LEGAL ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF CLIENT NEEDS, MEET CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH NORMAL ECONOMIC CYCLES AS WELL AS DURING STRESS EVENTS, AND TO MANAGE AN OPTIMAL FUNDING MIX, AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES. THE FIRM MANAGES LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING USING A CENTRALIZED, GLOBAL APPROACH ACROSS ITS ENTITIES, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THEIR CURRENT LIQUIDITY PROFILE AND ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES OVER TIME, IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND USES.

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, TREASURY AND CIO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

ANALYZING AND UNDERSTANDING THE LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRM, LINES OF BUSINESS AND LEGAL ENTITIES’ ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS;

•

DEFINING AND MONITORING FIRMWIDE AND LEGAL ENTITY-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY STRATEGIES, POLICIES, GUIDELINES, AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANS;

•

MANAGING LIQUIDITY WITHIN APPROVED LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE TOLERANCES AND LIMITS;

•

SETTING TRANSFER PRICING IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNDERLYING LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS OF BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

THE FIRM’S CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN (“CFP”), WHICH IS REVIEWED BY ALCO AND APPROVED BY THE DRPC, IS A COMPILATION OF PROCEDURES AND ACTION PLANS FOR MANAGING LIQUIDITY THROUGH STRESS EVENTS. THE CFP INCORPORATES THE LIMITS AND INDICATORS SET BY THE LIQUIDITY RISK OVERSIGHT GROUP. THESE LIMITS AND INDICATORS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY TO IDENTIFY THE EMERGENCE OF RISKS OR VULNERABILITIES IN THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE CFP IDENTIFIES THE ALTERNATIVE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM IN A STRESS EVENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

LCR AND NSFR

THE U.S. LCR RULE REQUIRES THE FIRM TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF HQLA HELD BY THE FIRM IN RELATION TO ESTIMATED NET CASH OUTFLOWS WITHIN A 30-DAY PERIOD DURING AN ACUTE STRESS EVENT. THE LCR WAS REQUIRED TO BE 90% AT JANUARY 1, 2016, INCREASED TO A MINIMUM OF 100% COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2017. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE FULLY PHASED-IN U.S. LCR.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2016 THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED FINAL U.S. LCR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. STARTING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE QUARTERLY ITS CONSOLIDATED LCR PURSUANT TO THE U.S. LCR RULE, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S AVERAGE LCR FOR THE QUARTER AND THE KEY QUANTITATIVE COMPONENTS OF THE AVERAGE LCR IN A STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE, ALONG WITH A QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL DRIVERS OF THE RATIO, CHANGES OVER TIME, AND CAUSES OF SUCH CHANGES.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE FINAL STANDARD FOR THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (“BASEL NSFR”) IS INTENDED TO MEASURE THE ADEQUACY OF “AVAILABLE” AND “REQUIRED” AMOUNTS OF STABLE FUNDING OVER A ONE-YEAR HORIZON. BASEL NSFR WILL BECOME A MINIMUM STANDARD BY JANUARY 1, 2018 AND REQUIRES THAT THIS RATIO BE EQUAL TO AT LEAST 100% ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

ON APRIL 26, 2016, THE U.S. NSFR PROPOSAL WAS RELEASED FOR LARGE BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND WAS LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH BASEL NSFR. THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT WOULD APPLY BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL NSFR TIMELINE.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES IT WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE PROPOSED U.S. NSFR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPOSED RULE.

HQLA

HQLA IS THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS THAT QUALIFY FOR INCLUSION IN THE U.S. LCR. HQLA PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF CASH AND CERTAIN UNENCUMBERED HIGH QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS AS DEFINED IN THE FINAL RULE.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM’S HQLA WAS

$524 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$496 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. THE INCREASE IN HQLA PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF SALES, MATURITIES AND PAYDOWNS IN NON-HQLA-ELIGIBLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS DEPOSIT GROWTH IN EXCESS OF LOAN GROWTH. CERTAIN OF THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN INCREASED EXCESS LIQUIDITY AT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. WHICH IS EXCLUDED FROM THE FIRM’S HQLA AS REQUIRED UNDER THE U.S. LCR RULES. THE FIRM’S HQLA MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO NORMAL FLOWS FROM CLIENT ACTIVITY.

OF UNENCUMBERED MARKETABLE SECURITIES, SUCH AS EQUITY SECURITIES AND FIXED INCOME DEBT SECURITIES, AVAILABLE TO RAISE LIQUIDITY, IF REQUIRED. THIS INCLUDES HQLA-ELIGIBLE SECURITIES INCLUDED AS PART OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY AT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THE FIRM ALSO MAINTAINS BORROWING CAPACITY AT VARIOUS FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (“FHLBS”), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A RESULT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY THE FIRM TO SUCH BANKS. ALTHOUGH AVAILABLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW THE BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND THE VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM’S REMAINING BORROWING CAPACITY AT VARIOUS FHLBS AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW WAS APPROXIMATELY

$221 BILLION

. THIS REMAINING BORROWING CAPACITY EXCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES INCLUDED IN HQLA OR OTHER UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY HELD AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW, BUT FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS NOT DRAWN LIQUIDITY.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIRM’S UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM FUNDS ITS GLOBAL BALANCE SHEET THROUGH DIVERSE SOURCES OF FUNDING INCLUDING A STABLE DEPOSIT FRANCHISE AS WELL AS SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO (

$894.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

), IS FUNDED WITH A PORTION OF THE FIRM’S DEPOSITS (

$1,375.2 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

) AND THROUGH SECURITIZATIONS AND, WITH RESPECT TO A PORTION OF THE FIRM’S REAL ESTATE-RELATED LOANS, WITH SECURED BORROWINGS FROM THE FHLBS. DEPOSITS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT UTILIZED TO FUND LOANS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OR DEPLOYED IN CASH OR OTHER SHORT-TERM LIQUID INVESTMENTS BASED ON THEIR INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK CHARACTERISTICS. SECURITIES BORROWED OR PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND TRADING ASSETS-

A KEY STRENGTH OF THE FIRM IS ITS DIVERSIFIED DEPOSIT FRANCHISE, THROUGH EACH OF ITS LINES OF BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING AND LIMITS RELIANCE ON THE WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRM’S DEPOSITS ARE CONSUMER DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED A STABLE SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE OPERATING DEPOSITS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE STABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY BECAUSE THEY ARE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT MAINTAIN OPERATING SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FIRM.

). THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS. THE INCREASE IN CONSUMER DEPOSITS REFLECTED CONTINUING STRONG GROWTH FROM EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS, AND THE IMPACT OF LOW ATTRITION RATES.

THE WHOLESALE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN OPERATING DEPOSITS RELATED TO CLIENT ACTIVITY IN CIB’S TREASURY SERVICES BUSINESS, AND INFLOWS IN AWM PRIMARILY FROM BUSINESS GROWTH AND THE IMPACT OF NEW RULES GOVERNING MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SHORT-TERM FUNDING

THE FIRM’S SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED FUNDING PRIMARILY CONSIST OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE. SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE ARE SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES COLLATERAL, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT AND AGENCY MBS, AND CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, COMPARED WITH THE BALANCE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER SECURED FINANCING OF TRADING ASSETS-DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS IN THE CIB RELATED TO CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THE BALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FLUCTUATE OVER TIME DUE TO CUSTOMERS’ INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES; THE FIRM’S DEMAND FOR FINANCING; THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ITS SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING (FOR BOTH THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS); AND OTHER MARKET AND PORTFOLIO FACTORS.

LONG-TERM FUNDING AND ISSUANCE

LONG-TERM FUNDING PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF STABLE FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM. THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM FUNDING PLAN IS DRIVEN BY EXPECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY, LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING TLAC REQUIREMENTS. LONG-TERM FUNDING OBJECTIVES INCLUDE MAINTAINING DIVERSIFICATION, MAXIMIZING MARKET ACCESS AND OPTIMIZING FUNDING COSTS. THE FIRM EVALUATES VARIOUS FUNDING MARKETS, TENORS AND CURRENCIES IN CREATING ITS OPTIMAL LONG-TERM FUNDING PLAN.

THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS ISSUED BY THE PARENT COMPANY TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN SUPPORT OF BOTH BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARY FUNDING NEEDS. THE PARENT COMPANY ADVANCES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NET FUNDING PROCEEDS TO THE IHC. THE IHC DOES NOT ISSUE DEBT TO EXTERNAL COUNTERPARTIES.

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM’S FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-

PARTY COMMITMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN CREDIT RATINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPES ON PAGE

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2017, MOODY’S PUBLISHED ITS UPDATED RATING METHODOLOGIES FOR SECURITIES FIRMS.  SUBSEQUENTLY, AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC’S LONG-TERM ISSUER RATING WAS DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH FROM AA3 TO A1.  THE SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATING WAS UNCHANGED AND THE OUTLOOK REMAINED STABLE.

DOWNGRADES OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM RATINGS BY ONE OR TWO NOTCHES COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN ITS COST OF FUNDS, AND ACCESS TO CERTAIN FUNDING MARKETS COULD BE REDUCED AS NOTED ABOVE. THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OF RATINGS DOWNGRADES DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS CONTRACTUAL AND

BEHAVIORAL FACTORS (WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES ARE INCORPORATED IN ITS LIQUIDITY RISK AND STRESS TESTING METRICS). THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT IT MAINTAINS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO WITHSTAND A POTENTIAL DECREASE IN FUNDING CAPACITY DUE TO RATINGS DOWNGRADES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNSECURED DEBT DOES NOT CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, PROVIDE ANY LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE BORROWINGS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, BASED ON UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, OR STOCK PRICE.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES. RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, FUTURE PROFITABILITY, RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND LITIGATION MATTERS, AS WELL AS THEIR BROADER RATINGS METHODOLOGIES. CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS.

ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND ENDEAVORS TO MANAGE, TO THE EXTENT IT IS ABLE, FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS CREDIT RATINGS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM POTENTIAL ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EQUITY PRICES, COMMODITY PRICES, IMPLIED VOLATILITIES OR CREDIT SPREADS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT MONITORS MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND DEFINES MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO MANAGE RISK, FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK PROFILE FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

ESTABLISHMENT OF A MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF LINE OF BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE MARKET RISK

•

DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS

•

PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, TO ASSESS RISK INCLUDING.

•

VAR

•

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

•

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

•

LOSS ADVISORIES

•

PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

•

EARNINGS-AT-RISK

•

OTHER SENSITIVITIES

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS MANAGED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS SET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY AND ACCOMMODATION OF CLIENT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE. THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE OF BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS. LIMITS MAY ALSO BE SET WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AT THE PORTFOLIO OR LEGAL ENTITY LEVEL.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT SETS LIMITS AND REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES THEM AS APPROPRIATE, WITH ANY CHANGES APPROVED BY LINE OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S CEO AND CRO, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING CERTAIN OF THESE RISK LIMITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. ALL LIMITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED.

LIMIT BREACHES ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO LIMIT APPROVERS, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH, MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT CONSULTS WITH FIRM SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE LINE OF BUSINESS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION REQUIRED TO RETURN TO COMPLIANCE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A REDUCTION IN RISK IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE BREACH. CERTAIN FIRM OR LINE OF BUSINESS-LEVEL LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN BREACHED FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS OR LONGER, OR BY MORE THAN 30%, ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

AS PART OF THE FIRM’S EVALUATION AND PERIODIC ENHANCEMENT OF ITS MARKET RISK MEASURES, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 THE FIRM REFINED THE SCOPE OF POSITIONS INCLUDED IN RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS IN THE CIB, EXPOSURE ARISING FROM NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED FUNDING ACTIVITIES IN CORPORATE, AS WELL AS SEED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN AWM WERE REMOVED FROM THE VAR CALCULATION. COMMENCING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016, EXPOSURE ARISING FROM THESE POSITIONS IS CAPTURED USING OTHER SENSITIVITY-BASED MEASURES, SUCH AS A 10% DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OR A 1 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN SPREADS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE OTHER SENSITIVITY-BASED MEASURES AT PAGE 123. THE FIRM BELIEVES THIS REFINEMENT TO ITS REPORTED VAR MEASURES MORE APPROPRIATELY CAPTURES THE RISK OF ITS MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS. THIS CHANGE DID NOT IMPACT REGULATORY VAR AS THESE POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF REGULATORY VAR. REGULATORY VAR IS USED TO DERIVE THE FIRM’S REGULATORY VAR-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL III.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES VAR, A STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE,

TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN A NORMAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM HAS A SINGLE VAR FRAMEWORK USED AS A BASIS FOR CALCULATING

RISK MANAGEMENT VAR

AND

REGULATORY VAR.

THE FRAMEWORK IS EMPLOYED ACROSS THE FIRM USING HISTORICAL SIMULATION BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THE FRAMEWORK’S APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE USE OF RISK MANAGEMENT VAR

PROVIDES A STABLE MEASURE OF VAR THAT IS CLOSELY ALIGNED TO THE DAY-TO-DAY RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AND PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESPOND TO RISK EVENTS ON A DAILY BASIS.

THE FIRM’S

RISK MANAGEMENT VAR IS CALCULATED ASSUMING A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY WHICH APPROXIMATES A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

RISK MANAGEMENT

VAR PROVIDES A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND IS USED FOR AGGREGATING RISKS AND MONITORING LIMITS ACROSS BUSINESSES. THOSE VAR RESULTS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

UNDER THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR METHODOLOGY, ASSUMING CURRENT CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL CHANGES USED IN THE SIMULATION, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR VAR “BACK-TESTING EXCEPTIONS,” DEFINED AS LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES, ON AVERAGE FIVE TIMES EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS. THE NUMBER OF VAR BACK-TESTING EXCEPTIONS OBSERVED CAN DIFFER FROM THE STATISTICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER OF BACK-TESTING EXCEPTIONS IF THE CURRENT LEVEL OF MARKET VOLATILITY IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE LEVEL OF MARKET VOLATILITY DURING THE 12 MONTHS OF HISTORICAL DATA USED IN THE VAR CALCULATION.

UNDERLYING THE OVERALL VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK ARE INDIVIDUAL VAR MODELS THAT SIMULATE HISTORICAL MARKET RETURNS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND/OR RISK FACTORS. TO CAPTURE MATERIAL MARKET RISKS AS PART OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, COMPREHENSIVE VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE PERFORMED DAILY FOR BUSINESSES WHOSE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO MARKET RISK. THESE VAR MODELS ARE GRANULAR AND INCORPORATE NUMEROUS RISK FACTORS AND INPUTS TO SIMULATE DAILY CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OVER THE HISTORICAL PERIOD; INPUTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF EACH PORTFOLIO, AS SENSITIVITIES AND HISTORICAL TIME SERIES USED TO GENERATE DAILY MARKET VALUES MAY BE DIFFERENT ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES OR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE VAR MODEL RESULTS ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIOS ARE AGGREGATED AT THE FIRM LEVEL.

SINCE VAR IS BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, IT IS AN IMPERFECT MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL LOSSES, AND IT IS NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF STRESSED MARKET CONDITIONS OR TO MANAGE ANY IMPACT FROM POTENTIAL STRESS EVENTS. IN ADDITION, BASED ON THEIR RELIANCE ON AVAILABLE HISTORICAL DATA, LIMITED TIME HORIZONS, AND OTHER FACTORS, VAR MEASURES ARE INHERENTLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO MEASURE CERTAIN RISKS AND TO PREDICT LOSSES, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET ILLIQUIDITY AND SUDDEN OR SEVERE SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.

FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SPECIFIC RISK PARAMETERS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN VAR DUE TO THE LACK OF INHERENT LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HISTORICAL DATA. THE FIRM USES PROXIES TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHEN DAILY TIME SERIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS LIKELY THAT USING AN ACTUAL PRICE-BASED TIME SERIES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD AFFECT THE VAR RESULTS PRESENTED. THE FIRM THEREFORE CONSIDERS OTHER MEASURES SUCH AS STRESS TESTING, IN ADDITION TO VAR, TO CAPTURE AND MANAGE ITS MARKET RISK POSITIONS.

THE DAILY MARKET DATA USED IN VAR MODELS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTED FOR VCG PRICE TESTING IN ITS MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CASES WHERE MARKET PRICES ARE NOT OBSERVABLE, OR WHERE PROXIES ARE USED IN VAR HISTORICAL TIME SERIES, THE DATA SOURCES MAY DIFFER (SEE VALUATION PROCESS IN NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS). BECAUSE VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS REQUIRE DAILY DATA AND A CONSISTENT SOURCE FOR VALUATION, IT MAY NOT BE PRACTICAL TO USE THE DATA COLLECTED IN THE VCG MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS FOR VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS.

THE FIRM’S VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY EVALUATED AND ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIRM’S MODELING TECHNIQUES AND MEASUREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. SUCH CHANGES MAY AFFECT HISTORICAL COMPARISONS OF VAR RESULTS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING MODEL REVIEWS AND APPROVALS, SEE MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGE 128.

THE FIRM CALCULATES SEPARATELY A DAILY AGGREGATED VAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY RULES (“REGULATORY VAR”), WHICH IS USED TO DERIVE THE FIRM’S REGULATORY VAR-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL III. THIS REGULATORY VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY ASSUMES A TEN BUSINESS-DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL LOSS METHODOLOGY WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. REGULATORY VAR IS APPLIED TO “COVERED” POSITIONS AS DEFINED BY BASEL III, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES OF ACCRUAL LOANS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, WHILE REGULATORY VAR EXCLUDES THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES. IN ADDITION, IN CONTRAST TO THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, REGULATORY VAR CURRENTLY EXCLUDES THE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN VAR MODELS.

DESIGNATED AS NM, BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DISTINCT RISK COMPONENTS, AND HENCE IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A PORTFOLIO-DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT.

AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 117, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016 THE FIRM REFINED THE SCOPE OF POSITIONS INCLUDED IN RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE REFINEMENTS, THE AVERAGE VAR, WITHOUT DIVERSIFICATION, FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING REPORTED COMPONENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2016: CIB EQUITIES VAR BY $3 MILLION; CIB TRADING VAR BY $2 MILLION; CIB VAR BY $3 MILLION; CORPORATE VAR BY $4 MILLION; AWM VAR BY $2 MILLION; OTHER VAR BY $4 MILLION; AND TOTAL VAR BY $3 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE TOTAL VAR AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $7 MILLION IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE REFINEMENTS.

AVERAGE TOTAL VAR DECREASED $2 MILLION FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2016 AS COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE REDUCTION IN AVERAGE TOTAL VAR IS DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED SCOPE CHANGES AS WELL AS A LOWER RISK PROFILE IN THE EQUITIES RISK TYPE. THIS WAS OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RISK PROFILES OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND FIXED INCOME RISK TYPES. ADDITIONALLY, AVERAGE CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR DECLINED AS A RESULT OF LOWER EXPOSURES ARISING FROM SELECT POSITIONS.

THE FIRM’S AVERAGE TOTAL VAR DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT WAS $8 MILLION

OR

18%

OF THE SUM FOR 2016, COMPARED WITH $10 MILLION

OR

21%

OF THE SUM FOR 2015.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS AND THE TIME SERIES INPUTS RELATED TO CERTAIN ASSET-BACKED PRODUCTS.

VAR CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES, AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

VAR BACK-TESTING

THE FIRM EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS VAR METHODOLOGY BY BACK-TESTING, WHICH COMPARES THE DAILY RISK MANAGEMENT VAR RESULTS WITH THE DAILY GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON MARKET-RISK RELATED REVENUE.

THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION USED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS UNDER BASEL III. UNDER THIS DEFINITION MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DEFINED AS: GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, EXCLUDING FEES, COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (E.G., LIQUIDITY AND DVA), NET INTEREST INCOME, AND GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM INTRADAY TRADING.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING CHART COMPARES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES WITH THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. AS THE CHART PRESENTS MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THOSE POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, THE RESULTS IN THE TABLE BELOW DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS OF BACK-TESTING DISCLOSED IN THE MARKET RISK SECTION OF THE FIRM’S BASEL III PILLAR 3 REGULATORY CAPITAL DISCLOSURES REPORTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON REGULATORY VAR APPLIED TO COVERED POSITIONS. THE CHART SHOWS THAT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 THE FIRM OBSERVED 5 VAR BACK-TESTING EXCEPTIONS AND POSTED MARKET-RISK RELATED GAINS ON 151 OF THE 260 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD.

OTHER RISK MEASURES

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKETS USING RECENT HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR AS AN INDICATOR OF LOSSES, STRESS TESTING IS INTENDED TO CAPTURE THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM RUNS WEEKLY STRESS TESTS ON MARKET-RELATED RISKS ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS SUCH AS CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES.

THE FIRM USES A NUMBER OF STANDARD SCENARIOS THAT CAPTURE DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES INCLUDING GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS, SPECIFIC IDIOSYNCRATIC FACTORS AND EXTREME TAIL EVENTS. THE STRESS FRAMEWORK CALCULATES MULTIPLE MAGNITUDES OF POTENTIAL STRESS FOR BOTH MARKET RALLIES AND MARKET SELL-OFFS FOR EACH RISK FACTOR AND COMBINES THEM IN MULTIPLE WAYS TO CAPTURE DIFFERENT MARKET SCENARIOS. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN SCENARIOS ASSESS THE POTENTIAL LOSS ARISING FROM CURRENT EXPOSURES HELD BY THE FIRM DUE TO A BROAD SELL OFF IN BOND MARKETS OR AN EXTREME WIDENING IN CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS. THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK ALLOWS RISK MANAGERS TO CONSTRUCT NEW, SPECIFIC SCENARIOS THAT CAN BE USED TO FORM DECISIONS ABOUT FUTURE POSSIBLE STRESS EVENTS.

STRESS TESTING COMPLEMENTS VAR BY ALLOWING RISK MANAGERS

TO SHOCK CURRENT MARKET PRICES TO MORE EXTREME LEVELS RELATIVE TO THOSE HISTORICALLY REALIZED, AND TO STRESS TEST THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MARKET PRICES UNDER EXTREME SCENARIOS.

STRESS SCENARIOS ARE DEFINED AND REVIEWED BY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE REVIEWED BY THE RELEVANT LOB RISK COMMITTEES AND MAY BE REDEFINED ON A PERIODIC BASIS TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND QUALITATIVE EXPLANATIONS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RISK POSITIONS ARE REPORTED TO THE RESPECTIVE LOBS AND THE FIRM’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY OF POSITIONS TO CERTAIN DEFINED EVENTS AND TO ENABLE THEM TO MANAGE THEIR RISKS WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY. RESULTS ARE ALSO REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE FIRM’S STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK IS UTILIZED IN CALCULATING RESULTS UNDER SCENARIOS MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S CCAR AND ICAAP PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRM’S RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK AND ARE ALSO PRESENTED TO THE DRPC.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES INCLUDE SENSITIVITIES TO VARIABLES USED TO VALUE POSITIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES, INTEREST RATE BASIS POINT VALUES AND MARKET VALUES. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY LINE OF

BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE ALSO USED FOR MONITORING INTERNAL MARKET RISK LIMITS.

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS OF RISK TOLERANCE. PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE DEFINED AS THE DECLINE IN NET PROFIT AND LOSS SINCE THE YEAR-TO-DATE PEAK REVENUE LEVEL.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK

THE VAR AND SENSITIVITY MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES.

THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON THE FIRM’S REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT AS INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FIRM’S SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISKS. INTEREST RATE RISK ARISES NOT ONLY FROM TRADING ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO FROM THE FIRM’S TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, WHICH INCLUDE EXTENSION OF LOANS AND CREDIT FACILITIES, TAKING DEPOSITS AND ISSUING DEBT. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE THROUGH EARNINGS-AT-RISK, WHICH MEASURES THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME AND CERTAIN INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FEES.

FOR A SUMMARY BY LINE OF BUSINESS, IDENTIFYING POSITIONS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK, SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 117.

THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES THE FIRM’S STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK POLICIES AND MARKET RISK LIMITS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE DRPC. TREASURY AND CIO, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, CALCULATES THE FIRM’S STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE AND REVIEWS IT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE AND THE FIRM’S

ALCO.

IN ADDITION, OVERSIGHT OF STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK IS MANAGED THROUGH A DEDICATED RISK FUNCTION REPORTING TO THE CTC CRO. THIS RISK FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE AROUND ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTABLISHING AND MONITORING LIMITS FOR STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FIRM MANAGES STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK GENERALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES.

STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK CAN OCCUR DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE (FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE)

•

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

121

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED, FIRMWIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY AND CIO THROUGH A TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR REPRICING, AND ANY INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

THE FIRM GENERATES A BASELINE FOR NET INTEREST INCOME AND CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE FEES, AND THEN CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES FOR INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES (“NON-U.S. DOLLAR” CURRENCIES). EARNINGS-AT-RISK SCENARIOS ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THIS BASELINE, OVER THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS UTILIZING MULTIPLE ASSUMPTIONS. THESE SCENARIOS CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON EXPOSURES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES FROM BASELINE RATES, AS WELL AS PRICING SENSITIVITIES OF DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE SCENARIOS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, AS WELL AS MODELED PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR, BUT DO NOT INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN BY THE FIRM IN RESPONSE TO ANY SUCH INSTANTANEOUS RATE CHANGES. MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON SCENARIO INTEREST RATES COMPARED WITH UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL RATES, THE TIME SINCE ORIGINATION, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE FIRM’S EARNINGS-AT-RISK SCENARIOS ARE PERIODICALLY EVALUATED AND ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIRM’S SIMULATION AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE FIRM’S U.S. DOLLAR SENSITIVITIES ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE NON-U.S. DOLLAR SENSITIVITY SCENARIOS ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRM’S EARNINGS-AT-RISK AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015.

GIVEN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST RATES, DOWNWARD PARALLEL 100 AND 200 BASIS POINT EARNINGS-AT-RISK SCENARIOS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE MEANINGFUL.

THE FIRM’S BENEFIT TO RISING RATES ON U.S. DOLLAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS LARGELY A RESULT OF REINVESTING AT HIGHER YIELDS AND ASSETS REPRICING AT A FASTER PACE THAN DEPOSITS.

THE FIRM’S NET U.S. DOLLAR SENSITIVITY TO A 200 BPS AND

100 BPS INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE IN RATES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION AND $700 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THAT DECREASE WAS THE UPDATING OF THE FIRM’S BASELINE TO REFLECT HIGHER INTEREST RATES. AS HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIRM’S BASELINES, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SENSITIVITY TO FURTHER INCREASES IN RATES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE LESS SIGNIFICANT. THE NET CHANGE IN MIX IN THE FIRM’S SPOT AND FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN THE NET U.S. DOLLAR SENSITIVITY WHEN COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2015.

SEPARATELY, ANOTHER U.S. DOLLAR INTEREST RATE SCENARIO USED BY THE FIRM — INVOLVING A STEEPER YIELD CURVE WITH LONG-TERM RATES RISING BY 100 BASIS POINTS AND SHORT-TERM RATES STAYING AT CURRENT LEVELS — RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH BENEFIT TO NET INTEREST INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$800 MILLION.

THE INCREASE UNDER THIS SCENARIO REFLECTS THE FIRM REINVESTING AT THE HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES, WITH FUNDING COSTS REMAINING UNCHANGED. THE RESULT OF THE COMPARABLE NON-U.S. DOLLAR SCENARIO WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRM.

NON-U.S. DOLLAR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

NON-U.S. DOLLAR FX RISK IS THE RISK THAT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR FUTURE RESULTS. THE FIRM HAS STRUCTURAL NON-U.S. DOLLAR FX EXPOSURES ARISING FROM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, FORECASTED EXPENSE AND REVENUE, THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT ISSUANCE. TREASURY AND CIO, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY MANAGE THESE RISKS ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM. TREASURY AND CIO MAY HEDGE CERTAIN OF THESE RISKS USING DERIVATIVES WITHIN RISK LIMITS GOVERNED BY THE CTC RISK COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY PRIVATELY-HELD FINANCIAL ASSETS AND INSTRUMENTS, TYPICALLY REPRESENTING OWNERSHIP OR JUNIOR CAPITAL POSITIONS, THAT HAVE UNIQUE RISKS DUE TO THEIR ILLIQUIDITY OR FOR WHICH THERE IS LESS OBSERVABLE MARKET OR VALUATION DATA.

SUCH POSITIONS

ARE TYPICALLY INTENDED TO BE HELD OVER EXTENDED INVESTMENT PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NO EXPECTATION FOR SHORT-TERM GAIN WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS COVER MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES AND ARE MADE EITHER IN STAND-ALONE INVESTING BUSINESSES OR AS PART OF A BROADER BUSINESS PLATFORM. ASSET CLASSES INCLUDE TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS (E.G., AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY INVESTMENTS), PRIVATE EQUITY

AND VARIOUS DEBT INVESTMENTS.

INCREASINGLY, NEW PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITY SEEKS TO ENHANCE OR ACCELERATE LINE OF BUSINESS STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE MANAGED UNDER VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS AND ARE REFLECTED WITHIN THE RESPECTIVE LOBS FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO MANAGING PRINCIPAL RISK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. A FIRMWIDE RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK EXISTS FOR ALL PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES. ALL INVESTMENTS ARE APPROVED BY INVESTMENT COMMITTEES THAT INCLUDE EXECUTIVES WHO ARE INDEPENDENT FROM THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. THE FIRM’S INDEPENDENT CONTROL FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT POLICIES. APPROVED LEVELS FOR SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH RELEVANT BUSINESS IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIOS. INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AND POSITION LEVEL CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS STRESS TESTING ON THESE PORTFOLIOS USING SPECIFIC SCENARIOS THAT ESTIMATE LOSSES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET MOVES AND/OR OTHER RISK EVENTS.

124

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

COMPLIANCE RISK IS THE RISK OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS.

OVERVIEW

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING ITS COMPLIANCE RISK. THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE ORGANIZATION (“COMPLIANCE”), WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS, WORKS CLOSELY WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS WITH A FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE OFFERING OF THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS.

THESE COMPLIANCE RISKS RELATE TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS, DEPENDING ON THE LINE OF BUSINESS AND THE JURISDICTION, AND INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS WITH CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, AND EMPLOYEE ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLIANCE RISKS INCLUDE THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE, TRADING ACTIVITIES, MARKET CONDUCT, AND COMPLYING WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL BORDERS, AMONG OTHERS.

OTHER FUNCTIONS SUCH AS FINANCE (INCLUDING TAX), TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCES PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.

COMPLIANCE IMPLEMENTS VARIOUS PRACTICES DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE COMPLIANCE RISK BY ESTABLISHING POLICIES, TESTING, MONITORING, TRAINING AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRM HAS EXPERIENCED HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY BY ITS REGULATORS OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS, AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONTROLS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS REGULATORS REQUIRING THE FIRM TO TAKE CERTAIN SPECIFIED ACTIONS TO REMEDIATE COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND IMPROVE ITS CONTROLS. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT SUCH REGULATORY SCRUTINY WILL CONTINUE.

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

COMPLIANCE IS LED BY THE FIRMS’ CCO WHO REPORTS, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 2016, TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF ITS COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THROUGH THE FIRM’S CCO, LINES OF BUSINESS CCOS AND REGIONAL CCOS TO IMPLEMENT THE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM GLOBALLY ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND REGIONS. THE FIRM’S CCO IS A MEMBER OF THE FCC AND THE FRC. THE FIRM’S CCO ALSO PROVIDES REGULAR UPDATES TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND DRPC. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO OVERSEE THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY CONSENT ORDERS.

THE FIRM HAS IN PLACE A CODE OF CONDUCT (THE “CODE”), AND EACH EMPLOYEE IS GIVEN ANNUAL TRAINING IN RESPECT OF THE CODE AND IS REQUIRED ANNUALLY TO AFFIRM HIS OR HER COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE. THE CODE SETS FORTH THE FIRM’S CORE PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, INCLUDING THAT NO EMPLOYEE SHOULD EVER SACRIFICE INTEGRITY - OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE OR SHE HAS. THE CODE REQUIRES PROMPT REPORTING OF ANY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED VIOLATION OF THE CODE, ANY INTERNAL FIRM POLICY, OR ANY LAW OR REGULATION APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE REPORTING OF ANY ILLEGAL CONDUCT, OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE CODE, BY ANY OF THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT WORKERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, OR AGENTS. SPECIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED AND DESIGNATED AS “CODE SPECIALISTS” WHO ACT AS A RESOURCE TO EMPLOYEES ON CODE MATTERS. IN ADDITION, CONCERNS MAY BE REPORTED ANONYMOUSLY AND THE FIRM PROHIBITS RETALIATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES FOR THE GOOD FAITH REPORTING OF ANY ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE. THE CODE AND THE ASSOCIATED EMPLOYEE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ARE FOCUSED ON THE REGULAR ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN KEY ASPECTS OF THE FIRM’S CULTURE AND CONDUCT INITIATIVES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

CONDUCT RISK IS THE RISK THAT AN EMPLOYEE’S ACTION OR INACTION CAUSES UNDUE HARM TO THE FIRM’S CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, DAMAGES MARKET INTEGRITY, UNDERMINES THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE FIRM’S CULTURE.

OVERVIEW

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS OR FUNCTION IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING ITS CONDUCT RISK TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE ENGAGEMENT, OWNERSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY OF A CULTURE CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S HOW WE DO BUSINESS PRINCIPLES (“PRINCIPLES”). THE PRINCIPLES SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR HOW EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES. WITH THE PRINCIPLES SERVING AS A GUIDE, THE FIRM’S CODE SETS OUT THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH EMPLOYEE AND PROVIDES CERTAIN INFORMATION AND THE RESOURCES TO HELP EMPLOYEES CONDUCT BUSINESS ETHICALLY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW EVERYWHERE THE FIRM OPERATES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CODE, SEE COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGE 125.

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

THE CMDC IS THE PRIMARY BOARD-LEVEL COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES THE FIRM’S CULTURE AND CONDUCT PROGRAMS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT THAT MONITORS COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE. ADDITIONALLY, THE DRPC REVIEWS, AT LEAST ANNUALLY, THE FIRM’S QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDED IN THE RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING CONDUCT RISK. THE DRPC ALSO MEETS ANNUALLY WITH THE CMDC TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS ASPECTS OF THE FIRM’S COMPENSATION PRACTICES.

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT IS INCORPORATED INTO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PEOPLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE, INCLUDING RECRUITING, ONBOARDING, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT, PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT, PROMOTION AND COMPENSATION PROCESSES. BUSINESSES UNDERTAKE ANNUAL RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT (“RCSA”) ASSESSMENTS; AND, AS PART OF THESE RCSA REVIEWS, THEY IDENTIFY THEIR RESPECTIVE KEY INHERENT OPERATIONAL RISKS (INCLUDING CONDUCT RISKS), EVALUATE THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR CONTROLS, IDENTIFY CONTROL GAPS AND DEVELOP ASSOCIATED ACTION PLANS.   THE FIRM’S KNOW YOUR EMPLOYEE FRAMEWORK GENERALLY ADDRESSES HOW THE FIRM MANAGES, OVERSEES AND RESPONDS TO WORKFORCE CONDUCT RELATED MATTERS THAT MAY OTHERWISE EXPOSE THE FIRM TO FINANCIAL, REPUTATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND OTHER OPERATING RISKS. THE FIRM ALSO HAS A HR CONTROL FORUM, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO DISCUSS CONDUCT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT RISK AND CONTROL ISSUES AND REVIEW, WHEN APPROPRIATE, EMPLOYEE ACTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROMOTION AND COMPENSATION ACTIONS.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

LEGAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS OR IMPOSITION OF DAMAGES, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OR TO COMPLY WITH LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT.

OVERVIEW

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES AND ADVICE TO THE FIRM, AND COMMUNICATING AND HELPING THE LINES OF BUSINESS ADJUST TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHANGES THEY FACE, INCLUDING THE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE FIRM’S REGULATORS, THE GLOBAL LEGAL FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE BUSINESSES AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS THEIR ADHERENCE TO LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, LEGAL ASSISTS OVERSIGHT & CONTROL, RISK, FINANCE, COMPLIANCE AND INTERNAL AUDIT IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FIRM’S CORPORATE STANDARDS FOR DOING BUSINESS. THE FIRM’S LAWYERS ALSO ADVISE THE FIRM ON POTENTIAL LEGAL EXPOSURES ON KEY LITIGATION AND TRANSACTIONAL MATTERS, AND PERFORM A SIGNIFICANT DEFENSE AND ADVOCACY ROLE BY DEFENDING THE FIRM AGAINST CLAIMS AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS AND, WHEN NEEDED, PURSUING CLAIMS AGAINST OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THEY ADVISE THE FIRM’S CONFLICTS OFFICE WHICH REVIEWS THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM.

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT

THE FIRM’S GENERAL COUNSEL REPORTS TO THE CEO AND IS A MEMBER OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE FCC. THE GENERAL COUNSEL’S LEADERSHIP TEAM INCLUDES A GENERAL COUNSEL FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, THE HEADS OF THE LITIGATION AND CORPORATE & REGULATORY PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S CORPORATE SECRETARY. EACH REGION (E.G., LATIN AMERICA, ASIA PACIFIC) HAS A GENERAL COUNSEL WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING LEGAL RISK ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND FUNCTIONS IN THE REGION.

LEGAL WORKS WITH VARIOUS COMMITTEES (INCLUDING NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVE AND REPUTATION RISK COMMITTEES) AND THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES TO PROTECT THE FIRM’S REPUTATION BEYOND ANY PARTICULAR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

MODEL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FROM DECISIONS BASED ON INCORRECT OR MISUSED MODEL OUTPUTS.

THE FIRM USES MODELS ACROSS VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS. THE MODELS ARE OF VARYING LEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION AND ARE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS AND THE MEASUREMENT OF RISK, SUCH AS ASSESSING REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CONDUCTING STRESS TESTING, AND MAKING BUSINESS DECISIONS.

MODEL RISKS ARE OWNED BY THE USERS OF THE MODELS WITHIN THE VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS IN THE FIRM BASED ON THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF SUCH MODELS. USERS AND DEVELOPERS OF MODELS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING, IMPLEMENTING AND TESTING THEIR MODELS, AS WELL AS REFERRING MODELS TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. ONCE MODELS HAVE BEEN APPROVED, MODEL USERS AND DEVELOPERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING A ROBUST OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, AND MUST MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MODEL USERS AND DEVELOPERS MAY SEEK TO ENHANCE MODELS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PORTFOLIOS AND IN PRODUCT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS TO CAPTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN AVAILABLE MODELING TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION REVIEWS AND APPROVES A WIDE RANGE OF MODELS, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT, VALUATION AND REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS USED BY THE FIRM. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION IS INDEPENDENT OF MODEL USERS AND DEVELOPERS. THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK EXECUTIVE REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CRO.

MODELS ARE TIERED BASED ON AN INTERNAL STANDARD ACCORDING TO THEIR COMPLEXITY, THE EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODEL AND THE FIRM’S RELIANCE ON THE MODEL. THIS TIERING IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION. A MODEL REVIEW CONDUCTED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION CONSIDERS THE MODEL’S SUITABILITY FOR THE SPECIFIC USES TO WHICH IT WILL BE PUT. THE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN REVIEWING A MODEL INCLUDE WHETHER THE MODEL ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SELECTION AND RELIABILITY OF MODEL INPUTS, CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY MODEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED FROM THE MARKET. WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES. MODEL REVIEWS ARE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION BASED ON THE RELEVANT MODEL TIER.

UNDER THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION REVIEWS AND APPROVES NEW MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION IN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE HEAD OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION MAY GRANT EXCEPTIONS TO THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY TO ALLOW A MODEL TO BE USED PRIOR TO REVIEW OR APPROVAL. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE USER TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE MODEL RISK IF IT IS TO BE USED IN THE INTERIM. THESE ACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE MODEL AND MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR DUE TO EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT ARE NEITHER MARKET- NOR CREDIT-RELATED.

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES AND

CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR FAILURE OF VENDORS TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES, LITIGATION AND REGULATORY FINES, AS WELL AS OTHER DAMAGES TO THE FIRM. THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS IN LIGHT OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, AND THE MARKETS AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM HAS AN OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE ORMF IS COMPRISED OF FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, RISK ASSESSMENT, MEASUREMENT, AND MONITORING AND REPORTING.

GOVERNANCE

THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OWNING AND MANAGING THEIR OPERATIONAL RISKS. THE FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP, WHICH CONSISTS OF CONTROL OFFICERS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY EXECUTION OF THE ORMF.

LINE OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION CONTROL COMMITTEES OVERSEE THE OPERATIONAL RISK AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS. THESE COMMITTEES ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK ISSUES TO THE FCC, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FCC, SEE ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 71–75.

THE FIRMWIDE RISK EXECUTIVE FOR OPERATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE (“ORG”), A DIRECT REPORT TO THE CRO, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFINING THE ORMF AND ESTABLISHING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ITS EXECUTION. OPERATIONAL RISK OFFICERS REPORT TO BOTH THE LINE OF BUSINESS CROS AND TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK EXECUTIVE FOR ORG, AND ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS THEY OVERSEE.

THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK APPETITE POLICY IS APPROVED BY THE DRPC. THIS POLICY ESTABLISHES THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE FIRM. THE ASSESSMENTS OF OPERATIONAL RISK USING THIS FRAMEWORK ARE REVIEWED WITH THE DRPC.

RISK ASSESSMENT

THE FIRM UTILIZES SEVERAL TOOLS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MITIGATE AND MANAGE ITS OPERATIONAL RISK. ONE SUCH TOOL IS THE RCSA PROGRAM WHICH IS EXECUTED BY LOBS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINIMUM STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY ORG. AS PART OF THE RCSA PROGRAM, LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS IDENTIFY KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THEIR ACTIVITIES, EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RELEVANT

CONTROLS IN PLACE TO MITIGATE IDENTIFIED RISKS, AND DEFINE ACTIONS TO REDUCE RESIDUAL RISK. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR IDENTIFIED CONTROL ISSUES AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING ISSUES IN A TIMELY MANNER. OPERATIONAL RISK OFFICERS INDEPENDENTLY CHALLENGE THE EXECUTION OF THE RCSA PROGRAM AND EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE RESIDUAL RISK RESULTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE RCSA PROGRAM, THE FIRM TRACKS AND MONITORS EVENTS THAT HAVE OR COULD LEAD TO ACTUAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES, INCLUDING LITIGATION-RELATED EVENTS. RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS ANALYZE THEIR LOSSES TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THEIR CONTROL ENVIRONMENT TO ASSESS WHERE CONTROLS HAVE FAILED, AND TO DETERMINE WHERE TARGETED REMEDIATION EFFORTS MAY BE REQUIRED. ORG PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND MAY ALSO PERFORM INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS OF SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AND AREAS OF CONCENTRATED OR EMERGING RISK.

MEASUREMENT

IN ADDITION TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES, OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT INCLUDES OPERATIONAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES UNDER BOTH BASELINE AND STRESSED CONDITIONS.

THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL ESTIMATE IS THE LOSS DISTRIBUTION APPROACH (“LDA”) STATISTICAL MODEL, WHICH SIMULATES THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF FUTURE OPERATIONAL RISK LOSS PROJECTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA. THE LDA MODEL IS USED TO ESTIMATE AN AGGREGATE OPERATIONAL RISK LOSS OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON, AT A 99.9% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE LDA MODEL INCORPORATES ACTUAL INTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE LOSSES WERE REALIZED, AND THE CALCULATION GENERALLY CONTINUES TO REFLECT SUCH LOSSES EVEN AFTER THE ISSUES OR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES GIVING RISE TO THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN REMEDIATED OR REDUCED.

AS REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL METHODOLOGY, WHICH USES THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH, INCORPORATES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LOSSES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF TAIL RISK CAPTURED THROUGH OPERATIONAL RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS, AND EVALUATION OF KEY BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL METRICS.

THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF STRESSED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND DEVELOPS A FORWARD LOOKING VIEW OF MATERIAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK IS UTILIZED IN CALCULATING RESULTS FOR THE FIRM’S CCAR AND ICAAP PROCESSES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

MONITORING AND REPORTING

ORG HAS ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR CONSISTENT OPERATIONAL RISK REPORTING. THE STANDARDS ALSO REINFORCE ESCALATION PROTOCOLS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OPERATIONAL RISK REPORTS ARE PRODUCED ON A FIRMWIDE BASIS AS WELL AS BY LINE OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTION.

OTHER OPERATIONAL RISKS

AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS. RISKS SUCH AS COMPLIANCE RISK, CONDUCT RISK, LEGAL RISK AND MODEL RISK AS WELL AS OTHER OPERATIONAL RISKS, CAN LEAD TO LOSSES WHICH ARE CAPTURED THROUGH THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT PROCESSES

, RESPECTIVELY. DETAILS ON OTHER SELECT OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE PROVIDED BELOW.

CYBERSECURITY RISK

THE FIRM DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS. THE FIRM’S SECURITY EFFORTS ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT AGAINST CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENHANCING ITS CYBER DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AND TO STRENGTHEN ITS PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CYBERSECURITY RISKS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCE DEFENSES AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY AGAINST CYBERSECURITY THREATS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS OR THAT FACILITATE THE FIRM’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (E.G., VENDORS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING HOUSES, CENTRAL DEPOSITORIES, AND FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES) COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF CYBERSECURITY RISK TO THE FIRM. THIRD PARTY CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS SUCH AS SYSTEM BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES, MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PARTIES, OR CYBERATTACKS COULD AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO THE FIRM OR RESULT IN LOST OR COMPROMISED INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR ITS CLIENTS. CLIENTS CAN ALSO BE SOURCES OF CYBERSECURITY RISK TO THE FIRM, PARTICULARLY WHEN THEIR ACTIVITIES AND SYSTEMS ARE BEYOND THE FIRM’S OWN SECURITY AND CONTROL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, WHERE CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS ARE DUE TO CLIENT FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR OWN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, CLIENTS WILL GENERALLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES INCURRED.

TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THE FIRM’S INFRASTRUCTURE, RESOURCES AND INFORMATION, THE FIRM LEVERAGES THE ORMF TO ENSURE RISKS ARE IDENTIFIED AND MANAGED WITHIN DEFINED CORPORATE TOLERANCES. THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE ARE REGULARLY BRIEFED ON THE FIRM’S CYBERSECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS WELL AS ITS EFFORTS REGARDING SIGNIFICANT CYBERSECURITY EVENTS.

PAYMENT FRAUD RISK

PAYMENT FRAUD RISK IS THE RISK OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PARTIES UNLAWFULLY OBTAINING PERSONAL BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FIRM. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE RISK OF PAYMENT FRAUD HAS INCREASED ACROSS THE INDUSTRY, WITH THE NUMBER OF

ATTEMPTS HITTING RECORD HIGHS. THE COMPLEXITIES OF THESE ATTACKS ALONG WITH PERPETRATORS’ STRATEGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. A PAYMENTS CONTROL PROGRAM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT INCLUDES CYBERSECURITY, OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY, RISK AND THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE THE RISK, IMPLEMENT CONTROLS AND PROVIDE CLIENT EDUCATION AND AWARENESS TRAINING. THE PROGRAM MONITORS AND MEASURES PAYMENT FRAUD ACTIVITY, EVALUATES THE FIRM’S CYBERSECURITY DEFENSES, LIMITS ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DATA, AND PROVIDES TRAINING TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND CLIENTS.

THIRD-PARTY OUTSOURCING RISK

TO IDENTIFY AND MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISK INHERENT IN ITS OUTSOURCING ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM HAS A THIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT (“TPO”) FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST LINES OF BUSINESS AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS IN SELECTING, DOCUMENTING, ONBOARDING, MONITORING AND MANAGING THEIR SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE TPO FRAMEWORK IS TO HOLD THIRD PARTIES TO THE SAME HIGH LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AS IS EXPECTED OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL OPERATIONS.  THE THIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRMWIDE TPO TRAINING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND STANDARDS.

BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY RESILIENCE RISK

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS CAN OCCUR DUE TO FORCES BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL SUCH AS SEVERE WEATHER, POWER OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS LOSS, FLOODING, TRANSIT STRIKES, TERRORIST THREATS OR INFECTIOUS DISEASE. THE SAFETY OF THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS IS OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS (I.E., STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES) IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AWARENESS AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL INITIATIVES TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, AND MANAGE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND PUBLIC SAFETY RISKS.

THE STRENGTH AND PROFICIENCY OF THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM HAS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS DURING AND QUICKLY AFTER VARIOUS EVENTS.

INSURANCE

ONE OF THE WAYS OPERATIONAL LOSS MAY BE MITIGATED IS THROUGH INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM PURCHASES INSURANCE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS (E.G., WORKERS COMPENSATION), AS WELL AS TO SERVE OTHER NEEDS (E.G., PROPERTY LOSS AND PUBLIC LIABILITY). INSURANCE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE PURCHASED IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

REPUTATION RISK IS THE RISK THAT AN ACTION, TRANSACTION, INVESTMENT OR EVENT WILL REDUCE TRUST IN THE FIRM’S INTEGRITY OR COMPETENCE BY ITS VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS, INCLUDING CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, EMPLOYEES AND THE BROADER PUBLIC.

M

AINTAINING THE FIRM’S REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE OF THE FIRM. THE FIRM’S REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE POLICY EXPLICITLY VESTS EACH EMPLOYEE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSIDER THE REPUTATION OF THE FIRM WHEN ENGAGING IN ANY ACTIVITY. SINCE THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT COULD HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION ARE SO VARIED ACROSS THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS, EACH LINE OF BUSINESS HAS A SEPARATE REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE

INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE, WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE KEY ELEMENTS: CLEAR, DOCUMENTED ESCALATION CRITERIA APPROPRIATE TO THE BUSINESS; A DESIGNATED PRIMARY DISCUSSION FORUM — IN MOST CASES, ONE OR MORE DEDICATED REPUTATION RISK COMMITTEES; AND A LIST OF DESIGNATED CONTACTS, TO WHOM QUESTIONS RELATING TO REPUTATION RISK SHOULD BE REFERRED. LINE OF BUSINESS REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE IS OVERSEEN BY A FIRMWIDE REPUTATION RISK GOVERNANCE FUNCTION WHICH PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCESS TO SUPPORT THE CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION, ESCALATION, MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING OF REPUTATION RISK ISSUES FIRMWIDE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRM’S MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE APPROPRIATE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ESTIMATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE METHODS USED AND JUDGMENTS MADE REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE NATURE OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND THE RELATED BUSINESS AND RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRM’S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE RETAINED CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIRM’S LOAN ASSETS TO REFLECT PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SIMILARLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS ESTABLISHED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDES A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS. THE DETERMINATION OF EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ON A NUMBER OF MATTERS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE COMPONENTS, AREAS OF JUDGMENT AND METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SENSITIVITY

THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS SENSITIVE TO NUMEROUS FACTORS, WHICH MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE PORTFOLIO. CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR IN THE FIRM’S ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD AFFECT ITS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE FIRM USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ASSESS THESE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LOSS DATA IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THESE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REFINEMENT BASED ON CHANGES TO UNDERLYING EXTERNAL OR FIRM-SPECIFIC HISTORICAL DATA. THE USE OF ALTERNATE ESTIMATES, DATA SOURCES, ADJUSTMENTS TO MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES FOR MODEL IMPRECISION AND OTHER FACTORS WOULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TO ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL MAGNITUDE OF CERTAIN ALTERNATE JUDGMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING INPUTS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE FIRM’S MODELED CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF ANY OFFSETTING OR CORRELATED EFFECTS OF OTHER INPUTS IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

$2.3 BILLION.

•

A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LGD FOR THE FIRM’S ENTIRE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO COULD IMPLY AN INCREASE IN THE FIRM’S MODELED CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES OF APPROXIMATELY

$175 MILLION.

THE PURPOSE OF THESE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE ISOLATED IMPACTS OF HYPOTHETICAL ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ON MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES. THE CHANGES IN THE INPUTS PRESENTED ABOVE ARE NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION OF THOSE RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION, THESE ANALYSES ARE NOT INTENDED TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY THE JUDGMENT MANAGEMENT APPLIES TO THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY AND IMPRECISION OF THESE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SPECIFIC FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT THE OVERALL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF FACTORS AND INPUTS IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS AND INPUTS MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME RATE AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES, AND CHANGES IN FACTORS MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT, SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN OTHER FACTORS. IN ADDITION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW CHANGES IN SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT BORROWER BEHAVIOR OR OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM

FOLLOWS AND THE JUDGMENTS MADE IN EVALUATING THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO ITS LOSS ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS APPROPRIATE.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS, WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

PRIVATE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITHIN CORPORATE.

VALUATION

DETAILS OF THE FIRM’S PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE ARE SET OUT IN NOTE 3. ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM. FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INPUTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED, SEE

NOTE 3.

FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM’S CREDITWORTHINESS, MARKET FUNDING RATES, LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS APPLIED BY THE FIRM SEE NOTE 3.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS DIFFERENT THAN THOSE USED BY THE FIRM COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS AND HIERARCHY, AND ITS DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 3.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER U.S. GAAP, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE FIRM’S PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY USED TO CONDUCT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ESTIMATES OF (A) THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, (B) LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES AND (C) THE ESTIMATED MARKET COST OF EQUITY. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS.

BASED UPON THE UPDATED VALUATIONS FOR ALL OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES BY APPROXIMATELY 10% - 130% FOR ALL

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

133

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

REPORTING UNITS AND DID NOT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND VALUATIONS.

THE PROJECTIONS FOR ALL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT SHORT-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS, AND IN THE LONGER TERM, INCORPORATE A SET OF MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND THE FIRM’S BEST ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH AND RETURNS ON EQUITY OF ITS BUSINESSES. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES THIRD-PARTY AND PEER DATA TO BENCHMARK ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES.

DECLINES IN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, INCREASES IN CREDIT LOSSES, INCREASES IN EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS, ADVERSE ESTIMATES OF REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED MARKET COST OF EQUITY, COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 17.

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS, AS WELL AS MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN ITEMS MAY AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND EXAMINATION BY THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FIRM OPERATES, AND DISPUTES MAY OCCUR REGARDING ITS VIEW ON A TAX POSITION. THESE DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED BY AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OR ADJUDICATION IN THE COURT SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS WHETHER IT MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS, AND THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS, LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS, AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVISIONS IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

THE FIRM’S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPOSED OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES. DEFERRED TAXES ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING VERSUS INCOME TAX RETURN PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IF, IN MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT, THEIR REALIZABILITY IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NOLS AND TAX CREDITS. THE FIRM

PERFORMS REGULAR REVIEWS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH ALSO INCORPORATES VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING STRATEGIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE NOLS BEFORE THEY EXPIRE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REVIEWS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT REALIZABLE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REVERSED IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD IF THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT, BASED ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OR CHANGES IN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BECOME REALIZABLE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT RECORD U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN A FUTURE PERIOD IF SUCH CHANGES WERE TO OCCUR.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD ARE MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE. AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REASSESSMENT OCCURS.

•  ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2016.

•  THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS THE FIRM HAS HISTORICALLY MEASURED THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE MORE OBSERVABLE FAIR VALUE.

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES – DVA TO OCI

•  FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED, THE PORTION OF THE TOTAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK (I.E., DVA) IS REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN OCI.

•  REQUIRES A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.

•  ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2016.

•  THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUMMARY OF GUIDANCE

EFFECTS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REVENUE RECOGNITION – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

ISSUED MAY 2014

•  REQUIRES THAT REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS BE RECOGNIZED UPON TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF A GOOD OR SERVICE IN THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED.

•  CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN CONTRACT COSTS, INCLUDING WHETHER THEY MAY BE OFFSET AGAINST REVENUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT REVENUE AND CONTRACT COSTS.

•  MAY BE ADOPTED USING A FULL RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH OR A MODIFIED, CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH WHEREIN THE GUIDANCE IS APPLIED ONLY TO EXISTING CONTRACTS AS OF THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION, AND TO NEW CONTRACTS TRANSACTED AFTER THAT DATE.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2018.

(A)

•  BECAUSE THE GUIDANCE DOES NOT APPLY TO REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING LOANS AND SECURITIES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER OTHER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE ELEMENTS OF ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING SECURITIES GAINS, INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

•  THE FIRM PLANS TO ADOPT THE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. THE FIRM’S IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION OF REVENUE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS THE EVALUATION OF REVENUE CONTRACTS AND RELATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WHILE THE FIRM HAS NOT YET IDENTIFIED ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE FIRM’S REVIEW IS ONGOING, AND IT CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACT COSTS (WHETHER PRESENTED GROSS OR OFFSET AGAINST NONINTEREST REVENUE).

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

ISSUED JANUARY 2016

•  REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

•  GENERALLY REQUIRES A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD OF ADOPTION.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2018.

•  THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FIRM’S IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION OF SECURITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GUIDANCE, THE EVALUATION OF THE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE FOR EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE, AND THE RELATED IMPACT TO ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURES.

LEASES

ISSUED FEBRUARY 2016

•  REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE ALL LEASES LONGER THAN TWELVE MONTHS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS LEASE LIABILITIES WITH CORRESPONDING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS.

•  REQUIRES LESSEES AND LESSORS TO CLASSIFY MOST LEASES USING PRINCIPLES SIMILAR TO EXISTING LEASE ACCOUNTING, BUT ELIMINATES THE “BRIGHT LINE” CLASSIFICATION TESTS.

•  EXPANDS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING LEASING ARRANGEMENTS.

•  REQUIRES ADOPTION USING A MODIFIED CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH WHEREIN THE GUIDANCE IS APPLIED TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2019.

(A)

•  THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY REVIEWING ITS EXISTING LEASE CONTRACTS AND SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT MAY INCLUDE EMBEDDED LEASES. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE LEASE LIABILITIES AND CORRESPONDING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (AT THEIR PRESENT VALUE) RELATED TO PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE $10 BILLION OF FUTURE MINIMUM PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER OPERATING LEASES AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 30. HOWEVER, THE POPULATION OF CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO BALANCE SHEET RECOGNITION AND THEIR INITIAL MEASUREMENT REMAINS UNDER EVALUATION. THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE EXPENSE IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

SUMMARY OF GUIDANCE

EFFECTS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES

ISSUED JUNE 2016

•  REPLACES EXISTING INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE AND ESTABLISHES A SINGLE ALLOWANCE FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST (INCLUDING HTM SECURITIES), WHICH WILL REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE FULL REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSETS.

•  ELIMINATES EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR PCI LOANS, AND REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS PURCHASED WITH MORE THAN INSIGNIFICANT CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE ORIGINATION.

•  AMENDS EXISTING IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE FOR AFS SECURITIES TO INCORPORATE AN ALLOWANCE, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR REVERSALS OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN THE EVENT THAT THE CREDIT OF AN ISSUER IMPROVES.

•  REQUIRES A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD OF ADOPTION.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2020.

(B)

•  THE FIRM HAS BEGUN ITS IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS BY ESTABLISHING A FIRMWIDE, CROSS-DISCIPLINE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.  THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY IDENTIFYING KEY INTERPRETIVE ISSUES, AND IS ASSESSING EXISTING CREDIT LOSS FORECASTING MODELS AND PROCESSES AGAINST THE NEW GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE WHAT MODIFICATIONS MAY BE REQUIRED.

•  THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING.

1.

THE ALLOWANCE RELATED TO THE FIRM’S LOANS AND COMMITMENTS WILL INCREASE TO COVER CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE FULL REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO, AND WILL CONSIDER EXPECTED FUTURE CHANGES IN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS

2.

THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE ON PCI LOANS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS AN ALLOWANCE, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED LOANS

3.

AN ALLOWANCE WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON HTM SECURITIES

•  THE EXTENT OF THE INCREASE IS UNDER EVALUATION, BUT WILL DEPEND UPON THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIO AT THE ADOPTION DATE, AND THE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND FORECASTS AT THAT DATE.

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

ISSUED AUGUST 2016

•  PROVIDES TARGETED AMENDMENTS TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING TREATMENT OF CASH PAYMENTS FOR SETTLEMENT OF ZERO-COUPON DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

•  REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2018.

(A)

•  THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TREATMENT OF RESTRICTED CASH ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

ISSUED NOVEMBER 2016

•  REQUIRES INCLUSION OF RESTRICTED CASH IN THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

•  REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO SUPPLEMENT THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

•  REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2018.

(A)

•  THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS

ISSUED JANUARY 2017

•  NARROWS THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS AND CLARIFIES THAT, TO BE CONSIDERED A BUSINESS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROSS ASSETS ACQUIRED (OR DISPOSED OF) MAY NOT BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE IDENTIFIABLE ASSET OR A GROUP OF SIMILAR ASSETS.

•  IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A BUSINESS, A SET OF ACTIVITIES AND ASSETS MUST INCLUDE, AT A MINIMUM, AN INPUT AND A SUBSTANTIVE PROCESS THAT TOGETHER SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABILITY TO CREATE OUTPUTS.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2018.

(A)

•  NO MATERIAL IMPACT IS EXPECTED BECAUSE THE GUIDANCE IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, ALTHOUGH IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AFTER ADOPTION, FEWER TRANSACTIONS WILL BE TREATED AS ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS OF A BUSINESS.

GOODWILL

ISSUED JANUARY 2017

•  REQUIRES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT FALLS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

•  ELIMINATES THE SECOND CONDITION IN THE CURRENT GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE ESTIMATED IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

•  REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE: JANUARY 1, 2020.

(A)

•  BASED ON CURRENT IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS, THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

•  AFTER ADOPTION, THE GUIDANCE MAY RESULT IN MORE FREQUENT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES DUE TO THE REMOVAL OF THE SECOND CONDITION.

(A)

EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.

(B)

EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED ON JANUARY 1, 2019.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

DECEMBER 31, 2016

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE FIRM MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING”. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“

JPMORGAN CHASE

” OR THE “FIRM”), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S., WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 33.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

U.S. GAAP.

ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE FIRM

HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY

THE FIRM

ARE NOT ASSETS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FIRM

DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016,

THE FIRM

ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF LEGAL ENTITIES SUCH AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATIONS, AND SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES. THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATED THE DEFERRAL ISSUED BY THE

FASB

IN FEBRUARY 2010 OF THE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR VIES FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS. IN ADDITION, THE GUIDANCE AMENDS THE EVALUATION OF FEES PAID TO A DECISION-MAKER OR A SERVICE PROVIDER, AND EXEMPTS CERTAIN MONEY MARKET FUNDS FROM CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE, ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS STRUCTURED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR CERTAIN LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES ARE NOW EVALUATED FOR CONSOLIDATION AS VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES IF THE NON-MANAGING PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE

THE FIRM

AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER WITHOUT CAUSE (I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS) BASED ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE, OR THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES. HOWEVER, IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NON-MANAGING PARTNERS OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUT OR PARTICIPATING RIGHTS,

THE FIRM

EVALUATES THE FUNDS AS VIES AND CONSOLIDATES IF IT IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER AND HAS A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AND PROVIDE THE EQUITY INVESTORS VOTING RIGHTS THAT ENABLE THEM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS. FOR THESE TYPES OF ENTITIES,

THE FIRM’S

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS HELD. ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE FIRM

HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITIES’ VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS, OR THROUGH OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE

THE FIRM

CONTROL, ARE CONSOLIDATED BY

THE FIRM.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN WHICH

THE FIRM

HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS (BUT DOES NOT OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR (I) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (WHICH REQUIRES

THE FIRM

TO RECOGNIZE ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITY’S NET EARNINGS), OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

CERTAIN

FIRM

-SPONSORED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES.

FOR MANY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE FIRM IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER, BUT THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER WITHOUT CAUSE (I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS), BASED ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE, OR THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NONAFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUT OR PARTICIPATING RIGHTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE FUNDS.

THE FIRM’S

INVESTMENT COMPANIES HAVE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLICLY-HELD AND PRIVATELY-HELD ENTITIES

, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES.

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES AND ACCORDINGLY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTERESTS HELD, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, AND ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT, BY DESIGN, EITHER (1) LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2) HAVE EQUITY INVESTORS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS, OR DO NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE EXPECTED LOSSES, OR DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY.

146

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS A

N SPE.

SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPE’S INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPE’S ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE (I.E., THE PARTY THAT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST) IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS THE PARTY THAT HAS BOTH (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND (2) THROUGH ITS INTERESTS IN THE VIE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER

THE FIRM

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ITS ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE VIE AND ITS ONGOING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDES, FIRST, IDENTIFYING THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND SECOND, IDENTIFYING WHICH PARTY, IF ANY, HAS POWER OVER THOSE ACTIVITIES. IN GENERAL, THE PARTIES THAT MAKE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE VIE (SUCH AS ASSET MANAGERS, COLLATERAL MANAGERS, SERVICERS, OR OWNERS OF CALL OPTIONS OR LIQUIDATION RIGHTS OVER THE VIE’S ASSETS) OR HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY REMOVE THOSE DECISION-MAKERS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER

THE FIRM

HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SERVICING FEES, AND DERIVATIVES OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THE VIE. THIS ASSESSMENT REQUIRES THAT

THE FIRM

APPLY JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THESE INTERESTS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ARE CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDE: THE DESIGN OF THE VIE, INCLUDING ITS CAPITALIZATION STRUCTURE; SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS; PAYMENT PRIORITY; RELATIVE SHARE OF INTERESTS HELD ACROSS VARIOUS CLASSES WITHIN THE VIE’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE; AND THE REASONS WHY THE INTERESTS ARE HELD BY

THE FIRM.

THE FIRM

PERFORMS ON-GOING REASSESSMENTS OF: (1) WHETHER ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED UNDER THE MAJORITY VOTING-INTEREST FRAMEWORK HAVE BECOME VIES, BASED ON CERTAIN EVENTS, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE VIE CONSOLIDATION FRAMEWORK; AND (2) WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING

THE FIRM’S

INVOLVEMENT WITH A VIE CAUSE

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATION CONCLUSION TO CHANGE.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE

REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S. REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN

OCI WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS’

EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

U.S. GAAP PERMITS ENTITIES TO PRESENT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON A NET BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. U.S. GAAP ALSO PERMITS SECURITIES SOLD AND PURCHASED UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO BE PRESENTED NET WHEN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET, INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT.

THE FIRM

HAS ELECTED TO NET SUCH BALANCES WHEN THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET.

THE FIRM

USES MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS

TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS, REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED AGREEMENTS. A MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT IS A SINGLE CONTRACT WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT PERMITS MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THAT CONTRACT TO BE TERMINATED AND SETTLED THROUGH A SINGLE PAYMENT IN A SINGLE CURRENCY IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY, FAILURE TO MAKE A REQUIRED PAYMENT OR SECURITIES TRANSFER OR DELIVER COLLATERAL OR MARGIN WHEN DUE AFTER EXPIRATION OF ANY GRACE PERIOD). UPON THE EXERCISE OF TERMINATION RIGHTS BY THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY (I) ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE TERMINATED, (II) ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE VALUED AND THE POSITIVE VALUE OR “IN THE MONEY” TRANSACTIONS ARE NETTED AGAINST THE NEGATIVE VALUE OR “OUT OF THE MONEY” TRANSACTIONS AND (III) THE ONLY REMAINING PAYMENT OBLIGATION IS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES TO PAY THE NETTED TERMINATION AMOUNT. UPON EXERCISE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES LOAN DEFAULT RIGHTS IN GENERAL (I) ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE TERMINATED AND ACCELERATED, (II) ALL VALUES OF SECURITIES OR CASH HELD OR TO BE DELIVERED ARE CALCULATED, AND ALL SUCH SUMS ARE NETTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND (III) THE ONLY REMAINING PAYMENT OBLIGATION IS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES TO PAY THE NETTED TERMINATION AMOUNT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

147

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TYPICAL MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS ALSO OFTEN CONTAIN A COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A SECURITY INTEREST IN, OR TITLE TRANSFER OF, SECURITIES OR CASH COLLATERAL/MARGIN TO THE PARTY THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND MARGIN (THE “DEMANDING PARTY”). THE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT TYPICALLY REQUIRES A PARTY TO TRANSFER COLLATERAL/MARGIN TO THE DEMANDING PARTY WITH A VALUE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE MARGIN DEFICIT ON A NET BASIS ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONS GOVERNED BY THE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT, LESS ANY THRESHOLD. THE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AGREEMENT GRANTS TO THE DEMANDING PARTY, UPON DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY, THE RIGHT TO SET-OFF ANY AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY THE COUNTERPARTY AGAINST ANY POSTED COLLATERAL OR THE CASH EQUIVALENT OF ANY POSTED COLLATERAL/MARGIN. IT ALSO GRANTS TO THE DEMANDING PARTY THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE COLLATERAL/MARGIN AND TO APPLY THE PROCEEDS TO AN AMOUNT PAYABLE BY THE COUNTERPARTY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE

CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS (I.E., ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS). CERTAIN ASSETS (E.G., CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL), LIABILITIES AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS; THAT IS, THEY ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT).

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR INPUTS, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS MATURITY) AND USE AS INPUTS OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE LEVEL OF PRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE

THE FIRM

BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM

USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH THOSE USED BY

THE FIRM

COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION PROCESS

RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM’S VCG,

WHICH IS PART OF

THE FIRM’S

FINANCE FUNCTION AND INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THESE ESTIMATES AND DETERMINING ANY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT

THE FIRM’S

POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE VGF

IS COMPOSED OF SENIOR FINANCE AND RISK EXECUTIVES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM VALUATION ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED ACROSS

THE FIRM.

THE VGF IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRMWIDE HEAD OF THE VCG (UNDER THE DIRECTION OF

THE FIRM’S CONTROLLER)

, AND INCLUDES SUB-FORUMS COVERING THE

CIB, CCB, CB, AWM

AND CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING TREASURY AND

CIO.

PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS

THE VCG VERIFIES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS BY LEVERAGING INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED PRICES, VALUATION INPUTS AND OTHER MARKET DATA, WHERE AVAILABLE. WHERE INDEPENDENT PRICES OR INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE VCG PERFORMS ADDITIONAL REVIEW TO ENSURE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATES. THE ADDITIONAL REVIEW MAY INCLUDE EVALUATING THE LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY INCLUDING CLIENT UNWINDS, BENCHMARKING VALUATION INPUTS TO THOSE USED FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, DECOMPOSING THE VALUATION OF STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS, COMPARING EXPECTED TO ACTUAL CASH FLOWS, REVIEWING PROFIT AND LOSS TRENDS, AND REVIEWING TRENDS IN COLLATERAL VALUATION. THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT OR COMPLEX POSITIONS.

THE VCG DETERMINES ANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO THE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS. NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY (SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY). FOR OTHER POSITIONS, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND, FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE DETERMINATION OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS FOLLOWS A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS

THE FIRM.

•

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED WHERE AN OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL PRICE OR VALUATION PARAMETER EXISTS BUT IS OF LOWER RELIABILITY, POTENTIALLY DUE TO LOWER MARKET ACTIVITY. LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED AND DETERMINED BASED ON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF: (1) THE ESTIMATED BID-OFFER SPREAD FOR THE INSTRUMENT BEING TRADED; (2) ALTERNATIVE PRICING POINTS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; AND (3) THE RANGE OF REASONABLE VALUES THAT THE PRICE OR PARAMETER COULD TAKE.

•

THE FIRM

MANAGES CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON THE BASIS OF NET OPEN RISK EXPOSURE AND, AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, HAS ELECTED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH PORTFOLIOS ON THE BASIS OF A TRANSFER OF THE ENTIRE NET OPEN RISK POSITION IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION. WHERE THIS IS THE CASE, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING A LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. WHERE APPLIED, SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE BASED ON FACTORS THAT A RELEVANT MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN THE TRANSFER OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION TO A NORMAL MARKET-SIZE.

•

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING PRICES OR INPUT PARAMETERS TO VALUATION MODELS THAT ARE UNOBSERVABLE DUE TO A LACK OF MARKET ACTIVITY OR BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BE IMPLIED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. SUCH PRICES OR PARAMETERS MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE RESULTING VALUATION ESTIMATE.

•

WHERE APPROPRIATE,

THE FIRM

ALSO APPLIES ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY (CVA),

THE FIRM’S

OWN CREDITWORTHINESS (DVA) AND THE IMPACT OF FUNDING (FVA), USING A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS

THE FIRM.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SUCH ADJUSTMENTS SEE CREDIT AND FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS ON

PAGE 164

OF THIS NOTE.

VALUATION MODEL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

IF PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR AN INSTRUMENT OR A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT, FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING VALUATION MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION DATA SUCH AS MATURITY AND USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS. WHERE THIS IS THE CASE THE PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS APPLIED TO THE INPUTS TO THOSE MODELS.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION REVIEWS AND APPROVES A WIDE RANGE OF MODELS, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT, VALUATION, AND REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS USED BY

THE FIRM.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION IS INDEPENDENT OF MODEL USERS AND DEVELOPERS. THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK EXECUTIVE REPORTS TO

THE FIRM’S CRO.

WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY, AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION REVIEWS AND APPROVES NEW MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION IN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE HEAD OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION MAY GRANT EXCEPTIONS TO

THE FIRM’S

MODEL RISK POLICY TO ALLOW A MODEL TO BE USED PRIOR TO REVIEW OR APPROVAL. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE USER TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE MODEL RISK IF IT IS TO BE USED IN THE INTERIM.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER U.S. GAAP FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.

•

LEVEL 1 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

•

LEVEL 2 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

•

LEVEL 3 – ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT’S CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. “MARKET” IS A TERM DEFINED IN U.S. GAAP AS NOT EXCEEDING FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL (“TRANSACTION COSTS”). TRANSACTION COSTS FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE EITHER NOT APPLICABLE OR IMMATERIAL TO THE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY. THEREFORE, MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. WHEN FAIR VALUE HEDGING HAS BEEN APPLIED (OR WHEN MARKET IS BELOW COST), THE CARRYING VALUE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE, BECAUSE UNDER FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE COST BASIS IS ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS, SEE NOTE 6. TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE INFORMATION, ALL PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EACH PERIOD PRESENTED.

FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT REDUCE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BALANCES FOR THIS NETTING ADJUSTMENT, EITHER WITHIN OR ACROSS THE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS SUCH NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE LEVEL 3 BALANCES WOULD BE REDUCED IF NETTING WERE APPLIED, INCLUDING THE NETTING BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH CASH COLLATERAL.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS

THE FIRM

HAS ESTABLISHED WELL-STRUCTURED PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING FOR INSTRUMENTS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON

THE FIRM’S

VALUATION PROCESS AND A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE

PAGES 150–153

OF THIS NOTE.

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

THE FIRM.

FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEED, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS

THE FIRM’S

PRIMARY LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR THOSE INPUTS AND, FOR CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF SUCH INPUTS. WHILE THE DETERMINATION TO CLASSIFY AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3 IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES) IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE COMPONENTS. THE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM

MANAGES THE RISK OF THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

THE RANGE OF VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST LEVEL INPUT USED TO VALUE THE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT/INSTRUMENT CLASSIFICATION. WHERE PROVIDED, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THE INPUT VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS THAT THE INPUT IS BEING USED TO VALUE.

IN

THE FIRM’S

VIEW, THE INPUT RANGE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUE DO NOT REFLECT THE DEGREE OF INPUT UNCERTAINTY OR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REASONABLENESS OF

THE FIRM’S

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. RATHER, THEY REFLECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS HELD BY

THE FIRM

AND THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OPTION CONTRACTS MAY HAVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND VALUATION UNCERTAINTY, BUT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IMPLIED VOLATILITY LEVELS BECAUSE THE OPTION CONTRACTS HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYINGS, TENORS, OR STRIKE PRICES. THE INPUT RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUES WILL THEREFORE VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND PARAMETER-TO-PARAMETER BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENTS HELD BY

THE FIRM

AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE.

FOR

THE FIRM’S

DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

INTEREST RATE CORRELATION INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE CONCENTRATED TOWARDS THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED; EQUITY CORRELATION INPUTS WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE;

THE CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE RANGE PRESENTED; AND THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CORRELATION INPUTS WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE RANGE PRESENTED; EQUITY VOLATILITIES WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE LOWER HALF END OF THE RANGE; AND FORWARD COMMODITY PRICES USED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY DERIVATIVES WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RANGE PRESENTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

CHANGES IN AND RANGES OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT ON A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF A CHANGE IN EACH UNOBSERVABLE INPUT IN ISOLATION, AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, WHERE RELEVANT AND SIGNIFICANT. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INPUTS MAY NOT BE INDEPENDENT, AS A CHANGE IN ONE UNOBSERVABLE INPUT MAY GIVE RISE TO A CHANGE IN ANOTHER UNOBSERVABLE INPUT. WHERE RELATIONSHIPS DO EXIST BETWEEN TWO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. RELATIONSHIPS MAY ALSO EXIST BETWEEN OBSERVABLE AND UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (FOR EXAMPLE, AS OBSERVABLE INTEREST RATES RISE, UNOBSERVABLE PREPAYMENT RATES DECLINE); SUCH RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW. IN ADDITION, FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WOULD ALSO GENERALLY APPLY.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ALSO PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AND EXTERNAL MARKET FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RANGE OF INPUTS USED IN THE VALUATION OF

THE FIRM’S

POSITIONS.

YIELD – THE YIELD OF AN ASSET IS THE INTEREST RATE USED TO DISCOUNT FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. AN INCREASE IN THE YIELD, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CREDIT SPREAD – THE CREDIT SPREAD IS THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL ANNUALIZED RETURN OVER THE MARKET INTEREST RATE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD DEMAND FOR TAKING EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF AN INSTRUMENT. THE CREDIT SPREAD FOR AN INSTRUMENT FORMS PART OF THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. GENERALLY, AN INCREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE YIELD AND THE CREDIT SPREAD OF A PARTICULAR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY PRIMARILY REFLECT THE RISK INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT. THE YIELD IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF THE COUPON PAID BY THE INSTRUMENT (WHICH MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK). THEREFORE, THE RANGE OF YIELD AND CREDIT SPREADS REFLECTS THE RANGE OF RISK INHERENT IN VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY

THE FIRM.

THE RISK INHERENT IN MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IS DRIVEN BY THE SUBORDINATION OF THE SECURITY BEING VALUED AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES WITHIN THE COLLATERALIZED POOL, INCLUDING BORROWER FICO SCORES,

LTV

RATIOS FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND THE NATURE OF THE PROPERTY AND/OR ANY TENANTS FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. FOR CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, CREDIT SPREADS REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE OBLIGOR AND THE TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION.

PREPAYMENT SPEED – THE PREPAYMENT SPEED IS A MEASURE OF THE VOLUNTARY UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF A PREPAYABLE OBLIGATION IN A COLLATERALIZED POOL. PREPAYMENT SPEEDS GENERALLY DECLINE AS BORROWER DELINQUENCIES RISE. AN INCREASE IN PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A PREMIUM TO PAR AND AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A DISCOUNT TO PAR.

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS MAY VARY FROM COLLATERAL POOL TO COLLATERAL POOL, AND ARE DRIVEN BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF THE UNDERLYING BORROWER, AND THE REMAINING TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE LEVEL AND TYPE (E.G., FIXED OR FLOATING) OF INTEREST RATE BEING PAID BY THE BORROWER. TYPICALLY COLLATERAL POOLS WITH HIGHER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY HAVE A HIGHER PREPAYMENT RATE THAN THOSE WITH LOWER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY, ALL OTHER FACTORS BEING EQUAL.

CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE – THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE IS A MEASURE OF THE REDUCTION IN THE OUTSTANDING COLLATERAL BALANCE UNDERLYING A COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATION AS A RESULT OF DEFAULTS. WHILE THERE IS TYPICALLY NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL HAS HIGH PREPAYMENT SPEEDS WILL TEND TO HAVE LOWER CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES WOULD GENERALLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY AND AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS. AN INCREASE IN THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING A SECURITIZATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION ITSELF. BASED ON THE TYPES OF SECURITIES OWNED IN

THE FIRM’S

MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS, CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES ARE MOST TYPICALLY AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED.

LOSS SEVERITY – THE LOSS SEVERITY (THE INVERSE CONCEPT IS THE RECOVERY RATE) IS THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FUTURE REALIZED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE ULTIMATE LIQUIDATION OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, EXPRESSED AS THE NET AMOUNT OF LOSS RELATIVE TO THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE. AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY IS GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN THE LOSS SEVERITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LOSS SEVERITY APPLIED IN VALUING A MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY INVESTMENT DEPENDS ON FACTORS RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES, INCLUDING THE LTV RATIO, THE NATURE OF THE LENDER’S LIEN ON THE PROPERTY AND OTHER INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

159

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CORRELATION – CORRELATION IS A MEASURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF TWO VARIABLES (E.G., HOW THE CHANGE IN ONE VARIABLE INFLUENCES THE CHANGE IN THE OTHER). CORRELATION IS A PRICING INPUT FOR A DERIVATIVE PRODUCT WHERE THE PAYOFF IS DRIVEN BY ONE OR MORE UNDERLYING RISKS. CORRELATION INPUTS ARE RELATED TO THE TYPE OF DERIVATIVE

(E.G., INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, EQUITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE)

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. GIVEN A SHORT CORRELATION POSITION, AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. THE RANGE OF CORRELATION INPUTS BETWEEN RISKS WITHIN THE SAME ASSET CLASS ARE GENERALLY NARROWER THAN THOSE BETWEEN UNDERLYING RISKS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, THE RANGES OF CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS TEND TO BE NARROWER THAN THOSE AFFECTING OTHER ASSET CLASSES.

THE LEVEL OF CORRELATION USED IN THE VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES WITH MULTIPLE UNDERLYING RISKS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THOSE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THAT BETWEEN TWO INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES. SIMILARLY, THE TENOR OF THE TRANSACTION MAY ALSO IMPACT THE CORRELATION INPUT, AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING RISKS MAY BE DIFFERENT OVER DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. FURTHERMORE, CORRELATION LEVELS ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COULD HAVE A RELATIVELY WIDE RANGE OF LEVELS WITHIN OR ACROSS ASSET CLASSES OVER TIME, PARTICULARLY IN VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

VOLATILITY – VOLATILITY IS A MEASURE OF THE VARIABILITY IN POSSIBLE RETURNS FOR AN INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR MARKET INDEX GIVEN HOW MUCH THE PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR INDEX CHANGES IN VALUE OVER TIME. VOLATILITY IS A PRICING INPUT FOR OPTIONS, INCLUDING EQUITY OPTIONS, COMMODITY OPTIONS, AND INTEREST RATE OPTIONS. GENERALLY, THE HIGHER THE VOLATILITY OF THE UNDERLYING, THE RISKIER THE INSTRUMENT. GIVEN A LONG POSITION IN AN OPTION, AN INCREASE IN VOLATILITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LEVEL OF VOLATILITY USED IN THE VALUATION OF A PARTICULAR OPTION-BASED DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE RISK UNDERLYING THE OPTION (E.G., THE VOLATILITY OF A PARTICULAR EQUITY SECURITY MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A PARTICULAR COMMODITY INDEX), THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVE AS WELL AS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE OPTION.

EBITDA MULTIPLE – EBITDA MULTIPLES REFER TO THE INPUT (OFTEN DERIVED FROM THE VALUE OF A COMPARABLE COMPANY) THAT IS MULTIPLIED BY THE HISTORIC AND/OR EXPECTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (“EBITDA”) OF A COMPANY IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COMPANY’S VALUE. AN INCREASE IN THE EBITDA MULTIPLE, IN ISOLATION, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS, WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A ROLLFORWARD OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AMOUNTS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE) FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY

THE FIRM

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

2015

AND

2014.

WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE DETERMINATION IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO,

THE FIRM

RISK-MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY; AS THESE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES DO NOT REFLECT THE EFFECT OF

THE FIRM’S

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO SUCH LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS.

CREDIT AND FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS – DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVES ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. THESE MARKET PARAMETERS GENERALLY DO NOT CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY NONPERFORMANCE RISK, THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT QUALITY, AND FUNDING COSTS. THEREFORE, IT IS GENERALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BASE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE TO REFLECT THESE FACTORS.

CVA REPRESENTS THE ADJUSTMENT, RELATIVE TO THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, NECESSARY TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY NONPERFORMANCE RISK. THE FIRM ESTIMATES CVA USING A SCENARIO ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED CREDIT EXPOSURE ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRM’S POSITIONS WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY, AND THEN ESTIMATES LOSSES AS A RESULT OF A COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EVENT. THE KEY INPUTS TO THIS METHODOLOGY ARE (I) THE EXPECTED POSITIVE EXPOSURE TO EACH COUNTERPARTY BASED ON A SIMULATION THAT ASSUMES THE CURRENT POPULATION OF EXISTING DERIVATIVES WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY REMAINS UNCHANGED AND CONSIDERS CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE FIRM’S CREDIT EXPOSURE, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF OFFSET; (II) THE PROBABILITY OF A DEFAULT EVENT OCCURRING FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY, AS DERIVED FROM OBSERVED OR ESTIMATED CDS SPREADS; AND (III) ESTIMATED RECOVERY RATES IMPLIED BY CDS SPREADS, ADJUSTED TO CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES IN RECOVERY RATES AS A DERIVATIVE CREDITOR RELATIVE TO THOSE REFLECTED IN CDS SPREADS, WHICH GENERALLY REFLECT SENIOR UNSECURED CREDITOR RISK.

DVA REPRESENTS THE ADJUSTMENT, RELATIVE TO THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM. THE DERIVATIVE DVA CALCULATION METHODOLOGY IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE CVA METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED ABOVE AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED THROUGH THE CDS MARKET TO ESTIMATE THE PD AND LGD AS A RESULT OF A SYSTEMIC EVENT AFFECTING THE FIRM.

FVA REPRESENTS THE ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF FUNDING AND IS RECOGNIZED WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET WOULD INCORPORATE IT IN A TRANSFER OF THE INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM’S FVA FRAMEWORK, APPLIED TO UNCOLLATERALIZED (INCLUDING PARTIALLY COLLATERALIZED) OTC DERIVATIVES, LEVERAGES ITS EXISTING CVA AND DVA CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES, AND CONSIDERS THE FACT THAT THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF FUNDING COSTS.

164

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

THE KEY INPUTS TO FVA ARE: (I) THE EXPECTED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM THE FIRM’S POSITIONS WITH EACH COUNTERPARTY AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS; (II) FOR ASSETS, THE ESTIMATED MARKET FUNDING COST IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET; AND (III) FOR LIABILITIES, THE HYPOTHETICAL MARKET FUNDING COST FOR A TRANSFER TO A MARKET PARTICIPANT WITH A SIMILAR CREDIT STANDING AS THE FIRM. FOR COLLATERALIZED DERIVATIVES, THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AT THE RELEVANT OVERNIGHT INDEXED SWAP RATE GIVEN THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, AND THEREFORE A SEPARATE FVA IS NOT NECESSARY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE IMPACT OF CREDIT AND FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS ON PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE IN THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY ASSOCIATED HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE DVA AND FVA REPORTED BELOW INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT QUALITY ON THE INCEPTION VALUE OF LIABILITIES AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT QUALITY OVER TIME.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ON FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTED LIABILITIES

THE VALUATION OF THE FIRM’S LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK. DVA ON FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTED LIABILITIES IS MEASURED USING (I) THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY AND (II) CHANGES (SUBSEQUENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE LIABILITY) IN THE FIRM’S PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LGD, WHICH ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREAD OBSERVED IN THE BOND MARKET. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, THE EFFECT OF DVA ON FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTED LIABILITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN OCI. SEE NOTE 25 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

JPMORGAN CHASE’S

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE FIRM

HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE,

BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE, COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, SECURITIES LOANED AND SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE; RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT PERMITTED.

FAIR VALUE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT INCORPORATES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE AND CONTRACTUAL FEES) AND OTHER KEY INPUTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, AND PRIMARY ORIGINATION OR SECONDARY MARKET SPREADS. FOR CERTAIN LOANS, THE FAIR VALUE IS MEASURED BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET OR LIABILITY IS THE RESULT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE AS COMPARED WITH CARRYING VALUE. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED FOR A FINANCIAL ASSET’S REMAINING LIFE IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT ARE ESTIMATED FOR A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS CALCULATION; FUTURE LOAN INCOME (INTEREST AND FEES) IS INCORPORATED IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT IS GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, SEE VALUATION HIERARCHY ON

PAGES 150–153.

NOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE OPTION

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION PROVIDES AN OPTION TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENT FOR SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS.

THE FIRM

HAS ELECTED TO MEASURE CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING TO MITIGATE INCOME STATEMENT VOLATILITY CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MEASUREMENT BASIS OF ELECTED INSTRUMENTS (E.G. CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS ELECTED WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS) AND THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS, AS WELL AS TO

BETTER REFLECT THOSE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

THE FIRM’S

ELECTION OF FAIR VALUE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS.

•

LOANS PURCHASED OR ORIGINATED AS PART OF SECURITIZATION WAREHOUSING ACTIVITY, SUBJECT TO BIFURCATION ACCOUNTING, OR MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS

•

CERTAIN

SECURITIES FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE AND/OR A MATURITY OF GREATER THAN ONE YEAR

•

OWNED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ELECTION WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.

•

LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN VALUE ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION OF THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY INFORMATION, WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.

•

LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN

THE FIRM’S

CREDIT SPREAD.

•

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

HOWEVER, INVESTORS ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE FIRM AS ISSUER FOR BOTH NONPRINCIPAL-PROTECTED AND PRINCIPAL PROTECTED NOTES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 5 – CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT

THE FIRM’S

RISK APPETITE.

IN

THE FIRM’S

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A KEY FOCUS ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS.

THE FIRM’S

WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS MANAGED THROUGH LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LOANS, SEE NOTE

14.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY PARTICULAR LOAN PRODUCT (E.G., OPTION

ARMS),

OR INDUSTRY SEGMENT (E.G., COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE), OR ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS, RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.

TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN

THE FIRM’S

ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM UNDERLYING ASSET PRICES, INDICES, REFERENCE RATES, OTHER INPUTS OR A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS AND MAY EXPOSE COUNTERPARTIES TO RISKS AND REWARDS OF AN UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO INITIALLY INVEST IN, OWN OR EXCHANGE THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE

MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CLIENTS AND ALSO USES DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE ITS OWN RISK EXPOSURES. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF

THE FIRM’S

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING OR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

MARKET-MAKING DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF

THE FIRM’S

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES. CLIENTS USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR MODIFY INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISKS.

THE FIRM

ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS FROM ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO OTHER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS OR BY PURCHASING OR SELLING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET THE EXPOSURE FROM CLIENT DERIVATIVES.

RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM

MANAGES CERTAIN MARKET AND CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES IN HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED TO MANAGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. SIMILARLY, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASES OR DECREASES AS A RESULT OF VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESETTING TO CURRENT MARKET RATES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE REPAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENT ORIGINATION OR ISSUANCE OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT CURRENT MARKET RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS.

THE FIRM

GENERALLY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED (I.E., NON-U.S. DOLLAR) ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS

THE FIRM’S

NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE U.S. DOLLAR–EQUIVALENT VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR THE FORECASTED REVENUES OR EXPENSES INCREASE OR DECREASE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

COMMODITIES CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION OF THE RELATED INVENTORY.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO MANAGE THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN THE ENTITY REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO PAY AN OBLIGATION WHEN DUE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CDS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES SECTION ON

PAGES 184–186

OF THIS NOTE.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES GAINS AND LOSSES TABLE ON

PAGE 184

OF THIS NOTE, AND THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING GAINS AND LOSSES TABLES ON

PAGES 182–184

OF THIS NOTE.

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND SETTLEMENT TYPES

THE FIRM

ENTERS INTO OTC DERIVATIVES

,

WHICH ARE NEGOTIATED AND SETTLED BILATERALLY WITH THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY.

THE FIRM

ALSO ENTERS INTO, AS PRINCIPAL, CERTAIN

ETD

SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AND

OTC-CLEARED

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH

CCPS.

ETD CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY STANDARDIZED CONTRACTS TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE AND CLEARED BY THE CCP, WHICH IS

THE FIRM’S

COUNTERPARTY FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES ARE TRADED ON A BILATERAL BASIS AND THEN NOVATED TO THE CCP FOR CLEARING.

DERIVATIVE CLEARING SERVICES

THE FIRM

PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES FOR CLIENTS WHERE

THE FIRM

ACTS AS A CLEARING MEMBER WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT REFLECT THE CLIENTS’ DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON

THE FIRM’S

CLEARING SERVICES, SEE NOTE

29.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES THAT

THE FIRM

EXECUTES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE.

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP

, THE FIRM

NETS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN

THE FIRM

AND THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 1. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE REPORTED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. THE TABULAR DISCLOSURES ON

PAGES 178–184

OF THIS NOTE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF, AND REPORTING FOR, DERIVATIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN STRUCTURED NOTES, SEE NOTES

3 AND 4.

174

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE FIRM

APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES – GENERALLY INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. HOWEVER,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN

THE FIRM’S

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO PURCHASED CDS USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES. FOR THE SAME REASON,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ADDITION, FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY MUST BE DOCUMENTED. HEDGE DOCUMENTATION MUST IDENTIFY THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY OR FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND TYPE OF RISK TO BE HEDGED, AND HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DERIVATIVE IS ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS,

THE FIRM

USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR-VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A DERIVATIVE HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST QUARTERLY. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EXACTLY OFFSET THE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK) MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATIONS: FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, AFS SECURITIES AND CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE, AND IN THE VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE HEDGED ITEM, AND FOR BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE HEDGES, IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES CASH FLOW HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN FORECASTED CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OCI AND RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, NONINTEREST REVENUE AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN

AOCI

IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED AFFECT EARNINGS. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL HEDGE FORECAST, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE VALUES RECORDED IN AOCI ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES NET INVESTMENT HEDGES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF

THE FIRM’S

NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN AOCI.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS INTRODUCED BY EACH DERIVATIVE CONTRACT TYPE, DERIVATIVES EXPOSE

JPMORGAN CHASE

TO CREDIT RISK — THE RISK THAT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND THE COLLATERAL, IF ANY, HELD BY

THE FIRM

PROVES TO BE OF INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO COVER THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION. IT IS THE POLICY OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

TO ACTIVELY PURSUE, WHERE POSSIBLE, THE USE OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY

THE FIRM.

WHILE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES EXPOSE

THE FIRM

TO CREDIT RISK, DERIVATIVE PAYABLES EXPOSE

THE FIRM

TO LIQUIDITY RISK, AS THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE

THE FIRM

TO POST CASH OR SECURITIES COLLATERAL WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE CONTRACTS MOVES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES’ FAVOR OR UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN

THE FIRM’S AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES’ RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF EITHER

THE FIRM

OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE PAYABLES RELATED TO OTC AND OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVES THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED UPON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE, AND THE ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL

A DOWNGRADE BY A SINGLE RATING AGENCY THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN A RATING LOWER THAN A PREEXISTING CORRESPONDING RATING PROVIDED BY ANOTHER MAJOR RATING AGENCY WILL GENERALLY NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL (EXCEPT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES IN WHICH ADDITIONAL INITIAL MARGIN MAY BE REQUIRED UPON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE), NOR IN TERMINATION PAYMENTS REQUIREMENTS. THE LIQUIDITY IMPACT IN THE TABLE IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A DOWNGRADE BELOW THE LOWEST CURRENT RATING OF THE RATING AGENCIES REFERRED TO IN THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT.

THE FIRM

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED INTEREST PAYMENT CASH FLOWS WOULD NOT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THE PLANNED REDUCTION IN WHOLESALE NON-OPERATING DEPOSITS.

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS,

THE FIRM

EXPECTS THAT

APPROXIMATELY

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. SEE NOTE

FOR INFORMATION ON PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD-PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS THE PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY, A FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION OR A RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION BUT HAS THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT EVENT.

THE FIRM

IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND USES THESE DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES. FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER,

THE FIRM

ACTIVELY MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. SECOND, AS AN END-USER,

THE FIRM

USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES IN

THE FIRM’S

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, AND TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN

THE FIRM’S

MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.

184

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (“SINGLE-NAME”) OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX.

THE FIRM

PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION ON BOTH SINGLE- NAME AND INDEX-REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS. SINGLE-NAME CDS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE EITHER OTC OR OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY, WHILE INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND OTHER MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX CONSISTS OF A PORTFOLIO OF CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE ENTITIES. NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE PERIODICALLY ESTABLISHED WITH A NEW UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX. CDS CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCE NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST

$1 MILLION

OF REALIZED CREDIT LOSSES IN A

$10 MILLION

PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE ENTITY. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE VALUE OF THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT SETTLEMENT OF THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER DOES NOT NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTES

A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE IS A FUNDED CREDIT DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE PURCHASES FROM THE NOTE INVESTOR CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCE ENTITY OR AN INDEX. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR PAYS THE ISSUER THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN RETURN, THE ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR, BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE REFERENCED ENTITY. THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS THE REFERENCE ENTITY (OR ONE OF THE ENTITIES THAT MAKES UP A REFERENCE INDEX) EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT. IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS THE INVESTOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY TO THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE HAS RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE ENTITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CREDIT-RELATED NOTES

THE FIRM

SOLD AND PURCHASED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015.

UPON A CREDIT EVENT,

THE FIRM

AS A SELLER OF PROTECTION WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE FULL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF NET PROTECTION SOLD, AS THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE CONTRACTS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT.

THE FIRM

MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES. OTHER PURCHASED PROTECTION REFERENCED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, REFERENCE POSITIONS (INCLUDING INDICES, PORTFOLIO COVERAGE AND OTHER REFERENCE POINTS) AS WELL AS PROTECTION PURCHASED THROUGH CREDIT-RELATED NOTES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM

DOES NOT USE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR SUCH DERIVATIVES, BECAUSE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, OR RELATED CASH INSTRUMENTS AND ECONOMIC HEDGES, EACH OF WHICH REDUCES, IN

THE FIRM’S

VIEW, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVES.

NOTE 9 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OPEB PLANS THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (GENERALLY BASE SALARY/REGULAR PAY AND VARIABLE CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CAPPED AT $100,000 ANNUALLY). EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING

ONE YEAR

OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER

THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRM’S POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. THE FIRM DOES NOT ANTICIPATE AT THIS TIME ANY CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IN

2017

. THE

2017

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$44 MILLION

OF WHICH

$28 MILLION

ARE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EARNED PAY CREDITS ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN; NO FURTHER PAY CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED UNDER THIS PLAN. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (“PBO”) IN THE AMOUNT OF

$215 MILLION

AND

$237 MILLION

, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY PROVIDES TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE “401(K) SAVINGS PLAN”), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ON A PRETAX AND/OR ROTH 401(K) AFTER-TAX BASIS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN.

THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO

5%

OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (GENERALLY BASE SALARY/REGULAR PAY AND VARIABLE CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

189

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AFTER COMPLETING A

ONE

-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF

$250,000

OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST AFTER

THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH THE LENGTH OF SERVICE AND THE DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRM’S SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTORY. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, THERE WAS

A TRANSITION OF CERTAIN MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREES FROM JPMORGAN CHASE GROUP SPONSORED COVERAGE TO MEDICARE EXCHANGES. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, ELIGIBLE RETIREES WILL RECEIVE A HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT AMOUNT EACH YEAR IF THEY ENROLL THROUGH THE MEDICARE EXCHANGE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE WAS NOT MATERIAL. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (“COLI”) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CHANGES IN BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, PLAN ASSETS AND FUNDED STATUS AMOUNTS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR THE FIRM’S U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

GAINS AND LOSSES

FOR THE FIRM’S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE PBO OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY

SEVEN YEARS

AND FOR THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IS THE PERIOD APPROPRIATE FOR THE AFFECTED PLAN. IN ADDITION, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLAN WHEN THE PRIOR SERVICE COST IS FIRST RECOGNIZED. THE AVERAGE REMAINING AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR CURRENT PRIOR SERVICE COSTS IS

THREE YEARS.

FOR THE FIRM’S OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A

FIVE

-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. THIS VALUE IS REFERRED TO AS THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES, ADJUSTED FOR GAINS AND LOSSES NOT YET RECOGNIZED, IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. ANY EXCESS NET GAIN OR LOSS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFETIME OF RETIRED PARTICIPANTS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

TWELVE YEARS

; HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS RESULTING FROM PLAN CHANGES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

TWO YEARS.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR’S PROJECTED LONG-TERM

(

10

OR MORE YEARS) RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO MIX OF EACH PLAN.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. THE RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON “AA” RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS IS BASED ON AN IMPLIED YIELD FOR SIMILAR BONDS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS WAS PROVIDED BY THE FIRM’S ACTUARIES. THIS RATE WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLAN’S PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT THE

ONE

-YEAR FORWARD RATES

IMPLIED BY THE MERCER YIELD CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN REPRESENTS A RATE OF APPROPRIATE DURATION FROM THE ANALYSIS OF YIELD CURVES PROVIDED BY THE FIRM’S ACTUARIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM DECREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH WILL INCREASE EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN ASSETS ARE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (E.G., HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS). NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE ALSO INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRM’S COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE ALLOCATED TO INVESTMENTS INTENDED TO REPLICATE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDICES.

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS AND GOALS OF THE PLAN USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER. ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. PERIODICALLY THE FIRM PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS, INCORPORATING PROJECTED ASSET AND LIABILITY DATA, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION ON CUMULATIVE PENSION EXPENSE, ECONOMIC COST, PRESENT VALUE OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDED STATUS.

CURRENTLY, APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE: U.S. EQUITY

AND PRIVATE EQUITY

0%

TO

. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT MANAGED TO A SPECIFIC TARGET BUT SEEK TO SHIFT ASSET CLASS ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THESE STATED RANGES. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES INCORPORATE THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPLICATIONS OF THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES WHILE MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PLAN. THE FIRM

REGULARLY REVIEWS THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ASSET MANAGERS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITIES. TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY IN RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY PROFILES, THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS’ LARGEST ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE TO DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROPRIATE DURATIONS. OTHER ASSETS, MAINLY EQUITY SECURITIES, ARE THEN INVESTED FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT GROWTH. SIMILAR TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ASSET MANAGERS FOR THE U.K. PLANS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND THE PORTFOLIOS ARE REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH AS MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND COUNTRY RISKS. EXPOSURE TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY THE BROAD DIVERSIFICATION OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INVESTMENTS IN EACH OF THE COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE FURTHER DIVERSIFIED INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM’S U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT THROUGH INDIRECT EXPOSURES THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS. THE PLANS HOLD INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE SPONSORED OR MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

$3.4 BILLION

AND

$3.2 BILLION

FOR U.S. PLANS AND

$1.2 BILLION

AND

ALL RSU AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL VESTED AND CONTAIN CLAWBACK PROVISIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN CANCELLATION UNDER CERTAIN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. RSUS ENTITLE THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSUS ARE OUTSTANDING AND, AS SUCH, ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24.

IN JANUARY 2016,

THE FIRM’S

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE GRANT OF PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (“PSUS”) TO MEMBERS OF

THE FIRM’S

OPERATING COMMITTEE UNDER THE VARIABLE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR PERFORMANCE YEAR 2015. PSUS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE FIRM’S

ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CRITERIA OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT VEST CAN RANGE FROM ZERO TO 150% OF THE GRANT AMOUNT. THE AWARDS VEST AND ARE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE QUARTER AFTER THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IN ADDITION, DIVIDENDS ARE NOTIONALLY REINVESTED IN

THE FIRM’S

COMMON STOCK AND WILL BE DELIVERED ONLY IN RESPECT OF ANY EARNED SHARES.

ONCE THE PSUS HAVE VESTED, THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT ARE DELIVERED, AFTER APPLICABLE TAX WITHHOLDING, MUST BE HELD FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO-YEAR PERIOD, FOR A TOTAL COMBINED VESTING AND HOLDING PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (“SARS”) HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM

PERIODICALLY GRANTS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES.

THERE WERE NO MATERIAL GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS OR SARS

IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014. SARS GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM

SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, AS IF IT WERE A SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. GENERALLY, FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR AWARDS WITH FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS AND AWARDS GRANTED WITH NO FUTURE SUBSTANTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENT,

THE FIRM

ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES AS OF THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEE’S FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRM’S POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. DURING

2016

,

2015

AND

2014

, THE FIRM SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN JANUARY 2008,

THE FIRM

AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO

2 MILLION

SARS. THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY AWARDED BY

THE FIRM.

ON JULY 15, 2014, THE COMPENSATION & MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DETERMINED THAT ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE VESTING OF THE

2 MILLION

SAR AWARDS HAD BEEN MET AND THUS, THE AWARDS BECAME EXERCISABLE.

THE SARS, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2018, HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$39.83

(THE PRICE OF JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT). THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS AWARD WAS DEPENDENT ON CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SARS THROUGH JULY 15, 2014 (THE DATE WHEN THE VESTED NUMBER OF SARS WERE DETERMINED), AND THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH WAS INITIALLY ASSUMED TO BE

FIVE YEARS

BUT, EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, WAS EXTENDED TO

SIX AND ONE-HALF YEARS

. THE FIRM

RECOGNIZED

$3 MILLION

IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2014 FOR THIS AWARD.

PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF

THE FIRM’S

AFS AND HTM INVESTMENT SECURITIES (THE “INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO”) ARE HELD BY TREASURY AND CIO IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016,

THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF

AA+

(BASED UPON EXTERNAL RATINGS WHERE AVAILABLE, AND WHERE NOT AVAILABLE, BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL RATINGS WHICH CORRESPOND TO RATINGS AS DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S). AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO AOCI. THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. HTM DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD UNTIL MATURITY, ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR BOTH AFS AND HTM DEBT SECURITIES, PURCHASE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE SECURITY.

DURING 2016, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED COMMERCIAL MBS AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$7.5 BILLION

FROM AFS TO HTM. THESE SECURITIES WERE TRANSFERRED AT FAIR VALUE. AOCI INCLUDED NET PRETAX UNREALIZED GAINS OF

$78 MILLION

ON THE SECURITIES AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER. THE TRANSFERS REFLECT THE FIRM’S INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES TO MATURITY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF PRICE VOLATILITY ON AOCI. THIS TRANSFER WAS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES

THE FIRM

HAS RECOGNIZED UNREALIZED LOSSES ON SECURITIES IT INTENDS TO SELL AS OTTI.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL ANY OF THE REMAINING  SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED LOSS IN AOCI AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT

THE FIRM

WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY OF THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS. EXCEPT FOR THE SECURITIES FOR WHICH CREDIT LOSSES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME,

THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT THE SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED LOSS IN AOCI ARE NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

AFS DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND HTM DEBT SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF

THE FIRM’S

ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF OTTI.

FOR MOST TYPES OF DEBT SECURITIES,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN

THE FIRM

DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. FOR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS THAT ARE RATED BELOW “AA” AT THEIR ACQUISITION, OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT

THE FIRM

WOULD NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED INVESTMENT,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS AN IMPAIRMENT TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN THERE IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. FOR AFS EQUITY SECURITIES,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT

THE FIRM

WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST BASIS.

POTENTIAL OTTI IS CONSIDERED USING A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; ADVERSE CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A SECURITY; PAYMENT STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY; CHANGES TO THE RATING OF THE SECURITY BY A RATING AGENCY; THE VOLATILITY OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES; AND

THE FIRM’S

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY UNTIL RECOVERY.

FOR AFS DEBT SECURITIES,

THE FIRM

RECOGNIZES OTTI LOSSES IN EARNINGS IF

THE FIRM

HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY, OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

THE FIRM

WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES. FOR DEBT SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION THAT

THE FIRM

HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE SECURITIES ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IN THE EVENT OF A CREDIT LOSS, ONLY THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. AMOUNTS RELATING TO FACTORS OTHER THAN CREDIT LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN OCI.

THE FIRM’S

CASH FLOW EVALUATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND EXPECTATIONS OF RELEVANT MARKET AND ECONOMIC DATA AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. FOR SECURITIES ISSUED IN A SECURITIZATION,

THE FIRM

ESTIMATES CASH FLOWS CONSIDERING UNDERLYING LOAN-LEVEL DATA AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE SECURITIZATION, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, EXCESS SPREAD, OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, AND COMPARES THE LOSSES PROJECTED FOR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (“POOL LOSSES”) AGAINST THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE POOL LOSSES, OR WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS.

THE FIRM

ALSO PERFORMS OTHER ANALYSES TO SUPPORT ITS CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, SUCH AS FIRST-LOSS ANALYSES OR STRESS SCENARIOS.

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OTTI LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IF

THE FIRM

INTENDS TO SELL THE SECURITY. IN OTHER CASES

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS THE RELEVANT FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS

THE FIRM’S

INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE, AND WHETHER EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT A REALIZABLE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE COST BASIS. ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON AN EQUITY SECURITY IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY.

NOTE 13 – SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE

ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, “SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS”) PRIMARILY TO FINANCE

THE FIRM’S

INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS, ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS’ FINANCING NEEDS,

AND

SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THE SECURITIES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED. SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. WHERE APPROPRIATE UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SEE

NOTE 1. FEES RECEIVED AND PAID IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE FIRM

HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, SEE NOTE

4.

THE SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, FOR AGREEMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE

THE FIRM

TO CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. TO MANAGE THESE RISKS,

THE FIRM

MONITORS THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES (PREDOMINANTLY HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES COLLATERAL, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT AND AGENCY MBS) THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM OR PROVIDED TO ITS COUNTERPARTIES COMPARED TO THE VALUE OF CASH PROCEEDS AND EXCHANGED COLLATERAL, AND EITHER REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR RETURNS SECURITIES OR COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. MARGIN LEVELS ARE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE COUNTERPARTY, THE TYPE OF UNDERLYING SECURITIES, AND THE PERMISSIBLE COLLATERAL, AND ARE MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

IN RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS,

THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES RECEIVED IS LESS THAN INITIAL CASH PRINCIPAL ADVANCED AND ANY COLLATERAL AMOUNTS EXCHANGED. IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS, CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE ARISES TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALUE OF UNDERLYING SECURITIES EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE INITIAL CASH PRINCIPAL ADVANCED, AND ANY COLLATERAL AMOUNTS EXCHANGED.

ADDITIONALLY,

THE FIRM

TYPICALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES AND ANY COLLATERAL AMOUNTS EXCHANGED IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT.

IT IS ALSO

THE FIRM’S

POLICY TO TAKE POSSESSION, WHERE POSSIBLE, OF THE SECURITIES UNDERLYING RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ASSETS PLEDGED AND COLLATERAL RECEIVED IN SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE 30.

AS A RESULT OF

THE FIRM’S

CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO RESALE AND SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

THE FIRM

DID NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT IMPAIRMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE GROSS AND NET AMOUNTS OF

THE FIRM’S

SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND 2015. WHEN

THE FIRM

HAS OBTAINED AN APPROPRIATE LEGAL OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT WITH A COUNTERPARTY AND WHERE OTHER RELEVANT NETTING CRITERIA UNDER U.S. GAAP ARE MET,

THE FIRM

NETS, ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, THE BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM

EXCHANGES SECURITIES AND/OR CASH COLLATERAL WITH ITS COUNTERPARTIES; THIS COLLATERAL ALSO REDUCES, IN

THE FIRM’S

VIEW, THE ECONOMIC EXPOSURE WITH

THE COUNTERPARTY. SUCH COLLATERAL, ALONG WITH SECURITIES FINANCING BALANCES THAT DO NOT MEET ALL THESE RELEVANT NETTING CRITERIA UNDER U.S. GAAP, IS PRESENTED AS “AMOUNTS NOT NETTABLE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS,” AND REDUCES THE “NET AMOUNTS” PRESENTED BELOW, IF

THE FIRM

HAS AN APPROPRIATE LEGAL OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTERPARTY. WHERE A LEGAL OPINION HAS NOT BEEN EITHER SOUGHT OR OBTAINED, THE SECURITIES FINANCING BALANCES ARE PRESENTED GROSS IN THE “NET AMOUNTS” BELOW, AND RELATED COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 – LOANS

LOAN ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENT’S STRATEGY FOR THE LOAN, AND ON WHETHER THE LOAN WAS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

THE FIRM

ACCOUNTS FOR LOANS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

•

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (I.E., “RETAINED”), OTHER THAN PCI LOANS

•

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

•

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

•

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES A DETAILED ACCOUNTING DISCUSSION OF THESE LOAN CATEGORIES.

LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PCI LOANS)

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, ARE RECORDED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE FOLLOWING: CHARGE-OFFS; INTEREST APPLIED TO PRINCIPAL (FOR LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD); UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS; AND NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS. CREDIT CARD LOANS ALSO INCLUDE BILLED FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

INTEREST INCOME

INTEREST INCOME ON PERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST. PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS, AS WELL AS NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE LOAN TO PRODUCE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CONSIDERED NONPERFORMING WHEN FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS NOT EXPECTED, REGARDLESS OF DELINQUENCY STATUS, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST HAS BEEN IN DEFAULT FOR A PERIOD OF

90 DAYS

OR MORE, UNLESS THE LOAN IS BOTH WELL-SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION. A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE PAST DUE WHEN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER BY THE CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED DUE DATE OR FOR CERTAIN LOANS (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS), WHEN A MONTHLY PAYMENT IS DUE AND UNPAID FOR

30 DAYS

OR MORE. FINALLY, COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE TYPICALLY MAINTAINED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS.

ON THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALL INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED (I.E., ON A CASH BASIS) IF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE IS DEEMED FULLY COLLECTIBLE; HOWEVER, IF THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE, ALL INTEREST CASH RECEIPTS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOAN (THE COST RECOVERY METHOD). FOR CONSUMER LOANS, APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY TYPICALLY RESULTS IN

THE FIRM

RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS ON A CASH BASIS.

A LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THERE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN.

AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS; ACCORDINGLY, INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. HOWEVER,

THE FIRM

SEPARATELY ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS OFFSET AGAINST LOANS AND CHARGED TO INTEREST INCOME, FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF ACCRUED AND BILLED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME ON CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WITH A CHARGE TO INTEREST INCOME AND IS REPORTED AS AN OFFSET TO LOANS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT LOAN PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND IS RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A CONTRA ASSET, WHICH BRINGS THE RECORDED INVESTMENT TO THE NET CARRYING VALUE. CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SEE NOTE

15

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON

THE FIRM’S

ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING, RISK-RATED AUTO AND PCI LOANS, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF OR CHARGED DOWN TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (I.E., FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL), WITH AN OFFSET TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE

FFIEC.

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, NON-MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF NO LATER THAN

180 DAYS

PAST DUE.

AUTO, STUDENT AND MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF NO LATER THAN

120 DAYS

PAST DUE.

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS WILL BE CHARGED OFF EARLIER THAN THE FFIEC CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOLLOWS.

•

A CHARGE-OFF IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A LOAN IS MODIFIED IN A

TDR

IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT.

•

LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED AN EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY) THAT SUGGESTS A LOSS IS EITHER KNOWN OR HIGHLY CERTAIN ARE SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

60 DAYS

PAST DUE, OR SOONER IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. CREDIT CARD, STUDENT AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WITHIN

60 DAYS

OF

208

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OR OTHER EVENT.

•

AUTO LOANS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE UPON REPOSSESSION OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND AFTER A REDEMPTION PERIOD (I.E., THE PERIOD DURING WHICH A BORROWER MAY CURE THE LOAN) HAS PASSED.

OTHER THAN IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE FIRM

TYPICALLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGE-OFFS ON GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS, RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND RISK-RATED AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE BOTH IMPAIRED AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE A CHARGE-OFF INCLUDES MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF

THE FIRM’S

CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN AND VALUATION OF THE BORROWER’S EQUITY OR THE LOAN COLLATERAL.

WHEN A LOAN IS CHARGED DOWN TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL (E.G., SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE). IN CASES WHERE THE COLLATERAL IS IN THE FORM OF LIQUID SECURITIES, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR BROKER QUOTES. FOR ILLIQUID SECURITIES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL.

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. WHEN IT BECOMES LIKELY THAT A BORROWER IS EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY,

THE FIRM

OBTAINS A BROKER’S PRICE OPINION OF THE HOME BASED ON AN EXTERIOR-ONLY VALUATION (“EXTERIOR OPINIONS”), WHICH IS THEN UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY

SIX MONTHS

THEREAFTER. AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER

THE FIRM

RECEIVES THE PROPERTY IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION), GENERALLY, EITHER THROUGH FORECLOSURE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER,

THE FIRM

OBTAINS AN APPRAISAL BASED ON AN INSPECTION THAT INCLUDES THE INTERIOR OF THE HOME (“INTERIOR APPRAISALS”). EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS ARE DISCOUNTED BASED UPON

THE FIRM’S

EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES AS COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATED VALUES PROVIDED BY EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS, CONSIDERING STATE- AND PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON APPRAISALS FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. COLLATERAL VALUES ARE TYPICALLY UPDATED EVERY

SIX

TO

TWELVE MONTHS

,

EITHER BY OBTAINING A NEW APPRAISAL OR BY PERFORMING AN INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE FIRM’S

POLICIES.

THE FIRM

ALSO CONSIDERS BOTH BORROWER- AND MARKET-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OBTAINING APPRAISAL UPDATES OR BROKER PRICE OPINIONS AT MORE FREQUENT INTERVALS.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. FOR CONSUMER LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON AN INDIVIDUAL LOAN BASIS.

INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST.

LOAN ORIGINATION FEES OR COSTS AND PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE DEFERRED IN A CONTRA LOAN ACCOUNT UNTIL THE RELATED LOAN IS SOLD. THE DEFERRED FEES AND DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASIS OF THE LOAN AND THEREFORE ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIODIC DETERMINATION OF THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND/OR THE GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NONACCRUAL POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BECAUSE HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE,

THE FIRM’S

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

LOANS USED IN A MARKET-MAKING STRATEGY OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED UPFRONT IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE CATEGORY AS INCURRED.

BECAUSE THESE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE,

THE FIRM’S

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON

THE FIRM’S

ELECTIONS OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. SEE NOTE

3

AND NOTE

4

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

PCI LOANS

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. PCI LOANS HAVE EVIDENCE OF CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE THE LOAN’S ORIGINATION DATE AND THEREFORE IT IS PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE COLLECTED. BECAUSE PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES, NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO PCI LOANS IS RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. SEE

PAGE 219

OF THIS NOTE FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING FOR PCI LOANS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOAN CLASSIFICATION CHANGES

LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; NON-CREDIT RELATED LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN THE EVENT THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN A LOAN IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO, THE LOAN IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON

THE FIRM’S

ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING

THE FIRM’S

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE

15.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

THE FIRM

SEEKS TO MODIFY CERTAIN LOANS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THE MODIFICATION,

JPMORGAN CHASE

GRANTS ONE OR MORE CONCESSIONS TO A BORROWER WHO IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE

THE FIRM’S

ECONOMIC LOSS, AVOID FORECLOSURE OR REPOSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL, AND TO ULTIMATELY MAXIMIZE PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY

THE FIRM

FROM THE BORROWER. THE CONCESSIONS GRANTED VARY BY PROGRAM AND BY BORROWER-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM EXTENSIONS, PAYMENT DEFERRALS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF EQUITY OR OTHER ASSETS IN LIEU OF PAYMENTS.

SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TDRS. A LOAN THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED UNTIL IT MATURES, IS REPAID, OR IS OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BORROWER PERFORMS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE MODIFIED LOAN IS AT OR ABOVE THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AT THE TIME OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ASSUMING THAT THE LOAN SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMS UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS AND

THE FIRM

EXPECTS TO COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS, THE LOAN IS DISCLOSED AS IMPAIRED AND AS A TDR ONLY DURING THE YEAR OF THE MODIFICATION; IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, THE LOAN IS NOT DISCLOSED AS AN IMPAIRED LOAN OR AS A TDR SO LONG AS REPAYMENT OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

LOANS, EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, MODIFIED IN A TDR ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES SUCH LOANS WERE ALREADY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. THESE LOANS MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS (THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS RESUMED) IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: (I) THE BORROWER HAS PERFORMED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS FOR A MINIMUM OF

SIX MONTHS

AND/OR

SIX

PAYMENTS, AND (II)

THE FIRM

HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE MODIFIED LOAN IS REASONABLY ASSURED BASED ON, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BORROWER’S DEBT CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF FUTURE EARNINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES, LTV RATIOS, AND OTHER CURRENT MARKET CONSIDERATIONS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED AND WELL-DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE LOAN IS CURRENT AT THE MODIFICATION DATE, SUCH LOANS ARE NOT PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AT THE TIME OF MODIFICATION.

BECAUSE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THESE LOANS ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING

THE FIRM’S

ESTABLISHED ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY, WHICH CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES FOR THE MODIFIED LOANS. A LOAN MODIFIED IN A TDR GENERALLY REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY THROUGHOUT ITS REMAINING LIFE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOAN IS PERFORMING AND HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS AND/OR THE LOAN HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE IMPAIRED LOANS DISCLOSURES (I.E., LOANS RESTRUCTURED AT MARKET RATES). FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE

THE FIRM’S

ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, SEE NOTE

15.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM

ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES. PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, LAND, AND BUILDINGS) AND COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (E.G., AUTOMOBILES, AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS).

THE FIRM

RECOGNIZES FORECLOSED PROPERTY UPON RECEIVING ASSETS IN SATISFACTION OF A LOAN (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION). FOR LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL PROPERTY,

THE FIRM

GENERALLY RECOGNIZES THE ASSET RECEIVED AT FORECLOSURE SALE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER. FORECLOSED ASSETS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INITIALLY RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO FAIR VALUE ARE CHARGED/CREDITED TO NONINTEREST REVENUE. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE.

DELINQUENCY RATES ARE A PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CONSUMER LOANS. LOANS THAT ARE MORE THAN

30 DAYS

PAST DUE PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING OF BORROWERS WHO MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND/OR WHO MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO REPAY THE LOAN. AS THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE, IT BECOMES MORE CLEAR THAT THE BORROWER IS LIKELY EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. IN THE CASE OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (GREATER THAN

150 DAYS

PAST DUE) ARE A STRONG INDICATOR OF LOANS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A FORECLOSURE OR SIMILAR LIQUIDATION TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS FOR CONSUMER LOANS VARY BASED ON THE CLASS OF LOAN, AS FOLLOWS.

•

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, INCLUDING BOTH NON-PCI AND PCI PORTFOLIOS, THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO, OR THE COMBINED LTV RATIO IN THE CASE OF JUNIOR LIEN LOANS, IS AN INDICATOR OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS SEVERITY IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, LTV OR COMBINED LTV RATIOS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO A BORROWER’S CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO PAY, AS THE DELINQUENCY RATE OF HIGH-LTV LOANS TENDS TO BE GREATER THAN THAT FOR LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF

THE LOAN COLLATERAL ALSO PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO, AS FACTORS SUCH AS THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, HOME PRICE CHANGES AND SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS, WILL AFFECT CREDIT QUALITY. THE BORROWER’S CURRENT OR “REFRESHED” FICO SCORE IS A SECONDARY CREDIT-QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CERTAIN LOANS, AS FICO SCORES ARE AN INDICATION OF THE BORROWER’S CREDIT PAYMENT HISTORY. THUS, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A LOW FICO SCORE

(

660

OR BELOW) IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF HIGHER RISK THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH FICO SCORE. FURTHER, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A LOW FICO SCORE IS AT GREATER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER THAT HAS BOTH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A HIGH FICO SCORE.

•

FOR SCORED AUTO, SCORED BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION IS AN INDICATOR OF THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SIMILAR TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE BASED ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EVENTS.

•

RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS ARE SIMILAR TO WHOLESALE LOANS IN THAT THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS ARE THE RISK RATING THAT IS ASSIGNED TO THE LOAN AND WHETHER THE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICIZED AND/OR NONACCRUAL. RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT BORROWERS’ ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT RISK-RATED WHOLESALE LOAN CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE

PAGES 224–225

OF THIS NOTE.

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE — EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION BY CLASS FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE — EXCLUDING RETAINED PCI LOANS IN THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ANALYZING CERTAIN CREDIT STATISTICS APPLICABLE TO

THE FIRM’S

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE — EXCLUDING PCI LOANS PORTFOLIO: (I) JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS MAY BE FULLY CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

180 DAYS

PAST DUE, AND THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN, RESULTING IN RELATIVELY HIGH CHARGE-OFF RATES FOR THIS PRODUCT CLASS; AND (II) THE LENGTHENING OF LOSS-MITIGATION TIMELINES MAY RESULT IN HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES FOR LOANS CARRIED AT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THAT REMAIN ON

(B) THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY OR WHEN THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOAN AMOUNT.

HELOCS

BEYOND THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND

HELOANS

HAVE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES THAN HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THAT IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT THAT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED FOR THOSE PRODUCTS IS HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT OPTIONS

AVAILABLE FOR HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES ASSOCIATED WITH AMORTIZING HELOCS AND HELOANS ARE FACTORED INTO

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT ACQUISITION. PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER MAY BE AGGREGATED INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ALL OF THE CONSUMER PCI LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS,

THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST) EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF EACH POOL. THESE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT REFLECT THEN-CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (I.E., INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES) TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL LOSS PLUS ANY RELATED FORGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT THE POOL’S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (E.G., DECREASED CREDIT LOSSES, THE NET BENEFIT OF MODIFICATIONS) WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WITH ANY REMAINING INCREASES RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS. THE IMPACTS OF (I) PREPAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE INTEREST RATES, AND (III) ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO MODIFY CERTAIN PCI LOANS. THE IMPACT OF THESE MODIFICATIONS IS INCORPORATED INTO

THE FIRM’S

QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS HAS OCCURRED, AND THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS PCI LOANS. IN EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF MODIFICATIONS ON EXPECTED CASH FLOWS,

THE FIRM

INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF ANY FORGONE INTEREST AND ALSO CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT.

THE FIRM

DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE USED TO COMPUTE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA.

THE FIRM

ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO-DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED MODIFIED PCI LOANS.

THE EXCESS OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IS REFERRED TO AS THE ACCRETABLE YIELD. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT REPORTED ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BUT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF LOANS.

IF THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON PCI LOAN POOLS WERE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO INTEREST WOULD BE ACCRETED AND THE LOAN POOLS WOULD BE REPORTED AS NONACCRUAL LOANS; HOWEVER, SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR

THE FIRM’S

PCI CONSUMER LOAN POOLS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, INTEREST IS BEING ACCRETED AND THE LOAN POOLS ARE BEING REPORTED AS PERFORMING LOANS.

THE LIQUIDATION OF PCI LOANS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF LOANS, RECEIPT OF PAYMENT IN FULL FROM THE BORROWER, OR FORECLOSURE, RESULTS IN REMOVAL OF THE LOANS FROM THE UNDERLYING PCI POOL. WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS (E.G., CASH, REAL ESTATE), IF ANY, IS LESS THAN THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN, THE DIFFERENCE IS FIRST APPLIED AGAINST THE PCI POOL’S NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR PRINCIPAL LOSSES (I.E., THE LIFETIME CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATE ESTABLISHED AS A PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT AT THE ACQUISITION DATE). WHEN THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE FOR A PARTICULAR LOAN POOL HAS BEEN FULLY DEPLETED, ANY EXCESS OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN OVER THE LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS IS WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE PCI POOL’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. BEGINNING IN 2014, WRITE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS ALSO INCLUDE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST FORGIVENESS MODIFICATIONS. BECAUSE

THE FIRM’S

PCI LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT A POOL LEVEL,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS WHEN THEY REACH SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY (I.E., UNLIKE NON-PCI CONSUMER LOANS, THESE LOANS ARE NOT CHARGED OFF BASED ON FFIEC STANDARDS).

THE PCI PORTFOLIO AFFECTS

THE FIRM’S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH: (I) CONTRIBUTION TO NET INTEREST MARGIN; (II) EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFAULTS AND SERVICING RESULTING FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF THE LOANS; AND (III) ANY PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE FUNDED BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOANS. FOR EXAMPLE, VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH VARIABLE-RATE LIABILITIES AND FIXED-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH FIXED-RATE LIABILITIES WITH A SIMILAR MATURITY PROFILE. A NET SPREAD WILL BE EARNED ON THE DECLINING BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

TO HAVE A REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF

8 YEARS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SEGMENT INCLUDES CREDIT CARD LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED BY

THE FIRM.

DELINQUENCY RATES ARE THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS AS THEY PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING THAT BORROWERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES

(

30 DAYS

PAST DUE); INFORMATION ON THOSE BORROWERS THAT HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME

(

90 DAYS

PAST DUE) IS ALSO CONSIDERED. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOANS PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY.

WHILE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE IS ANOTHER GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT VIEW CREDIT SCORES AS A PRIMARY INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY BECAUSE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE TENDS TO BE A LAGGING INDICATOR. HOWEVER, THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SCORES PROVIDES A GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. REFRESHED FICO SCORE INFORMATION, WHICH IS OBTAINED AT LEAST QUARTERLY, FOR A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO IS INDICATED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE; FICO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE INDUSTRY BENCHMARK FOR CREDIT SCORES.

THE FIRM

GENERALLY ORIGINATES NEW CARD ACCOUNTS TO PRIME CONSUMER BORROWERS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CARDHOLDERS’ FICO SCORES MAY DECREASE OVER TIME, DEPENDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CARDHOLDER AND CHANGES IN CREDIT SCORE TECHNOLOGY.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE

MAY OFFER ONE OF A NUMBER OF LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO CREDIT CARD BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. MOST OF THE CREDIT CARD LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MODIFICATIONS UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS INVOLVE PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN, GENERALLY FOR

60 MONTHS

. THE FIRM

MAY ALSO OFFER SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO MAY BE IN NEED OF TEMPORARY RELIEF; HOWEVER, NONE ARE CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED. MODIFICATIONS UNDER ALL SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS TYPICALLY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT CARD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE TDRS.

IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. ASSUMING THAT THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT BEGIN TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PAYMENT TERMS, THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE AND WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE FIRM’S

STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. IN ADDITION, IF A BORROWER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THEN THE LOAN REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT REINSTATE THE BORROWER’S LINE OF CREDIT.

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO

WHOLESALE LOANS INCLUDE LOANS MADE TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR WHOLESALE LOANS IS THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED TO EACH LOAN. RISK RATINGS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS AND DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. RISK RATINGS ON LOANS CONSIDER THE

PD AND THE LGD.

THE PD IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL DEFAULT. THE LGD IS THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON THE LOAN THAT WOULD BE REALIZED UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE BORROWER AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE RISK RATING, INCLUDING THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES.

THE FIRM’S

DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED ALIGNS WITH THE BANKING REGULATORY DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURES, WHICH CONSIST OF SPECIAL MENTION, SUBSTANDARD AND DOUBTFUL CATEGORIES. RISK RATINGS GENERALLY REPRESENT RATINGS PROFILES SIMILAR TO THOSE DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S. INVESTMENT-GRADE RATINGS RANGE FROM “AAA/AAA” TO “BBB-/BAA3.” NONINVESTMENT-GRADE RATINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS NONCRITICIZED (“BB+/BA1 AND B-/B3”) AND CRITICIZED (“CCC+”/“CAA1 AND BELOW”), AND THE CRITICIZED PORTION IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO PERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS, REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CRITICIZED LOANS HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN NONCRITICIZED LOANS.

RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE RISK RATING OF A LOAN CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THE OVERALL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK,

THE FIRM

FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND CLIENT EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERN. SEE NOTE

5

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 15 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE CONSUMER, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS (PRIMARILY SCORED) AND WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) PORTFOLIO, AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN

THE FIRM’S

RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTIMATES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING METHODOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE ON THE UNDERLYING LOANS. DURING

2016

, THE FIRM

DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES USED TO DETERMINE ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES; SUCH POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CRO, THE

CFO

AND THE CONTROLLER OF

THE FIRM

AND DISCUSSED WITH THE DRPC AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO).

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION TO PROVIDE FOR INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN ALL CONSUMER LOANS AND PERFORMING RISK-RATED LOANS, EXCEPT FOR ANY LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TDRS AND PCI LOANS, WHICH ARE CALCULATED AS A PART OF THE ASSET-SPECIFIC AND PCI COMPONENTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS NOTE. SEE NOTE

14

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON TDRS AND PCI LOANS.

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT - CONSUMER LOANS AND CERTAIN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL CREDIT LOSS FACTORS (ESTIMATED PD AND LOSS SEVERITIES) TO THE RECORDED INVESTMENT BALANCES OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF POOLS OF LOAN EXPOSURES WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS OVER A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES. ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS MAY VARY BY PRODUCT AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME; MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS, USING AVAILABLE CREDIT INFORMATION AND TRENDS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORY, USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT USES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS ACTUAL PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ACTUAL

LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON DEFAULTED LOANS AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS, TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATE. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TYPE AND RESULTS OF SUCH MODIFICATIONS.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THEN ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT THAT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION; THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, BORROWER BEHAVIOR, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PAYMENT RECASTS WITHIN THE HELOC PORTFOLIO, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE FACTORS CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PERFORMANCE OF A HELOC THAT EXPERIENCES A PAYMENT RECAST MAY BE AFFECTED BY BOTH THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS APPLIED IN ORIGINATING THE LOAN AND THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE PAYMENT RECAST. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS INTO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND EMPHASIZING ONE INPUT OR ASSUMPTION OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING OTHER INPUTS OR ASSUMPTIONS, COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

OVERALL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT (E.G., UNEMPLOYMENT RATES), DELINQUENCY RATES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL (E.G., HOUSING PRICES), FICO SCORES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. WHILE ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE LEVELS, CHANGES IN THE VARIOUS FACTORS MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME OR AT THE SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE OTHER. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES OR BOTH.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT - WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM’S

METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL CREDIT LOSS FACTORS (ESTIMATED PD AND LGD) TO THE RECORDED INVESTMENT BALANCES OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OVER A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES.

THE FIRM

ASSESSES THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS BORROWER OR COUNTERPARTY AND ASSIGNS A RISK RATING. RISK RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED AT ORIGINATION OR ACQUISITION, AND IF NECESSARY, ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN CREDIT QUALITY OVER THE LIFE OF THE EXPOSURE. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN OR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENT, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. DETERMINING RISK RATINGS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT; EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY

THE FIRM.

PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL THROUGH-THE-CYCLE DATA, USING CREDIT RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS.

AN LGD ESTIMATE IS ASSIGNED TO EACH LOAN OR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENT. THE ESTIMATE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC LOSS IF THE OBLIGOR WERE TO DEFAULT. THE TYPE OF OBLIGOR, QUALITY OF COLLATERAL, AND THE SENIORITY OF

THE FIRM’S

LENDING EXPOSURE IN THE OBLIGOR’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE AFFECT LGD. LGD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON

THE FIRM’S

HISTORY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE. CHANGES TO THE TIME PERIOD USED FOR PD AND LGD ESTIMATES (FOR EXAMPLE, POINT-IN-TIME LOSS VERSUS LONGER-TERM VIEWS OF THE CREDIT CYCLE) COULD ALSO AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

THE FIRM

APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING PD, LGD, LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD AND LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. WHEREVER POSSIBLE,

THE FIRM

USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR

THE FIRM’S

OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES, BUT DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN

THE FIRM’S

SPECIFIC LOANS OR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND THOSE REFLECTED IN EXTERNAL AND

FIRM-

SPECIFIC HISTORICAL DATA COULD AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. ESTIMATES OF PD, LGD, LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD AND LOAN-EQUIVALENT USED ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REFINEMENT BASED ON ANY CHANGES TO UNDERLYING EXTERNAL

OR FIRM-

SPECIFIC HISTORICAL DATA. THE USE OF DIFFERENT INPUTS, ESTIMATES OR METHODOLOGIES COULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY

THE FIRM.

IN ADDITION TO THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES APPLIED TO WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES FOR WHOLESALE LOANS,

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LGD AND PD ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE RELATES TO LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, WHICH INCLUDES LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS AS WELL AS RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. TO DETERMINE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE SMALLER LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS POOLS USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. SCORED LOANS (I.E., CONSUMER LOANS) ARE POOLED BY PRODUCT TYPE, WHILE RISK-RATED LOANS (PRIMARILY WHOLESALE LOANS) ARE SEGMENTED BY RISK RATING.

THE FIRM

GENERALLY MEASURES THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN IMPAIRMENT ARE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED USING AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE, AND THE ALLOWANCE IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE LOAN’S FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL. FOR ANY OF THESE IMPAIRED LOANS, THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED, IF ANY, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN (INCLUDING PRIOR CHARGE-OFFS), EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND/OR FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS. SEE NOTE

14

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHARGE-OFFS AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF FORGONE INTEREST, IF ANY, IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION AND ALSO INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF THE MODIFICATION ON THE LOAN’S EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT. FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS,

THE FIRM

DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE APPLIED AT A LOAN LEVEL TO COMPUTE EXPECTED LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT,

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA.

THE FIRM

ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED MODIFIED LOANS. FOR CREDIT

228

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

CARD LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE PROJECTED REDEFAULTS BASED ON

THE FIRM’S

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE BY TYPE OF MODIFICATION PROGRAM. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF THE BORROWER’S ABILITY TO REPAY UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS.

ESTIMATING THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AS THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS RELY UPON ESTIMATES SUCH AS LOSS SEVERITIES, ASSET VALUATIONS, DEFAULT RATES (INCLUDING REDEFAULT RATES ON MODIFIED LOANS), THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS (INCLUDING ANY EXPECTED PREPAYMENTS) OR OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE, IN TURN, DEPENDENT ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE DURATION OF CURRENT OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY-, PORTFOLIO-, OR BORROWER-SPECIFIC FACTORS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS AS WELL AS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICES. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

PCI LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN PCI LOANS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON QUARTERLY ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS.

THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES REGARDING DEFAULT RATES (INCLUDING REDEFAULT RATES ON MODIFIED LOANS), LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICES, AND THE DURATION OF CURRENT OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

WRITE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS ARE RECORDED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN ACTUAL LOSSES FOR A POOL EXCEED ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. A WRITE-OFF OF A PCI LOAN IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS REMOVED FROM A POOL (E.G., UPON LIQUIDATION). DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, THE FIRM RECORDED A

$291 MILLION

ADJUSTMENT TO REDUCE THE PCI ALLOWANCE AND THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE FIRM’S PCI LOAN PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INTEREST FORGIVENESS MODIFICATIONS. THIS ADJUSTMENT HAD NO IMPACT TO THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

(B)

INCLUDES RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR.

(C)

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS RELATED TO LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR; SUCH ALLOWANCE IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE LOANS’ ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES AND DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY INCREMENTAL PENALTY RATES.

(D)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, THE FIRM NO LONGER INCLUDES WITHIN ITS DISCLOSURE OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF ADVISED UNCOMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT AS IT IS WITHIN THE FIRM’S DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT TO MAKE A LOAN UNDER THESE LINES, AND THE FIRM’S APPROVAL IS GENERALLY REQUIRED PRIOR TO FUNDING. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION.

THE FIRM’S OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

ARE ALSO INVOLVED WITH VIES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT, AS FOLLOWS.

•

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT: AWM SPONSORS AND MANAGES CERTAIN FUNDS THAT ARE DEEMED VIES. AS ASSET MANAGER OF THE FUNDS, AWM EARNS A FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUND’S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR FUND ENTITIES THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AWM’S INTERESTS ARE, IN CERTAIN CASES, CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE ENTITIES.

•

COMMERCIAL BANKING: CB

MAKES INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES LENDING TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES THAT MAY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE. IN ADDITION,

CB

PROVIDES FINANCING AND LENDING-RELATED SERVICES TO CERTAIN CLIENT-SPONSORED VIES. IN GENERAL,

CB

DOES NOT CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES

AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES.

•

CORPORATE

.

CORPORATE IS INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT MAY MEET THE DEFINITION OF VIES; HOWEVER THESE ENTITIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPECIALIZED INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATION OF INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VIES.

THE FIRM

ALSO INVESTS IN AND PROVIDES FINANCING AND OTHER SERVICES TO VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED ON

PAGE 237

OF THIS NOTE.

SIGNIFICANT FIRM-SPONSORED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD BUSINESS SECURITIZES BOTH ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE “TRUST”). THE FIRM’S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLER’S INTEREST IN THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND MAINTAINING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE FIRM IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THESE FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS BASED ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH ITS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER DUTIES, INCLUDING MAKING DECISIONS AS TO THE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE TRANSFERRED INTO THOSE TRUSTS AND AS TO ANY RELATED MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRM’S OTHER CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUSTS, AS INDICATED ABOVE, OBLIGATES THE FIRM TO ABSORB LOSSES AND GIVES THE FIRM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THESE VIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

THE UNDERLYING SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR PAYMENT OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE FIRM’S OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR THE CLAIMS OF THE FIRM’S CREDITORS.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS (GENERALLY

5%

). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM HELD UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OF

$8.9 BILLION

AND

$13.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES OWNED BY THOSE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY

16%

AND

22%

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

. AS OF BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM DID NOT RETAIN ANY SENIOR SECURITIES AND RETAINED

$5.3 BILLION

OF SUBORDINATED SECURITIES IN CERTAIN OF ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. THE FIRM’S UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS AND SECURITIES RETAINED ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

THE FIRM

SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY

CCB,

AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES BY EITHER

CCB OR CIB. CCB

GENERALLY RETAINS SERVICING FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS

IT

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED

,

AND FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED BY

CIB.

FOR SECURITIZATIONS OF LOANS SERVICED BY

CCB, THE FIRM

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE BECAUSE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATED TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS.

CCB

MAY ALSO RETAIN AN INTEREST UPON SECURITIZATION.

IN ADDITION,

CIB

ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING SECURITIES ISSUED BY

FIRM

-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. AS A RESULT,

CIB

AT TIMES RETAINS SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS) IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION, AND/OR REACQUIRES POSITIONS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIONS RETAINED OR REACQUIRED BY

CIB

OR HELD BY

CCB,

WHEN CONSIDERED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY

CCB, THE FIRM

IS DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF CERTAIN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON

PAGE 237

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION

(FIRM

-SPONSORED OR THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED) WHEN IT IS NOT THE SERVICER (AND THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE TRUST) OR DOES NOT HOLD A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE TRUST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUST. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE FIRM

DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS OF CERTAIN

FIRM

-SPONSORED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VIES, IN WHICH

THE FIRM

HAD CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT

THE FIRM

DID NOT HOLD AN INTEREST IN THESE TRUSTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON

PAGE 237

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS

CIB

ORIGINATES AND SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTS.

CIB

MAY RETAIN UNSOLD SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION BUT, GENERALLY,

THE FIRM

DOES NOT SERVICE COMMERCIAL LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE GENERALLY IS HELD BY THE SERVICER OR INVESTORS IN A SPECIFIED CLASS OF SECURITIES (“CONTROLLING CLASS”).

THE FIRM

GENERALLY DOES NOT RETAIN AN INTEREST IN THE CONTROLLING CLASS IN ITS SPONSORED COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. SEE THE TABLE ON

PAGE 237

THE FIRM

RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CERTAIN STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH THESE SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES. SEE THE TABLE ON

OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

RE-SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM ENGAGES IN CERTAIN RE-SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH DEBT SECURITIES ARE TRANSFERRED TO A VIE IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. THESE TRANSFERS OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH AGENCY (FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (“FANNIE MAE”), FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (“FREDDIE MAC”) AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (“GINNIE MAE”)) AND NONAGENCY (PRIVATE-LABEL) SPONSORED VIES, WHICH MAY BE BACKED BY EITHER RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ROLE AND INTEREST IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

2015

AND

2014

, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED

$11.2 BILLION

,

$21.9 BILLION

AND

$22.7 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO AGENCY VIES, AND

$647 MILLION

,

$777 MILLION

AND

$1.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO PRIVATE-LABEL VIES.

MOST RE-SECURITIZATIONS WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED ARE CLIENT-DRIVEN TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A SPECIFIC CLIENT OR GROUP OF CLIENTS IS SEEKING A SPECIFIC RETURN OR RISK PROFILE. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE DECISION-MAKING POWER OF THE ENTITY IS SHARED BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS CLIENTS, CONSIDERING THE JOINT EFFORT AND DECISIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST AND ITS ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST THE CLIENT HOLDS IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST; THEREFORE THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

IN MORE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM CREATES A NONAGENCY RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SPECIFIC CLIENTS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS MADE DURING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DESIGN OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE IF THE FIRM HOLDS AN INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MAY INVEST IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS OF THIRD-PARTY RE-SECURITIZATIONS AND GENERALLY PURCHASES THESE INTERESTS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST, EITHER BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL DESIGN OF THE TRUST, OR THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY SPONSOR AND DEMONSTRATES SHARED POWER OVER THE CREATION OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING, COLLATERALIZED BY POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS, TO CUSTOMERS OF

THE FIRM.

THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR FINANCING FACILITIES THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS BY THE CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS, AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE

THE FIRM’S

POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONDUITS.

TO ENSURE TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND TO PROVIDE THE CONDUITS WITH FUNDING TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS IN THE EVENT THAT THE CONDUITS DO NOT OBTAIN FUNDING IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT VEHICLES WITH UNCOMMITTED PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED IS BASED UPON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE AND APPROXIMATES

10%

OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER.

THE FIRM

CONSOLIDATES ITS

FIRM

-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS

THE FIRM

HAS BOTH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONDUITS AND A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE CONDUITS. AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND IN ITS ROLE IN STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS,

THE FIRM

MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING ASSET TYPES AND CREDIT QUALITY, AND MANAGES THE COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING NEEDS OF THE CONDUITS.

THE FIRM’S

INTERESTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIES INCLUDE THE FEES RECEIVED AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LIQUIDITY AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE CREATED BY THE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS. SEE

THE FIRM OR THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS PROVIDE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS TO CERTAIN CLIENTS OF THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS.

THE UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS WERE

$7.4 BILLION

AND

$5.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

VIES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY,

THE FIRM

CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE VIES, TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVES, TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS.

THE FIRM

MAY ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH

THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH

THE FIRM

IS ENGAGED IN ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES OR TENDER OPTION BOND (“TOB”) TRUSTS ALLOW INVESTORS TO FINANCE THEIR MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM RATES. IN A TYPICAL TOB TRANSACTION, THE TRUST PURCHASES HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BOND(S) OF A SINGLE ISSUER AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF SECURITIES: (1) PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES (“FLOATERS”) AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS (“RESIDUALS”). THE FLOATERS ARE TYPICALLY PURCHASED BY MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR OTHER SHORT-TERM INVESTORS AND MAY BE TENDERED, WITH REQUISITE NOTICE, TO THE TOB TRUST. THE RESIDUALS ARE RETAINED BY THE INVESTOR SEEKING TO FINANCE ITS MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENT.

TOB TRANSACTIONS WHERE THE RESIDUAL IS HELD BY A THIRD PARTY INVESTOR ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS CUSTOMER TOB TRUSTS, AND NON-CUSTOMER TOB TRUSTS ARE TRANSACTIONS WHERE THE RESIDUAL IS RETAINED BY

THE FIRM. THE FIRM

SERVES AS SPONSOR FOR ALL NON-CUSTOMER TOB TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN CUSTOMER TOB TRANSACTIONS ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO 2014.

THE FIRM

MAY PROVIDE VARIOUS SERVICES TO A TOB TRUST, INCLUDING

REMARKETING AGENT,

LIQUIDITY OR TENDER OPTION PROVIDER, AND/OR SPONSOR.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

235

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC MAY SERVE AS A REMARKETING AGENT ON THE FLOATERS FOR TOB TRUSTS. THE REMARKETING AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING THE PERIODIC VARIABLE RATE ON THE FLOATERS, CONDUCTING THE INITIAL PLACEMENT AND REMARKETING TENDERED FLOATERS. THE REMARKETING AGENT MAY, BUT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE MARKETS IN FLOATERS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

, THE FIRM HELD AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FLOATERS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND DID NOT HOLD ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS DURING

2016

AND

2015.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. OR J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC

OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY OR TENDER OPTION PROVIDER FOR THE TOB TRUSTS. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN EVENTS (“TERMINATION EVENTS”), WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. IN ADDITION, THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER’S EXPOSURE IS TYPICALLY FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE, OR, IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL HOLDERS.

HOLDERS OF THE FLOATERS MAY “PUT,” OR TENDER, THEIR FLOATERS TO THE TOB TRUST. IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATERS TO ANOTHER INVESTOR, THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EITHER PROVIDES A LOAN TO THE TOB TRUST FOR  THE TOB TRUST’S PURCHASE OF THE FLOATERS, OR IT DIRECTLY PURCHASES THE TENDERED FLOATERS. IN CERTAIN CUSTOMER TOB TRANSACTIONS,

THE FIRM,

AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, HAS ENTERED INTO A REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RESIDUAL HOLDER. IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS, UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE, IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY AMOUNTS OWED TO

THE FIRM,

AS LIQUIDITY OR TENDER OPTION PROVIDER,

THE FIRM

HAS RECOURSE TO THE THIRD PARTY RESIDUAL HOLDERS FOR ANY SHORTFALL. RESIDUAL HOLDERS WITH REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL WITH

THE FIRM

TO SUPPORT SUCH REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS SHOULD THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINE.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT RESIDUAL HOLDERS FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS.

TOB TRUSTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

THE FIRM

CONSOLIDATES NON-CUSTOMER TOB TRUSTS BECAUSE AS THE RESIDUAL HOLDER,

THE FIRM

HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE, AND IT HAS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AND BEAR LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE CUSTOMER TOB TRUSTS, SINCE

THE FIRM

DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE. CERTAIN NON-CONSOLIDATED CUSTOMER TOB TRUSTS ARE SPONSORED BY A THIRD PARTY, AND NOT

THE FIRM. SEE

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

THE FIRM

ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT,

REMARKETING AGENT,

TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARM’S-LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE

THE FIRM

DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OR A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT,

THE FIRM

RECORDS AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN THE SAME MANNER IT WOULD RECORD AND REPORT POSITIONS IN RESPECT OF ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM

HAS SECURITIZED AND SOLD A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD, STUDENT AND COMMERCIAL (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE) LOANS, AS WELL AS DEBT SECURITIES. THE PURPOSES OF THESE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WERE TO SATISFY INVESTOR DEMAND AND TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR

THE FIRM.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IN WHICH

THE FIRM

IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE TRUST,

THE FIRM

RECORDS THE TRANSFER OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE TO THE TRUST AS A SALE WHEN ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET: (1) THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM

THE FIRM’S

CREDITORS; (2) THE TRANSFEREE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST

HOLDER CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS; AND (3)

THE FIRM

DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G.,

THE FIRM

CANNOT REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS).

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE,

THE FIRM

RECOGNIZES A GAIN OR LOSS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED (INCLUDING CASH, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, OR SERVICING ASSETS RECEIVED) AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS SOLD. GAINS AND LOSSES ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY TABLES ABOVE,

THE FIRM,

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, SELLS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED MORTGAGE LOANS AND CERTAIN ORIGINATED EXCESS MSRS ON A NONRECOURSE BASIS, PREDOMINANTLY TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES (“U.S. GSES”). THESE LOANS AND EXCESS MSRS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURITIZATION BY THE U.S. GSES, WHO PROVIDE CERTAIN GUARANTEE PROVISIONS (E.G., CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF THE LOANS).

THE FIRM

ALSO SELLS LOANS INTO SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO GINNIE MAE

GUIDELINES; THESE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY ANOTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

THE FIRM

DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES UNDERLYING THESE TRANSACTIONS AS IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN SALES,

THE FIRM

NOTE 17 – GOODWILL AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED UPON COMPLETION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION, GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT.

THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE RELATED REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE DETERMINED BASED ON HOW THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED AND HOW THEY ARE REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS GOODWILL ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

THE FIRM’S GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

. FURTHER, EXCEPT FOR GOODWILL RELATED TO ITS HERITAGE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS OF

$276 MILLION

, THE FIRM’S GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF

EACH REPORTING UNIT

IS COMPARED WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN THE

REPORTING UNIT’S

GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE

REPORTING UNIT’S

GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNIT

(AS DETERMINED IN STEP ONE) TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF

THE REPORTING UNIT,

AS IF

THE REPORTING UNIT WERE

BEING ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE RESULTING IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNIT’S

GOODWILL.

IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IS LESS THAN ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

THE FIRM USES THE REPORTING UNITS’ ALLOCATED EQUITY PLUS GOODWILL CAPITAL AS A PROXY FOR THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EQUITY FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. REPORTING UNIT EQUITY IS DETERMINED ON A SIMILAR BASIS AS THE ALLOCATION OF EQUITY TO THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPITAL THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III) AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. PROPOSED LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY LEVELS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS, WHICH IS REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ALLOCATED EQUITY IS FURTHER REVIEWED ON A PERIODIC BASIS AND UPDATED AS NEEDED.

240

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

THE PRIMARY METHOD THE FIRM USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS THE INCOME APPROACH. THIS APPROACH PROJECTS CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND USES THE PERPETUITY GROWTH METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUES. THESE CASH FLOWS AND TERMINAL VALUES ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. PROJECTIONS OF CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS’ EARNINGS FORECASTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AND WHICH ARE REVIEWED WITH THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF EQUITY FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT AND IS DETERMINED CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY (ESTIMATED USING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL), AS ADJUSTED FOR THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO EACH REPORTING UNIT (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK OR UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS OR MANAGEMENT’S FORECASTS AND ASSUMPTIONS). TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT MANAGEMENT COMPARES THE DISCOUNT RATE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF EQUITY (AGGREGATING THE VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS) IS COMPARED WITH THE FIRMS’ OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS.

THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH MARKET-BASED TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES FOR RELEVANT COMPETITORS. TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED AS GENERAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE GENERAL REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ALTHOUGH PRECISE CONCLUSIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE DRAWN DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES THAT NATURALLY EXIST BETWEEN THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S MARKET CAPITALIZATION. IN EVALUATING THIS COMPARISON, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING (I) A CONTROL PREMIUM THAT WOULD EXIST IN A MARKET TRANSACTION, (II) FACTORS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION RISK THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL THAT DO NOT EXIST AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AND (III) SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS.

DECLINES IN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, INCREASES IN CREDIT LOSSES, INCREASES IN EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS, ESTIMATES OF ADVERSE REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED MARKET COST OF EQUITY, COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF

THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR

ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MSRS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. THE FAIR VALUE CONSIDERS ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICING FEES AND ANCILLARY REVENUE, OFFSET BY ESTIMATED COSTS TO SERVICE THE LOANS, AND GENERALLY DECLINES OVER TIME AS NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS ARE RECEIVED, EFFECTIVELY AMORTIZING THE MSR ASSET AGAINST CONTRACTUAL SERVICING AND ANCILLARY FEE INCOME. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RECOGNIZED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS IF SERVICING IS RETAINED.

AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP,

THE FIRM

HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS MSRS AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM

TREATS ITS MSRS AS A SINGLE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS MSR ASSET AND ITS TREATMENT OF MSRS AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (“OAS”) MODEL, WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE FIRM’S

PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, COSTS TO SERVICE, LATE CHARGES AND OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS.

THE FIRM

COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, AND ALSO CONSIDERS RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

241

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. MSRS TYPICALLY DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE BECAUSE DECLINING INTEREST RATES TEND TO INCREASE PREPAYMENTS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS THAT COMPRISE THE MSR ASSET. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (E.G., MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (I.E.,

THOSE FOR WHICH

THE FIRM

RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES TO MANAGE THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY INTEREST-RATE RELATED CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SERVICER ADVANCES IS MINIMAL BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ADVANCES IS TYPICALLY SENIOR TO ALL CASH PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS THE RIGHT TO STOP PAYMENT TO INVESTORS IF THE COLLATERAL IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE ADVANCE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF THESE SERVICER ADVANCES MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IF THEY WERE NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE RULES AND AGREEMENTS.

(E)

FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE NEGATIVE IMPACT WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE MORTGAGE SERVICING BUSINESS, WHICH, IN TURN, RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE OAS.

IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 26 – INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF

THE FIRM’S

BUSINESSES, AND FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

THE FIRM

FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THUS,

THE FIRM’S

FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, NON-U.S. INCOME IS DEFINED AS INCOME GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. BASED ON

JPMORGAN CHASE’S

250

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

ONGOING REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS,

THE FIRM

HAS DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES. AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FOR

2016

,

PRETAX EARNINGS OF

$3.8 BILLION

WERE GENERATED AND WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES WERE

$38.4 BILLION.

IF

THE FIRM

WERE TO RECORD A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT WOULD BE

$8.8 BILLION

(D)

THE TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IS NOT A RISK-BASED MEASURE OF CAPITAL. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE ASSETS.

NOTE.

RATING AGENCIES ALLOW MEASURES OF CAPITAL TO BE ADJUSTED UPWARD FOR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WHICH HAVE RESULTED FROM BOTH NON-TAXABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND FROM TAX-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL. THE FIRM HAD DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM NON-TAXABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OF

$83 MILLION

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF CET1, TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RWA, AS WELL AS A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO (WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED QUARTERLY AVERAGE ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION. NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS.

NOTE 29 – OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO

THE FIRM

SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR

THE FIRM

BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES ARE REFINANCED, EXTENDED, CANCELLED, OR EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN

THE FIRM’S

VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

TO PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LENDING-COMMITMENTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED.

SEE NOTE 15

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015.

THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

THE FIRM

HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME.

THE FIRM

CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL CREDIT CARD LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES AS PERMITTED BY LAW, WITHOUT NOTICE.

IN ADDITION,

THE FIRM

TYPICALLY CLOSES CREDIT CARD LINES WHEN THE BORROWER IS

60 DAYS

OR MORE PAST DUE.

THE FIRM

MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HELOCS WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY, OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT GENERALLY CONSIST OF COMMITMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES AND BOND FINANCINGS IN THE EVENT THAT THOSE OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE REMARKETED TO NEW INVESTORS, AS WELL AS COMMITTED LIQUIDITY FACILITIES TO CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS.

THE FIRM

ALSO ISSUES COMMITMENTS UNDER MULTIPURPOSE FACILITIES WHICH COULD BE DRAWN UPON IN SEVERAL FORMS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT.

THE FIRM

ACTS AS A SETTLEMENT AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. IN ITS ROLE AS SETTLEMENT AND CUSTODY BANK,

THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED TO THE INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF ITS CASH BORROWER CLIENTS, USUALLY BROKER-DEALERS.

THIS EXPOSURE ARISES UNDER SECURED CLEARANCE ADVANCE FACILITIES THAT

THE FIRM

EXTENDS TO ITS CLIENTS (I.E. CASH BORROWERS); THESE FACILITIES CONTRACTUALLY LIMIT

THE FIRM’S

INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK TO THE FACILITY AMOUNT

AND MUST BE REPAID BY THE END OF THE DAY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

,

THE SECURED CLEARANCE ADVANCE FACILITY MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING COMMITMENT AMOUNT WAS

$2.4 BILLION

AND

$2.9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

GUARANTEES

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. U.S. GAAP DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTY’S FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT.

THE FIRM

CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER U.S. GAAP: STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP,

THE FIRM

INITIALLY RECORDS GUARANTEES AT THE INCEPTION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION

ASSUMED (E.G., THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE). FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GUARANTEES,

THE FIRM

RECORDS THIS FAIR VALUE AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN CASH (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVED), OR OTHER ASSETS (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE). ANY PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IS REDUCED AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. FOR INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED IN SALES AGREEMENTS, A PORTION OF THE SALE PROCEEDS IS ALLOCATED TO THE GUARANTEE, WHICH ADJUSTS THE GAIN OR LOSS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT FROM THE TRANSACTION. FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, THE INITIAL LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED TO INCOME AS

THE FIRM’S

RISK IS REDUCED (I.E., OVER TIME OR WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES). ANY CONTINGENT LIABILITY THAT EXISTS AS A RESULT OF ISSUING THE GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION IS RECOGNIZED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE CONTINGENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT RECOGNIZED IF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION (ADJUSTED FOR ANY AMORTIZATION).

THE RECORDED AMOUNTS OF THE LIABILITIES RELATED TO GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

,

EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY

THE FIRM

TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. THE CARRYING VALUES OF STANDBY AND OTHER LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS

THROUGH

THE FIRM’S

SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS’ SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM,

THE FIRM

PROVIDES AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING AGREEMENTS WHICH PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES. TO MINIMIZE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS,

THE FIRM

OBTAINS CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING

100%

OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL MAY BE RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS,

THE FIRM

WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF.

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

THE FIRM

TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE

THE FIRM

TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON EXERCISE BY THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM

MAY ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT OPTION CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR OTHER TRADING PURPOSES. THE TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVES DEEMED TO BE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTS SUCH AS STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE

THE FIRM

TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTY’S REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “STABLE VALUE WRAPS,” ARE TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO REALIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO AND ARE TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM OR MAY HAVE NO STATED MATURITY, BUT ALLOW

THE FIRM

TO ELECT TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

DERIVATIVES DEEMED TO BE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES.

THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT

THE FIRM

DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS

$52.0 BILLION

AND

$53.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

,

RESPECTIVELY. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT GENERALLY REPRESENTS

THE FIRM’S

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN STABLE VALUE CONTRACTS IS CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT; THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT ON THESE STABLE VALUE CONTRACTS WAS

$28.7 BILLION

AND

$28.4 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

,

RESPECTIVELY, AND THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS WAS

$3.0 BILLION

AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS REFLECT THE PROBABILITY OF WHETHER

THE FIRM

WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO DERIVATIVES THAT

THE FIRM

DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WERE DERIVATIVE PAYABLES OF

$96 MILLION

AND

$236 MILLION

AND DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF

$16 MILLION

AND

$14 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

2015

,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM

REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING

INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS, OR BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES.

IN ADDITION TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE,

THE FIRM

IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE

6.

UNSETTLED REVERSE REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS, AND UNSETTLED REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS,

THE FIRM

ENTERS INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS. SUCH AGREEMENTS SETTLE AT A FUTURE DATE. AT SETTLEMENT, THESE COMMITMENTS RESULT IN

THE FIRM

ADVANCING CASH TO AND RECEIVING SECURITIES COLLATERAL FROM THE COUNTERPARTY.

THE FIRM

ALSO ENTERS INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS. AT SETTLEMENT, THESE COMMITMENTS RESULT IN

IN CONNECTION WITH

THE FIRM’S

MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH GSES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE

16, THE FIRM

HAS MADE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE

THE FIRM

TO REPURCHASE MORTGAGE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE LOAN PURCHASER. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH

THE FIRM’S

SECURITIZATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE,

THE FIRM

DOES PROVIDE RECOURSE SERVICING IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES WHERE IT AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS. TO THE EXTENT THAT REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT ARE RECEIVED RELATE TO LOANS THAT

THE FIRM

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES THAT REMAIN VIABLE,

THE FIRM

TYPICALLY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE THIRD PARTY. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS

THE FIRM

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SUCH LOANS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFECTS THAT WERE SOLD TO PURCHASERS (INCLUDING SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES) PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

PRIVATE LABEL SECURITIZATIONS

THE LIABILITY RELATED TO REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVATE LABEL SECURITIZATIONS IS SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY

THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM

PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO

THE FIRM

IS THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON RECOURSE SERVICING PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE LOAN AND THE COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY.

THE FIRM’S

SECURITIZATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS – GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS,

THE FIRM

MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT REQUIRE

THE FIRM

TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW

THE FIRM

TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN LIEU OF MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE.

THE FIRM

MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (“SOFTWARE LICENSEES”) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (“THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS”), PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY

THE FIRM

PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

THE FIRM’S

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST

THE FIRM

THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

CARD CHARGE-BACKS

COMMERCE SOLUTIONS, CARD’S MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS, IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN PAYMENT PROCESSING AND MERCHANT ACQUIRING.

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS PRIMARILY LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBER’S FAVOR, COMMERCE SOLUTIONS WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBER’S

ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF COMMERCE SOLUTIONS IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, COMMERCE SOLUTIONS WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. COMMERCE SOLUTIONS MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; (2) COMMERCE SOLUTIONS DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND (3) COMMERCE SOLUTIONS DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD RECOGNIZE THE LOSS.

COMMERCE SOLUTIONS INCURRED AGGREGATE LOSSES OF

CLEARING SERVICES – CLIENT CREDIT RISK

THE FIRM

PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES FOR CLIENTS BY ENTERING INTO SECURITIES PURCHASES AND SALES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH CCPS, INCLUDING ETDS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS OTC-CLEARED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER,

THE FIRM

STANDS BEHIND THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS CLIENTS, COLLECTS CASH AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL (MARGIN) AS WELL AS ANY SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS DUE FROM OR TO CLIENTS, AND REMITS THEM TO THE RELEVANT CCP OR CLIENT IN WHOLE OR PART. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF MARGIN: VARIATION MARGIN IS POSTED ON A DAILY BASIS BASED ON THE VALUE OF CLIENTS’ DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND INITIAL MARGIN IS POSTED AT INCEPTION OF A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, GENERALLY ON THE BASIS OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENT FOR THE CONTRACT.

AS CLEARING MEMBER,

THE FIRM

IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS, BUT IS NOT LIABLE TO CLIENTS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CCPS. WHERE POSSIBLE,

THE FIRM

SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS RISK TO THE CLIENT THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF MARGIN AT INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

THE FIRM

CAN ALSO CEASE PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES IF CLIENTS DO NOT ADHERE TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEARING AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY A CLIENT,

THE FIRM

WOULD CLOSE OUT THE CLIENT’S POSITIONS AND ACCESS AVAILABLE MARGIN. THE CCP WOULD UTILIZE ANY MARGIN IT HOLDS TO MAKE ITSELF WHOLE, WITH ANY REMAINING SHORTFALLS REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY

THE FIRM

AS A CLEARING MEMBER.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM

REFLECTS ITS EXPOSURE TO NONPERFORMANCE RISK OF THE CLIENT THROUGH THE RECOGNITION OF MARGIN PAYABLES OR RECEIVABLES TO CLIENTS AND CCPS; THE CLIENTS’ UNDERLYING SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

THE FIRM’S

MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE THROUGH ITS ROLE AS A CLEARING MEMBER, AS THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF TRANSACTIONS THAT CLIENTS MAY EXECUTE IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND THE CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS AVAILABLE TO

THE FIRM,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT

THE FIRM

WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE RISK OF LOSS IS EXPECTED TO BE REMOTE.

FOR INFORMATION ON THE DERIVATIVES THAT

THE FIRM

EXECUTES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND RECORDS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SEE NOTE

EXCHANGE & CLEARING HOUSE MEMBERSHIPS

THE FIRM

IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE EXCHANGES AND CLEARING HOUSES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IT PROVIDES CLEARING SERVICES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES

THE FIRM

TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF

THE FIRM’S

CONTRIBUTION TO THE GUARANTEE FUND MAINTAINED BY A CLEARING HOUSE OR EXCHANGE AS PART OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO COVER ANY LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A MEMBER DEFAULT. ALTERNATIVELY, THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE RESIDUAL LOSSES AFTER APPLYING THE GUARANTEE FUND. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CLEARING HOUSES REQUIRE

THE FIRM

AS A MEMBER TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE CLEARING HOUSE’S INVESTMENT OF GUARANTEE FUND CONTRIBUTIONS AND INITIAL MARGIN, UNRELATED TO AND INDEPENDENT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. GENERALLY A PAYMENT WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED SHOULD SUCH LOSSES EXCEED THE RESOURCES OF THE CLEARING HOUSE OR EXCHANGE THAT ARE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO ABSORB THE LOSSES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE

THE FIRM’S

MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST

THE FIRM

THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS,

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“PARENT COMPANY”)

MAY PROVIDE COUNTERPARTIES WITH GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN OF THE TRADING AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES

ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH

THE FIRM’S

COUNTERPARTIES. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED ON

THE FIRM’S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR ARE REFLECTED AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS; THEREFORE,

THE PARENT COMPANY

HAS NOT RECOGNIZED A SEPARATE LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT THAT WOULD TRIGGER PAYMENTS BY

THE PARENT COMPANY

UNDER THESE GUARANTEES IS REMOTE.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC (“JPMFC”), A

100%

-OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY. ALL SECURITIES ISSUED BY JPMFC ARE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE PARENT COMPANY. THESE GUARANTEES, WHICH RANK ON A PARITY WITH THE FIRM’S UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ON

NOTE 31 – LITIGATION

CONTINGENCIES

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE DEFENDANTS OR PUTATIVE DEFENDANTS IN NUMEROUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PRIVATE, CIVIL LITIGATIONS AND REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. THE LITIGATIONS RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS INVOLVING A SINGLE PLAINTIFF TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WITH POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF CLASS MEMBERS. INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVE BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS, BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE AT VARYING STAGES OF ADJUDICATION, ARBITRATION OR INVESTIGATION, AND INVOLVE EACH OF THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING COMMON LAW TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AND STATUTORY ANTITRUST, SECURITIES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS), SOME OF WHICH PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF RESERVES ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS FROM

$0

TO APPROXIMATELY

$3.0 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. THIS ESTIMATED AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES WAS BASED UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT AN ESTIMATE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS CAN BE MADE. FOR CERTAIN MATTERS, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE, AS OF THAT DATE. THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, GIVEN THE NUMBER, VARIETY AND VARYING STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY ARE IN PRELIMINARY STAGES), THE EXISTENCE IN MANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS OF MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) WHOSE SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED, THE NUMEROUS YET-UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MANY OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING ISSUES REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THE SCOPE OF MANY OF THE CLAIMS) AND THE ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHERE THE FIRM HAS MADE ASSUMPTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE RULINGS BY THE COURT OR OTHER ADJUDICATOR, OR ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OR INCENTIVES OF ADVERSE PARTIES OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, AND THOSE ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE INCORRECT. IN ADDITION, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR PROCEEDING MAY BE A RESULT WHICH THE FIRM DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ITS ESTIMATE BECAUSE THE FIRM HAD DEEMED THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL LOSSES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.

SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

CIO LITIGATION.

THE FIRM HAS BEEN SUED IN A CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION, AND IN A CONSOLIDATED PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (“ERISA”), RELATING TO 2012 LOSSES IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO FORMERLY MANAGED BY THE FIRM’S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”). A SETTLEMENT OF THE

SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION, UNDER WHICH THE FIRM PAID

$150 MILLION

, HAS RECEIVED FULL AND FINAL APPROVAL FROM THE COURT. THE PUTATIVE ERISA CLASS ACTION HAS BEEN DISMISSED. THAT DISMISSAL WAS AFFIRMED BY THE APPELLATE COURT, AND A REQUEST BY THE PLAINTIFFS FOR REHEARING BY THE FULL APPELLATE COURT WAS DENIED.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

THE FIRM PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SETTLEMENTS WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES RELATING TO ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE (“FX”) SALES AND TRADING ACTIVITIES AND CONTROLS RELATED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES. FX-RELATED INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUIRIES BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING COMPETITION AUTHORITIES, ARE ONGOING, AND THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THOSE MATTERS. IN MAY 2015, THE FIRM PLEADED GUILTY TO A SINGLE VIOLATION OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW, AND IN JANUARY 2017, THE FIRM WAS SENTENCED, WITH JUDGMENT ENTERED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR GRANTED THE FIRM A TEMPORARY

ONE

-YEAR WAIVER, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, TO ALLOW THE FIRM AND ITS AFFILIATES TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY FOR THE QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ASSET MANAGER EXEMPTION UNDER ERISA. THE FIRM’S APPLICATION FOR A LENGTHIER EXEMPTION IS PENDING. SEPARATELY, IN FEBRUARY 2017 THE SOUTH AFRICA COMPETITION COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD REFERRED ITS FX INVESTIGATION OF THE FIRM AND OTHER BANKS TO THE SOUTH AFRICA COMPETITION TRIBUNAL TO COMMENCE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS.

THE FIRM IS ALSO

ONE

OF A NUMBER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALERS DEFENDING A CLASS ACTION FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BY U.S.-BASED PLAINTIFFS, PRINCIPALLY ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS BASED ON AN ALLEGED CONSPIRACY TO MANIPULATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES (THE “U.S. CLASS ACTION”). IN JANUARY 2015, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE U.S. CLASS ACTION. FOLLOWING THIS SETTLEMENT, A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED SEEKING DAMAGES FOR PERSONS WHO TRANSACTED FX FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON FUTURES (THE “EXCHANGED-BASED ACTIONS”), CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED FOREIGN CURRENCIES AT ALLEGEDLY INFLATED RATES (THE “CONSUMER ACTION”), PARTICIPANTS OR BENEFICIARIES OF QUALIFIED ERISA PLANS (THE “ERISA ACTIONS”), AND PURPORTED INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF FX INSTRUMENTS (THE “INDIRECT PURCHASER ACTION”). SINCE THEN, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO A REVISED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE CONSOLIDATED U.S. CLASS ACTION, INCLUDING THE EXCHANGE-BASED ACTIONS, AND THAT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PRELIMINARILY APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS DISMISSED

ONE

OF THE ERISA ACTIONS, AND THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN APPEAL. THE CONSUMER ACTION, A SECOND ERISA ACTION AND THE INDIRECT PURCHASER ACTION REMAIN PENDING IN THE DISTRICT COURT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2015,

TWO

CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED IN CANADA AGAINST THE FIRM AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER FX DEALERS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION ACT BASED ON AN ALLEGED CONSPIRACY TO FIX THE PRICES OF CURRENCY PURCHASED IN THE FX MARKET. THE FIRST ACTION WAS FILED IN THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO, AND SEEKS TO REPRESENT ALL PERSONS IN CANADA WHO TRANSACTED ANY FX

262

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

INSTRUMENT. THE SECOND ACTION WAS FILED IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC, AND SEEKS AUTHORIZATION TO REPRESENT ONLY THOSE PERSONS IN QUEBEC WHO ENGAGED IN FX TRANSACTIONS. IN LATE 2016, THE FIRM SETTLED THE CANADIAN CLASS ACTIONS; THOSE SETTLEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

GENERAL MOTORS LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. PARTICIPATED IN, AND WAS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ON BEHALF OF A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS ON, A

$1.5 BILLION

SYNDICATED TERM LOAN FACILITY (“TERM LOAN”) FOR GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION (“GM”). IN JULY 2009, IN CONNECTION WITH THE GM BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS OF MOTORS LIQUIDATION COMPANY (“CREDITORS COMMITTEE”) FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR OTHER LENDERS ON THE TERM LOAN, SEEKING TO HOLD THE UNDERLYING LIEN INVALID BASED ON THE FILING OF A UCC-3 TERMINATION STATEMENT RELATING TO THE TERM LOAN. IN JANUARY 2015, FOLLOWING SEVERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT REVERSED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT’S DISMISSAL OF THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE’S CLAIM AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE AS TO THE TERMINATION STATEMENT. THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CONTINUE WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADDITIONAL DEFENSES ASSERTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE VALUE OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL ON THE TERM LOAN THAT WAS UNAFFECTED BY THE FILING OF THE TERMINATION STATEMENT AT ISSUE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN TERM LOAN LENDERS FILED CROSS-CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION AND ASSERTING VARIOUS CLAIMS.

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION.

A GROUP OF MERCHANTS AND RETAIL ASSOCIATIONS FILED A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS ALLEGING THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD, AS WELL AS CERTAIN BANKS, CONSPIRED TO SET THE PRICE OF CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES, ENACTED RESPECTIVE RULES IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS, AND ENGAGED IN TYING/BUNDLING AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING. THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE CASES FOR A CASH PAYMENT OF

$6.1 BILLION

TO THE CLASS PLAINTIFFS (OF WHICH THE FIRM’S SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY

20%

) AND AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

TEN

BASIS POINTS OF CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FOR A PERIOD OF

EIGHT

MONTHS TO BE MEASURED FROM A DATE WITHIN

60 DAYS

OF THE END OF THE OPT-OUT PERIOD. THE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR MODIFICATIONS TO EACH CREDIT CARD NETWORK’S RULES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT.

A NUMBER OF MERCHANTS APPEALED TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT, WHICH, IN JUNE 2016, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURT’S CERTIFICATION OF THE CLASS ACTION AND REVERSED THE APPROVAL OF THE CLASS SETTLEMENT. THE CASE HAS BEEN REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPELLATE DECISION. BOTH THE PLAINTIFFS AND THE DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED PETITIONS SEEKING REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT’S DECISION.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN MERCHANTS HAVE FILED INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD, AS WELL AS AGAINST THE FIRM AND OTHER BANKS, AND THOSE ACTIONS ARE PROCEEDING.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LITIGATION.

THE FIRM IS DEFENDING

TWO

PENDING CASES THAT ARE COORDINATED FOR PRE-TRIAL AND TRIAL PURPOSES, ALLEGING THAT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS MANAGED BY J.P. MORGAN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (“JPMIM”) WERE INAPPROPRIATELY INVESTED IN SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL. PLAINTIFFS ASSURED GUARANTY (U.K.) AND AMBAC ASSURANCE UK LIMITED CLAIM THAT JPMIM IS LIABLE FOR TOTAL LOSSES OF MORE THAN

$1 BILLION

IN MARKET VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES. DISCOVERY HAS BEEN COMPLETED. IN JANUARY 2016, PLAINTIFFS FILED A JOINT PARTIAL MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN THE COORDINATED ACTIONS. IN FEBRUARY 2017, THE COURT RULED IN PLAINTIFFS’ FAVOR AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF AN APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROVISION AND THE REJECTION OF A CERTAIN DEFENSE, BUT OTHERWISE PRESERVED FOR TRIAL THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER JPMIM BREACHED THE GOVERNING CONTRACT AND IS LIABLE FOR PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMED LOSSES UNDER THE STANDARD OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN MARCH 2017.

LEHMAN BROTHERS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

IN JANUARY 2016, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (“LBHI”) AND SEVERAL OF LBHI’S SUBSIDIARIES REACHED AN AGREEMENT, APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, RESOLVING SEVERAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE JANUARY 2016 SETTLEMENT DID NOT RESOLVE THE FOLLOWING REMAINING MATTERS: IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT PROCEEDINGS, LBHI AND ITS OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS FILED AN OBJECTION TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AGAINST LBHI WITH RESPECT TO CLEARING ADVANCES MADE TO LEHMAN BROTHERS INC., PRINCIPALLY ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE FIRM HAD NOT CONDUCTED THE SALE OF THE SECURITIES COLLATERAL HELD FOR ITS CLAIMS IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MANNER. LBHI ALSO BROUGHT

TWO

CLAIMS OBJECTIONS RELATING TO SECURITIES LENDING CLAIMS AND A GROUP OF OTHER SMALLER CLAIMS. IN JANUARY 2017, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ALL OF THESE REMAINING CLAIMS, AND THIS SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

LIBOR AND OTHER BENCHMARK RATE INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND, IN SOME CASES, INTERVIEWS, FROM FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (“DOJ”), THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (“CFTC”), THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (“SEC”) AND VARIOUS STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (“EC”), THE U.K. FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (“FCA”), THE CANADIAN COMPETITION BUREAU, THE SWISS COMPETITION COMMISSION (“COMCO”) AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND BANKING ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE WORLD RELATING PRIMARILY TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH INTEREST RATES WERE SUBMITTED TO THE BRITISH BANKERS ASSOCIATION (“BBA”) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTING OF THE BBA’S LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (“LIBOR”) FOR VARIOUS CURRENCIES, PRINCIPALLY IN 2007 AND 2008. SOME OF THE INQUIRIES ALSO RELATE TO SIMILAR PROCESSES BY WHICH INFORMATION ON RATES IS SUBMITTED TO THE EUROPEAN

BANKING FEDERATION (“EBF”) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTING OF THE EBF’S EURO INTERBANK OFFERED RATES (“EURIBOR”) AND TO THE JAPANESE BANKERS’ ASSOCIATION FOR THE SETTING OF TOKYO INTERBANK OFFERED RATES (“TIBOR”), AS WELL AS PROCESSES FOR THE SETTING OF U.S. DOLLAR ISDAFIX RATES AND OTHER REFERENCE RATES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD DURING SIMILAR TIME PERIODS. THE FIRM IS RESPONDING TO AND CONTINUING TO COOPERATE WITH THESE INQUIRIES. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE FIRM HAS RESOLVED EC INQUIRIES RELATING TO YEN LIBOR AND SWISS FRANC LIBOR. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE FIRM RESOLVED COMCO INQUIRIES RELATING TO THESE SAME RATES. COMCO’S INVESTIGATION RELATING TO EURIBOR, TO WHICH THE FIRM AND OTHER BANKS ARE SUBJECT, CONTINUES. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE EC ISSUED A DECISION AGAINST THE FIRM AND OTHER BANKS FINDING AN INFRINGEMENT OF EUROPEAN ANTITRUST RULES RELATING TO EURIBOR. THE FIRM HAS FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN GENERAL COURT. IN JUNE 2016, THE DOJ INFORMED THE FIRM THAT THE DOJ HAD CLOSED ITS INQUIRY INTO LIBOR AND OTHER BENCHMARK RATES WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRM WITHOUT TAKING ACTION. OTHER INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED WITHOUT ANY ACTION AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE, INCLUDING BY THE SEC, FCA AND THE CANADIAN COMPETITION BUREAU.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT ALONG WITH OTHER BANKS IN A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN VARIOUS UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES, IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN THESE ACTIONS, PLAINTIFFS MAKE VARYING ALLEGATIONS THAT IN VARIOUS PERIODS, STARTING IN 2000 OR LATER, DEFENDANTS EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY MANIPULATED THE U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, YEN LIBOR, SWISS FRANC LIBOR, EUROYEN TIBOR, EURIBOR, SINGAPORE INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (“SIBOR”), SINGAPORE SWAP OFFER RATE (“SOR”) AND/OR THE BANK BILL SWAP REFERENCE RATE (“BBSW”) BY SUBMITTING RATES THAT WERE ARTIFICIALLY LOW OR HIGH. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THEY TRANSACTED IN LOANS, DERIVATIVES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, YEN LIBOR, SWISS FRANC LIBOR, EUROYEN TIBOR, EURIBOR, SIBOR, SOR OR BBSW AND ASSERT A VARIETY OF CLAIMS INCLUDING ANTITRUST CLAIMS SEEKING TREBLE DAMAGES. THESE MATTERS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF LITIGATION.

IN THE U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR-RELATED ACTIONS, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN CLAIMS, INCLUDING THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND PERMITTED OTHER CLAIMS UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND COMMON LAW TO PROCEED. IN MAY 2016, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT VACATED THE DISMISSAL OF THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO ASSERT ANTITRUST CLAIMS. IN JULY 2016, JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER DEFENDANTS AGAIN MOVED IN THE DISTRICT COURT TO DISMISS THE ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND IN DECEMBER 2016, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION, FINDING THAT CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS LACKED STANDING TO ASSERT ANTITRUST CLAIMS. SEPARATELY, IN OCTOBER 2016, JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FILED A PETITION TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT’S DECISION THAT VACATED

THE DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFFS’ ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THAT PETITION WAS DENIED.

THE FIRM IS

ONE

OF THE DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGING THAT DEFENDANT BANKS AND ICAP CONSPIRED TO MANIPULATE THE U.S. DOLLAR ISDAFIX RATES. PLAINTIFFS PRIMARILY ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER THE FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS AND COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT. IN APRIL 2016, THE FIRM SETTLED THE ISDAFIX LITIGATION, ALONG WITH CERTAIN OTHER BANKS. THOSE SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN PRELIMINARILY APPROVED BY THE COURT.

MADOFF LITIGATION.

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY BY INVESTORS WHO WERE NET WINNERS (I.E., MADOFF CUSTOMERS WHO HAD TAKEN MORE MONEY OUT OF THEIR ACCOUNTS THAN HAD BEEN INVESTED) IN MADOFF’S PONZI SCHEME AND WERE NOT INCLUDED IN A PRIOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT. THESE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW, AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL CLAIMS. A SIMILAR ACTION WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT STYLED AS A CLASS ACTION, AND INCLUDED CLAIMS PURSUANT TO FLORIDA STATUTES. THE FLORIDA COURT GRANTED THE FIRM’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE, AND IN AUGUST 2016, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. IN ADDITION, THE SAME PLAINTIFFS HAVE RE-FILED THEIR DISMISSED STATE CLAIMS IN FLORIDA STATE COURT, WHERE THE FIRM’S MOTION TO DISMISS IS PENDING. THE NEW JERSEY COURT GRANTED A TRANSFER MOTION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, WHICH GRANTED THE FIRM’S MOTION TO DISMISS, AND THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN APPEAL OF THAT DISMISSAL.

AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN SERVICING CHANGES BY JPMC, TO RESOLVE ALL REPURCHASE AND SERVICING CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSERTED OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO

330

IN JUNE 2015, THE COURT RULED IN

FAVOR OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE FIRM OR THE FDIC BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK’S REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, HOLDING THAT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ASSUMED ONLY THOSE LIABILITIES THAT WERE REFLECTED ON WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK’S FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING RECORDS AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, AND ONLY UP TO THE AMOUNT OF THE BOOK VALUE REFLECTED THEREIN. THE FDIC HAS APPEALED THAT RULING.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ALSO FILED COMPLAINTS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AGAINST THE FDIC, IN ITS CORPORATE CAPACITY AS WELL AS IN ITS CAPACITY AS RECEIVER FOR WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK, ASSERTING MULTIPLE CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE & ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

SINCE 2012, THE FRENCH CRIMINAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY SENIOR MANAGERS OF WENDEL INVESTISSEMENT (“WENDEL”) DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2004 THROUGH 2007 TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR SHAREHOLDINGS IN WENDEL. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., PARIS BRANCH PROVIDED FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTIONS TO A NUMBER OF MANAGERS OF WENDEL IN 2007. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS COOPERATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION. THE INVESTIGATING JUDGES ISSUED AN

ORDONNANCE DE RENVOI

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2016, REFERRING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. TO THE FRENCH

TRIBUNAL CORRECTIONNEL

THE FIRM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN LEGAL CHALLENGES MADE TO THE COURT OF CASSATION, FRANCE’S HIGHEST COURT, WHICH HAVE BEEN REFERRED BACK TO AND REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE PARIS COURT OF APPEAL. IN ADDITION, CIVIL PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN COMMENCED AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BY A NUMBER OF THE MANAGERS. THE CLAIMS ARE SEPARATE, INVOLVE DIFFERENT ALLEGATIONS AND ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PROCEEDINGS.

*     *     *

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IT INTENDS TO

266

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2016 ANNUAL REPORT

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN ALL SUCH MATTERS. ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED OF ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. GAAP FOR CONTINGENCIES, THE FIRM ACCRUES FOR A LITIGATION-RELATED LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS OUTSTANDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EACH QUARTER TO ASSESS ITS LITIGATION RESERVES, AND MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IN SUCH RESERVES, UPWARDS OR DOWNWARD, AS APPROPRIATE, BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S BEST JUDGMENT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL. DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, 2015 AND 2014, THE FIRM’S LEGAL EXPENSE WAS A BENEFIT OF

$(317) MILLION

AND AN EXPENSE OF

$3.0 BILLION

AND

$2.9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S LITIGATION RESERVES WILL NOT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE MATTERS PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOMES OF THE CURRENTLY PENDING MATTERS, THE TIMING OF THEIR ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OR THE EVENTUAL LOSSES, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FIRM NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES IT HAS CURRENTLY ACCRUED OR THAT A MATTER WILL NOT HAVE MATERIAL REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES. AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

CLTV RATIO;

(III) LOANS SECURED BY NON-OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES; OR (IV) A DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO ABOVE NORMAL LIMITS. A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF

THE FIRM’S

ALT-A LOANS ARE THOSE WHERE A BORROWER DOES NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF HIS OR HER ASSETS OR THE AMOUNT OR SOURCE OF HIS OR HER INCOME.

OPTION ARMS

THE OPTION ARM REAL ESTATE LOAN PRODUCT IS AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN THAT PROVIDES THE BORROWER WITH THE OPTION EACH MONTH TO MAKE A FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY OR MINIMUM PAYMENT. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON AN OPTION ARM LOAN IS BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE IS USUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED RATE. THE FULLY INDEXED RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN INDEX RATE PLUS A MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD ENDS, THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON THE LOAN INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE AND ADJUSTS MONTHLY TO REFLECT MOVEMENTS IN THE INDEX. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO COVER INTEREST ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR MONTH, AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IS DEFERRED AND ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN.

OPTION ARM LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT RECAST, WHICH CONVERTS THE LOAN TO A VARIABLE-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN UPON MEETING SPECIFIED LOAN BALANCE AND ANNIVERSARY DATE TRIGGERS.

PRIME

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ARE MADE TO BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT RECORDS WHO MEET SPECIFIC UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO INCOME AND OVERALL DEBT LEVELS. NEW PRIME MORTGAGE BORROWERS PROVIDE FULL DOCUMENTATION AND GENERALLY HAVE RELIABLE PAYMENT HISTORIES.

SUBPRIME

SUBPRIME LOANS ARE LOANS THAT, PRIOR TO MID-2008, WERE OFFERED TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WITH ONE OR MORE HIGH RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) UNRELIABLE OR POOR PAYMENT HISTORIES; (II) A HIGH LTV RATIO OF GREATER THAN 80% (WITHOUT BORROWER-PAID MORTGAGE INSURANCE); (III) A HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO; (IV) AN OCCUPANCY TYPE FOR THE LOAN IS OTHER THAN THE BORROWER’S PRIMARY RESIDENCE; OR (V) A HISTORY OF DELINQUENCIES OR LATE PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN.

.

BASEL III ESTABLISHES TWO COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING RWA (A STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND AN ADVANCED APPROACH) WHICH INCLUDE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, AND IN THE CASE OF BASEL III ADVANCED, ALSO OPERATIONAL RISK. KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE CALCULATION OF CREDIT RISK RWA BETWEEN THE STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES ARE THAT FOR BASEL III ADVANCED, CREDIT RISK RWA IS BASED ON RISK-SENSITIVE APPROACHES WHICH LARGELY RELY ON THE USE OF INTERNAL CREDIT MODELS AND PARAMETERS, WHEREAS FOR BASEL III STANDARDIZED, CREDIT RISK RWA IS GENERALLY BASED ON SUPERVISORY RISK-WEIGHTINGS WHICH VARY PRIMARILY BY COUNTERPARTY TYPE AND ASSET CLASS. MARKET RISK RWA IS CALCULATED ON A GENERALLY CONSISTENT BASIS BETWEEN BASEL III STANDARDIZED AND BASEL III ADVANCED, BOTH OF WHICH INCORPORATE THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN BASEL 2.5.

IMPACT OF NONACCRUAL LOANS AND ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS ON INTEREST INCOME

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM NONACCRUAL LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH NONACCRUAL LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS HAD THEY BEEN PERFORMING AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THIS DATA FOR THE YEARS SPECIFIED. THE CHANGE IN FORGONE INTEREST INCOME FROM

2014

THROUGH

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON THE FFIEC GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK.

THE REPORTING OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION, BY COUNTRY AND SECTOR, OF CLAIMS ON, AND LIABILITIES TO, FOREIGN RESIDENTS HELD BY U.S. BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND IS USED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF CREDIT AND RELATED RISKS,

INCLUDING TRANSFER AND COUNTRY RISK. COUNTRY LOCATION UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REPORTING IS BASED ON WHERE THE ENTITY OR COUNTERPARTY IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 108–109.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED 0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF THE DATES SPECIFIED.

WRITE-OFFS OF PCI LOANS ARE RECORDED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN ACTUAL LOSSES FOR A POOL EXCEED ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. A WRITE-OFF OF A PCI LOAN IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS REMOVED FROM A POOL (E.G., UPON LIQUIDATION). DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, THE FIRM RECORDED A $291 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO REDUCE THE PCI ALLOWANCE AND THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE FIRM’S PCI LOAN PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INTEREST FORGIVENESS MODIFICATIONS. THIS ADJUSTMENT HAD NO IMPACT TO THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.
