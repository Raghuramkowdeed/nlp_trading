ITEM 1: BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM) IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN CHASE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.), WITH $1.6 TRILLION IN ASSETS, $123 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH U.S.

BRANCHES IN 17 STATES, AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE BANK USA, N.A.), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRMS CREDIT CARDISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES INC. (JPMORGAN SECURITIES), ITS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND

SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON

FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY

PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS

(INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES, ASSET MANAGEMENT) AND CORPORATE (WHICH INCLUDES ITS PRIVATE EQUITY, TREASURY AND CORPORATE). A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A), BEGINNING ON PAGE 38,

AND IN NOTE 34 ON PAGE 175.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER

BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING

COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION AND PRICE. COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPETES GLOBALLY;

WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS UPON ITS

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.

CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, OR THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW,

INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED. JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA).

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD), IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT

THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO

PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE MET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND CRA REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER GLBA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA

REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED UPON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE REGULATED BY THE

OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). SEE OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRMS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE THAT ARE NATIONAL BANKS. NONBANK

SUBSIDIARIES OF THE FIRM ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A

RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET

INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS.

SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGES 165166 FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2008 AND 2007, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE FDIC)

HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A

DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFFBALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER

RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE

GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

THE

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (WHICH REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS FOR DISALLOWED GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE

ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK.

OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008, THE SEC AUTHORIZED JPMORGAN SECURITIES TO USE THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF COMPUTING NET CAPITAL FOR BROKER/DEALERS THAT ARE PART OF CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISED ENTITIES AS DEFINED BY SEC RULES. ACCORDINGLY, JPMORGAN SECURITIES MAY

CALCULATE DEDUCTIONS FOR MARKET RISK USING ITS INTERNAL MARKET RISK MODELS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGE 64 AND NOTE 28 ON PAGES 166167.

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS

PROPOSED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE BASEL II RULES WILL ALSO APPLY TO THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDIC-

TIONS. IN THE U.S., JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES BY EMPLOYING INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO DERIVE

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS U.S. BANK SUPERVISORS THAT ITS INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY STANDARDS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS

TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF

1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS; AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES. THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO

BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE; HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE

UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARYS CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE FDIC ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS, AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2005, BY WHICH THE FDIC ESTABLISHED A NEW BASE RATE SCHEDULE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF DEPOSIT

INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SET NEW ASSESSMENT RATES WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2007. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO A RISK CATEGORY BASED UPON CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES. DEPENDING UPON THE RISK CATEGORY

TO WHICH IT IS ASSIGNED, THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS THEN ASSESSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS BASED UPON ITS DEPOSITS. SOME DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE ENTITLED TO APPLY AGAINST THESE PREMIUMS A CREDIT THAT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE EFFECT TO PREMIUM PAYMENTS,

IF ANY, THAT THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY HAVE MADE IN CERTAIN PRIOR YEARS. THE NEW ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS EARNINGS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN

FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO

TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO

THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE

ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER

FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER

UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY

OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OR DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., OR CHASE BANK USA, N.A., SUCH PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT.

THE BANK

SECRECY ACT, WHICH WAS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001, REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS FOR NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS, OR PERSONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PRIVATE BANKING FOR NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE, SPECIFIC AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED

DUE DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND REPORT INSTANCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING THROUGH THOSE ACCOUNTS. THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF

FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

THE BANK

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGES 165166.

THE FIRMS BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE

CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS

UNDER

GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND

LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES THROUGH JPMORGAN SECURITIES AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC

AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, AND OTHER SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. JPMORGAN SECURITIES IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC. THE

FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. ONE SUBSIDIARY IS REGISTERED AS A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS, ALL

WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFTC). THESE CFTC-REGISTERED SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRMS ENERGY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

COMMISSION. THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE AND

ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING, ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION OF CONSUMER LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOANS.

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRMS POLICIES

AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO (1) THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS; AND (2) THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE

OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN GLBA.

PART I

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 101. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW,

IN THE MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER OF THE FIRMS REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM. THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF

THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL

ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES CAN AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO CAN AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A MARKET DOWNTURN CAN LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM

EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUE THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY REDUCES TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER TRADING REVENUE.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES, WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS OR LESS LIQUIDITY OR OTHER WEAKNESS IN THE MARKETS ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS THE FIRM MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS

OR INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS HELD BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE

AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, AND OTHER

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUE RELATING TO ITS TRADING WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS COULD NOT

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS MANAGED BY, OR HELD IN CUSTODY OF, THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS

OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES

THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN A POOR

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS

AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN

CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS. CERTAIN CHANGES TO THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN

ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR OTHER ABRUPT CHANGES IN MARKETS OR ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ANY OR ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN DECLINES

IN LIQUIDITY OR PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN FIRM BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO

DECLINES IN THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER

ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL

FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NONDEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET

SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRE

THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN

ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

THE FIRM HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED ENTITY; OR IMPROVED PRICE FOR THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT

CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASES

MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS OR THAT ANY BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND WILL RESULT IN ALL OF THE POSITIVE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ITS ACQUISITIONS, THE

FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN

FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A

LARGE NUMBER OF INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY

DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF A FIRM EMPLOYEE CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY

MANIPULATES THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES.

ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

FIRM.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE FIRM WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED THE FIRM COULD

SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF SUCH INFORMATION WERE ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER

BY FAULT OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION IS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE

FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER

DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR PHYSICAL ASSETS, OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL

CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES

WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM VARIOUS UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS,

EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH IT MAY DO SO IN THE

FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION AND A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL FRAMEWORK ARE

ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE

IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED FIRM

OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES.

THE EMERGENCE OF A WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY OR PANDEMIC ALSO COULD CREATE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL

DISRUPTION THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUE AND OPERATIONS OR IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD.

THUS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE FIRM WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ARISING FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL EVENTS.

DAMAGE

TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION FOR THE FIRM IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRM ATTRACTING AND

MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO ITS REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING

THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY ALSO RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRMS PROSPECTS.

THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF THE FIRM ACTS WHEN IT

HAS, OR IS THOUGHT TO HAVE, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE FIRM DOES NOT PROPERLY MANAGE AMONG ITS VARIOUS BUSINESSES

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

AND

ROLES THE FLOW OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION OF ITS CLIENTS, IT COULD SUFFER REPUTATIONAL HARM THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE

FIRM EXPANDS ITS ACTIVITIES AMONG ITS NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS, HOLDINGS AND CLIENTS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS

AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT CAN GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

CERTAIN REGULATORS WHICH SUPERVISE THE FIRM HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER IN REVIEWING THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND

APPROVING ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THESE POWERS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM ENGAGES OR INTENDS TO ENGAGE. PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRMS BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED

REGULATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY, OFTEN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FIRM RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM EXPANDS ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS ACTIVITIES WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASING RANGE OF NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE NEW

REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. FURTHER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT, OR THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE INTERPRETED OR

ENFORCED, WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS

OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN

JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE IT SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM. PARTICULARLY AS A

PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS

PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES ARE ITS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL

IS INTENSE. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES.

FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CURRENT AND

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE OR HAVE DIMINISHED DEMAND FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ITS RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM.

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK,

INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS

THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY OF THE FIRMS HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES

AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. IN THE PAST, SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR

UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES. THIS MAY OCCUR AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR MANAGED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES

BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

FINALLY, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE

FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS

COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. A COMPROMISE TO THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRM. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH OR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED) AND DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE

FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN OR UNANTICIPATED CONTRACTION OF THE CREDIT OR OTHER MARKET OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. FURTHER, IN A PERIOD OF DIFFICULT CREDIT OR OTHER MARKETS, THE FIRM MAY BE FORCED TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS

AT A HIGHER COST OR IT MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE AS MUCH FUNDING AS IT NEEDS TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO CURTAIL ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHILE INCURRING HIGHER COSTS FOR FUNDING.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ARE IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, DEPENDING

ON THE SEVERITY, COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS OR COLLATERAL POSTING, AND PERMIT TERMINATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A PARTY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS OF CERTAIN

SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE FIRM BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE

PROVIDE FUNDING.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND

SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL

RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE FIRM COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN A SITUATION IN WHICH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE FIRM COULD BE

AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS THAT DEAL WITH EACH OTHER ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE THE

FIRM HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, IT ROUTINELY EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL

AND HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY OVERALL. AS A RESULT, A DEFAULT BY, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS

COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, OR LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS MAY

EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

THE FIRM IS PARTY TO NUMEROUS DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OR DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN. IF THE FIRM IS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE

THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS.

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE A TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT THE FIRM MAY FIND THE

CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS AND IMPAIR ITS

ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE IT TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND LIABILITY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANK, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL,

FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS

AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES BUSINESS TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. THE FIRMS COMMODITIES BUSINESS ALSO FURTHER EXPOSES IT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES,

ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRM ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE ITS RISKS BUT ITS ACTIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS

EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAKES JUDGMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS OF ITS SPES. IF IT IS LATER DETERMINED THAT NON-CONSOLIDATED SPES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED, THIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, RELATED FUNDING, REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL RATIOS AND, IF THE SPES ASSETS INCLUDE UNREALIZED LOSSES, COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO RECOGNIZE THOSE LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS), PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED

DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER FIRM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

THE HEADQUARTERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY AT 270 PARK AVENUE, WHICH IS A 50-STORY OFFICE

BUILDING OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THIS LOCATION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. THE BUILDING IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A MAJOR RENOVATION IN FIVE STAGES. THE DESIGN SEEKS TO ATTAIN THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY RATING FOR

RENOVATIONS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN LEED GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEM. THE RENOVATION OF THE TOP 10 FLOORS OF THE BUILDING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008

WITH THE OTHER STAGES TO FOLLOW IN THE MULTI-YEAR PROGRAM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY PLANNING TO CONSTRUCT A NEW INVESTMENT BANK HEADQUARTERS BUILDING CONTAINING

APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE TO BE LOCATED AT A SITE IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER COMPLEX IN NEW YORK CITY. AS CURRENTLY PLANNED, THE BUILDING WILL HAVE UP TO EIGHT TRADING FLOORS OF APPROXIMATELY 55,000 SQUARE FEET EACH

AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2013. THE BUILDING DESIGN WILL STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY CERTIFICATION UNDER THE LEED PROGRAM. FINAL NEGOTIATIONS OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE CONTINUING WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY OF

NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY WHICH CONTROLS THE SITE.

IN TOTAL, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNED OR LEASED APPROXIMATELY 10.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE SPACE AND

RETAIL SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY IN 2007. JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OWN OR LEASE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN HOUSTON AND DALLAS, TEXAS (AN AGGREGATE 4.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET); CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (4.0

MILLION SQUARE FEET); COLUMBUS, OHIO (2.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET); PHOENIX, ARIZONA (1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET); JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY (1.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET); WILMINGTON, DELAWARE (1.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET); AND 3,152 RETAIL BRANCHES IN 17 STATES.

THE FIRM OCCUPIES APPROXIMATELY 57.6 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF SPACE IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY LEASES

APPROXIMATELY 2.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE AND OWNS A 360,000 SQUARE-FOOT OPERATIONS CENTER. JPMORGAN IS CURRENTLY PLANNING TO CONSTRUCT A NEW HEADQUARTERS BUILDING FOR ITS INVESTMENT BANK AT A SITE IT HAS SECURED IN THE CITY OF

LONDON. AS CURRENTLY PLANNED, THE BUILDING WILL CONTAIN APPROXIMATELY 1.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE AND WILL HAVE UP TO FIVE TRADING FLOORS OF APPROXIMATELY 69,000 SQUARE FEET EACH. COMPLETION IS EXPECTED IN 2012. THE BUILDING DESIGN WILL STRIVE

TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY RATING UNDER THE BRE

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHOD, BREEAM, WHICH IS THE

PREVAILING BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT RATING SYSTEM USED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE FIRM OCCUPIES APPROXIMATELY 3.3 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF SPACE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL FACILITIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA UNDER

VARIOUS TYPES OF OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD AGREEMENTS, AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION TOTAL SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOR CORPORATE

PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY DETERMINE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CERTAIN OF ITS PREMISES AND

FACILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR ITS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF ANY SUCH EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS. SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE

MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OCCUPANCY EXPENSE, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION ON PAGES 3334.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER

OF LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF ITS BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENRON CORP., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (ENRON). SEVERAL ACTIONS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE FIRM HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, INCLUDING ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY ENRONS

BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE FIRM HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LEAD CLASS ACTION LITIGATION BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PURCHASERS OF ENRON SECURITIES, CAPTIONED

NEWBY V. ENRON CORP.

, FOR $2.2 BILLION

(PRETAX). APPROVAL OF THE NEWBY SETTLEMENT AND THE ORDER OF FINAL JUDGMENT AND DISMISSAL AS TO THE JPMORGAN CHASE DEFENDANTS IS NOW FINAL. THE LAST STEP IN THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS APPROVAL OF A PLAN OF ALLOCATION OF THE SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS TO THE

SETTLEMENT CLASS, AND THE COURT IS SCHEDULED TO HEAR PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO APPROVE SUCH A PLAN OF ALLOCATION ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008.

THE

NEWBY

SETTLEMENT DOES NOT RESOLVE ENRON-RELATED ACTIONS FILED SEPARATELY BY PLAINTIFFS WHO OPTED OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION OR BY CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE ASSERTING CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY THAT ACTION. SOME OF THESE OTHER ACTIONS HAVE BEEN SETTLED

NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., JPMORGAN PARTNERS, BEACON GROUP, LLC AND THREE FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN ACTIONS FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (THE MDL LITIGATION). IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACTIONS, BANK ONE, BANK ONE, N.A., AND BANC ONE

CAPITAL MARKETS, INC., ALSO ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND BANK ONE, N.A., WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY THE UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TRUST (UAT), A TRUST CREATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS OF

HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHOLLY OWNED SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES, INCLUDING NPF VI AND NPF XII, WHICH PURCHASED DISCOUNTED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE PAID UNDER THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS. NPF VI AND NPF XII FINANCED THE PURCHASES OF SUCH

RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF NOTES (NOTES) TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PLEDGED THE RECEIVABLES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REPAYMENT OF THE NOTES. IN THE MDL LITIGATION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS SUED IN

THE TRUSTEES VIOLATED FIDUCIARY AND CONTRACTUAL DUTIES, IMPROPERLY PERMITTED NCFE AND ITS AFFILIATES TO VIOLATE THE APPLICABLE INDENTURES AND VIOLATED SECURITIES LAWS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE NCFE

ARRANGEMENTS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES CONTROLLED THE BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE NCFE ENTITIES; WERE FULLY AWARE, OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT KNOWING, OF NCFES ALLEGED MANIPULATION OF ITS BOOKS; AND ARE LIABLE FOR

FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR PURPORTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE ALLEGED FRAUD TO THE PLAINTIFFS. PLAINTIFFS ALSO ALLEGE THAT BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC., IS LIABLE FOR COOPERATING IN THE SALE OF SECURITIES BASED UPON FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS. MOTIONS

A CORRECTED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT ON JUNE 23, 2006. PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS ARE BASED UPON ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ERISA ARISING FROM THE CONVERSION TO AND USE OF A CASH BALANCE FORMULA UNDER THE PLANS TO CALCULATE

PARTICIPANTS PENSION BENEFITS. SPECIFICALLY, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT: (1) THE CONVERSION TO AND USE OF A CASH BALANCE FORMULA UNDER THE PLANS VIOLATED ERISAS PROSCRIPTION AGAINST AGE DISCRIMINATION (THE AGE DISCRIMINATION

CLAIM); (2) THE CONVERSION TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA VIOLATED ERISAS PROSCRIPTIONS AGAINST THE BACKLOADING OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CREATED AN IMPERMISSIBLE FORFEITURE OF ACCRUED BENEFITS (THE BACKLOADING AND FORFEITURE

CLAIMS); AND (3) DEFENDANTS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY COMMUNICATE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS THE CONVERSION TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA AND IN GENERAL THE NATURE OF THE PLAN (THE NOTICE CLAIMS). IN OCTOBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DENIED THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE AGE DISCRIMINATION AND NOTICE CLAIMS, BUT GRANTED THE FIRMS MOTION TO DISMISS THE BACKLOADING AND FORFEITURE CLAIMS.

ON MAY 30, 2007, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK CERTIFIED A CLASS IN THIS ACTION. THE CLASS INCLUDES CURRENT PARTICIPANTS IN THE

IN RE JPMORGAN CHASE CASH BALANCE LITIGATION.

ON NOVEMBER 16, 2007, THE FIRM

ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT VISA, MASTERCARD, CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AND JPMORGAN CHASE, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER BANKS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES,

CONSPIRED TO SET THE PRICE OF INTERCHANGE IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ACT. THE COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES TYING/BUNDLING AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING. SINCE THE FILING OF THE CONNECTICUT COMPLAINT, OTHER COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED IN

DIFFERENT UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS CHALLENGING THE SETTING OF INTERCHANGE, AS WELL THE ASSOCIATIONS RESPECTIVE RULES. ALL CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON APRIL 24, 2006. DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS THAT PREDATE JANUARY 1, 2004. ON JANUARY 8, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO DISMISS THESE CLAIMS.

PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT CHALLENGING MASTERCARDS 2006 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, ALLEGING THAT THE OFFERING VIOLATES THE SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT AND

GIC INVESTIGATION.

THE NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICES ANTITRUST DIVISION AND THE PHILADELPHIA REGIONAL OFFICE OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING PARALLEL INVESTIGATIONS OF

POSSIBLE ANTITRUST AND SECURITIES VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BIDDING OR SALE OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND DERIVATIVES TO MUNICIPAL ISSUERS. THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS TO DATE HAS BEEN THE PERIOD 2001 TO 2005. THE FIRM

IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS PRODUCED DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS, INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS

MAY BE INITIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL

THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR

WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS

PART I

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS

AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL, ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS,

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME

OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE

REPORTED RECORD NET INCOME AND RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE IN 2007, EXCEEDING THE RECORD LEVELS ACHIEVED IN 2006. NET INCOME IN 2007 WAS $15.4 BILLION, OR $4.38 PER SHARE, AND TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $71.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $14.4

BILLION, OR $4.04 PER SHARE, AND TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $62.0 BILLION FOR 2006. THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 13% IN BOTH YEARS. REPORTED RESULTS IN 2006 INCLUDED $795 MILLION OF INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE EXCHANGE OF

SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES FOR THE CONSUMER, BUSINESS BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING BUSINESSES OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2006 WAS $13.6 BILLION, OR $3.82 PER SHARE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SEE PAGES 3135 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS RESULTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BENEFITED FROM

GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, FROM THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS FOCUS ON DRIVING ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS BY INVESTING IN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, REDUCING WASTE, EFFICIENTLY USING THE FIRMS

BALANCE SHEET AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE INTEGRATION PLAN FOR THE MERGER OF BANK ONE CORPORATION WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE ON JULY 1, 2004 (THE MERGER). THE SUCCESS IN EXECUTING ON THIS AGENDA IN 2007 IS REFLECTED IN THE

STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH EXPERIENCED BY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDING: RECORD LEVELS OF ADVISORY FEES, EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE; DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH IN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, TREASURY & SECURITIES

SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT; AND IMPROVED OPERATING MARGINS IN MOST BUSINESSES. THIS IMPROVED PERFORMANCE WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN KEY BUSINESS METRICS INCLUDING: DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES; 127 NEW BRANCHES AND 680 ADDITIONAL

ATMS; 15% GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY; $115 BILLION OF NET ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT INFLOWS; 16 MILLION NEW CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS WITH 1.4 MILLION SOLD IN BRANCHES; AND NEARLY DOUBLING REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION MARKET SHARE TO 11%

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007. AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRM INCREASED LOAN LOSS RESERVE LEVELS, AND MAINTAINED STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS AND AMPLE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AS PART OF ITS COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET.

DURING 2007, THE FIRM ALSO CONTINUED TO CREATE A STRONGER INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FIRM SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE IN-SOURCING OF ITS CREDIT CARD PROCESSING PLATFORM, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR FASTER INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WITH THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE SYSTEMS CONVERSION AND REBRANDING FOR 339 FORMER BANK OF NEW YORK BRANCHES AND THE CONVERSION OF THE WHOLESALE DEPOSIT SYSTEM (THE LAST SIGNIFICANT MERGER EVENT WHICH AFFECTED MORE THAN

$180 BILLION IN CUSTOMER BALANCES), THE FIRMS CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. NOW HAVE ACCESS TO OVER 3,100 BRANCHES AND 9,100 ATMS IN 17 STATES, ALL OF WHICH ARE ON COMMON COMPUTER SYSTEMS. WITH MERGER INTEGRATION

ACTIVITY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2007, THE FIRM FULLY REALIZED ITS ESTABLISHED MERGER-RELATED EXPENSE SAVINGS TARGET OF $3.0 BILLION. TO ACHIEVE THESE MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS, THE FIRM EXPENSED MERGER COSTS OF $209 MILLION DURING 2007, BRINGING THE

TOTAL CUMULATIVE AMOUNT EXPENSED SINCE THE MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT TO APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION (INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND CAPITALIZED COSTS). WITH THE COMPLETION OF ALL MERGER INTEGRATION ACTIVITY, NO FURTHER

MERGER COSTS WILL BE INCURRED.

IN 2007, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND INFLATION REMAINED WELL-CONTAINED DESPITE ONGOING PRICE PRESSURES ON ENERGY AND

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. DEVELOPING ECONOMIES MAINTAINED STRONG MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, BUT THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES SLOWED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR IN RESPONSE TO WEAK HOUSING CONDITIONS, MONETARY TIGHTENING BY SEVERAL CENTRAL BANKS,

RISING PETROLEUM PRICES AND TIGHTENING CREDIT CONDITIONS. THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN AVERAGE HOME PRICES WITH SOME SPECIFIC MARKETS DECLINING BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGES. DESPITE THE SLOWDOWN IN

THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES, LABOR MARKETS REMAINED RELATIVELY HEALTHY, SUPPORTING ONGOING SOLID, THOUGH SLOWING CONSUMER SPENDING. SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL LOSSES RELATED TO U.S. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS TRIGGERED A FLIGHT TO QUALITY IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS LATE IN THE SUMMER. IN ADDITION, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRESSURES IN INTERBANK FUNDING MARKETS INCREASED, CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY AND CREDIT WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR SOME LESS CREDITWORTHY WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

BORROWERS. CENTRAL BANKS TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO COUNTER PRESSURES IN FUNDING MARKETS, INCLUDING REDUCING INTEREST RATES AND SUSPENDING FURTHER TIGHTENING ACTIONS. CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2007, BUT

DECLINED OVER THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AMID DIFFICULT MORTGAGE AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS. DESPITE THE VOLATILITY IN CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS PERFORMANCE WAS STRONG, WITH THE U.S. STOCK MARKET REACHING AN

ALL-TIME RECORD IN OCTOBER; HOWEVER, THE STOCK MARKET PULLED BACK FROM THE RECORD LEVEL BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE S&P 500 AND INTERNATIONAL INDICES WERE UP, ON AVERAGE, APPROXIMATELY 8% DURING 2007.

THE FIRMS IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN 2007 BENEFITED BOTH FROM THE INVESTMENTS MADE IN EACH BUSINESS AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE CONTINUED OVERALL EXPANSION

OF THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES, OVERALL INCREASED LEVEL OF CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY AND POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS HELPED TO DRIVE NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND ORGANIC GROWTH WITHIN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. THESE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BENEFITS

WERE TEMPERED BY THE CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND THE CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET. THE INVESTMENT BANKS LOWER RESULTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAIN AND EXTREMELY VOLATILE

CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT MARKDOWNS ON LEVERAGED LENDING, SUBPRIME POSITIONS AND SECURITIZED PRODUCTS. RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND

HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE HOME EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIOS RELATED TO THE WEAK HOUSING MARKET. CARD SERVICES EARNINGS ALSO DECREASED DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET

CHARGE-OFFS. THE OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS EACH POSTED IMPROVED RESULTS VERSUS 2006. ASSET MANAGEMENT, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND COMMERCIAL BANKING REPORTED RECORD REVENUE AND EARNINGS IN 2007, AND PRIVATE EQUITY POSTED VERY STRONG

RESULTS.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, AND DISCUSSES RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS

UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES 3637 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INVESTMENT BANK

NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER TOTAL NET REVENUE AND A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE DECLINE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS

DRIVEN BY LOWER FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE DUE TO MARKDOWNS ON SUBPRIME POSITIONS, INCLUDING SUBPRIME COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS); MARKDOWNS ON LEVERAGE LENDING FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS; MARKDOWNS IN SECURITIZED

PRODUCTS ON NONSUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND WEAK CREDIT TRADING PERFORMANCE. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECLINE IN REVENUE WERE STRONG INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, DRIVEN BY RECORD ADVISORY AND RECORD EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES; RECORD EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE,

WHICH BENEFITED FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY AND RECORD TRADING RESULTS; AND RECORD REVENUE IN CURRENCIES AND STRONG REVENUE IN RATES. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ROSE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PRIMARILY RESULTING

FROM PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

NET INCOME DECLINED

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER NET MORTGAGE

SERVICING REVENUE; HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES; THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR LOSSES RELATED TO MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE; WIDER SPREADS ON LOANS; AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. REVENUE ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS EXPENSE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159. THE INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO

HOME EQUITY LOANS AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, AS WEAK HOUSING PRICES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR BOTH CATEGORIES OF LOANS. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION, THE

CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS EXPENSE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159 (FAIR VALUE OPTION), INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HIGHER MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

CARD SERVICES

NET INCOME DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE

TO AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TOTAL NET MANAGED REVENUE GROWTH AND A REDUCTION IN TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. THE GROWTH IN TOTAL NET MANAGED REVENUE REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF FEES, GROWTH IN AVERAGE LOAN

BALANCES AND INCREASED NET INTERCHANGE INCOME. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS, THE DISCONTINUATION OF CERTAIN BILLING PRACTICES (INCLUDING THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN OVER-LIMIT FEES AND THE TWO-CYCLE BILLING METHOD FOR

CALCULATING FINANCE CHARGES) AND THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS (THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM THE

CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005) AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DRIVEN BY HIGHER ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE PORTFOLIO. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECLINED FROM 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

MARKETING EXPENSE AND LOWER FRAUD-RELATED EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSE.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

POSTED RECORD NET INCOME AS RECORD

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. TOTAL NET REVENUE REFLECTED GROWTH IN LIABILITY BALANCES AND LOANS, INCREASED DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY A CONTINUED SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND SPREAD COMPRESSION IN THE LOAN AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, INCLUDING SLIGHTLY LOWER

CREDIT QUALITY, AS WELL AS GROWTH IN LOAN BALANCES. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED SLIGHTLY, AS LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSE RELATED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES

GENERATED RECORD NET INCOME DRIVEN BY RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. TOTAL NET

REVENUE BENEFITED FROM INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS, MARKET APPRECIATION, WIDER SPREADS IN SECURITIES LENDING, GROWTH IN ELECTRONIC VOLUMES AND HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY SPREAD

COMPRESSION AND A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO BUSINESS AND VOLUME GROWTH, AS WELL AS INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT PLATFORMS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

PRODUCED RECORD NET INCOME, WHICH BENEFITED FROM RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE. TOTAL NET REVENUE GREW AS A

RESULT OF INCREASED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES, AND HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS UP, LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND INVESTMENTS IN ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

CORPORATE

NET INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED TOTAL NET REVENUE. TOTAL NET REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF GAINS AND THE CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION OF CARRIED INTEREST TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE. REVENUE ALSO BENEFITED FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITY GAINS AND

AN IMPROVED NET INTEREST SPREAD. TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET LITIGATION EXPENSE DRIVEN BY CREDIT CARD-RELATED LITIGATION AND HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $795 MILLION IN 2006, WHICH INCLUDED A ONE-TIME GAIN OF $622 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES. DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS (INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT RESULTS) INCLUDED THE INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY OF SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES SOLD TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK IN OCTOBER 2006.

THE FIRMS MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $9.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $5.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING INCREASES IN BOTH THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PROVISIONS. THE TOTAL CONSUMER MANAGED PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES WAS $8.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE HIGHER PROVISION PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES LARGELY RELATED TO HOME EQUITY, CREDIT CARD AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND HIGHER

NET CHARGE-OFFS. CONSUMER MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $6.8 BILLION IN 2007, COMPARED WITH $5.3 BILLION IN 2006, RESULTING IN MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATES OF 1.97% AND 1.60%, RESPECTIVELY. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $934 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $321 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A HIGHER ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

WHOLESALE NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $72 MILLION IN 2007 (NET CHARGE-OFF RATE OF 0.04%), COMPARED WITH NET RECOVERIES OF $22 MILLION IN 2006 (NET RECOVERY RATE OF 0.01%). IN TOTAL, THE FIRM INCREASED ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2007 BY $2.3

BILLION, BRINGING THE BALANCE OF THE ALLOWANCE TO $10.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE FIRM HAD, AT YEAR END, TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $123.2

BILLION AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.4%. THE FIRM PURCHASED $8.2 BILLION, OR 168 MILLION SHARES, OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING THE YEAR.

2008 BUSINESS

OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2008 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S. ECONOMIES (WHICH CURRENTLY ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE), FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY

(INCLUDING INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS), THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS. EACH OF THESE LINKED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES

A LOWER LEVEL OF GROWTH GLOBALLY AND IN THE U.S. DURING 2008 AND INCREASED CREDIT COSTS IN ALL BUSINESSES. THE SLOWER THE GROWTH IS, OR THE WEAKER THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE, COMPARED WITH CURRENT FORECASTS, THE MORE THE FIRMS FINANCIAL

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES COULD INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF LOSSES IN RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES $94.8 BILLION HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIO AND GROWTH AND INCREASED LOSSES IN THE $15.5 BILLION RETAINED SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL STRESS ON THE CONSUMER FROM CONTINUED DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOUSING

PRICES AND THE ELEVATED INVENTORY OF UNSOLD HOUSES NATIONALLY, MANAGEMENT REMAINS EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WITH RESPECT TO THE HOME EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS. ECONOMIC DATA

RELEASED IN EARLY 2008, INCLUDING

CONTINUED DECLINES IN HOUSING PRICES AND INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT, INDICATE THAT LOSSES WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO RISE IN THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER PROVISION COULD INCREASE DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS IN CARD

SERVICES. BASED ON MANAGEMENTS CURRENT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, HOME EQUITY LOSSES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS COULD POTENTIALLY DOUBLE FROM THIS LEVEL BY THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, AND THE

NET CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR CARD SERVICES COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY 4.50% OF MANAGED LOANS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008 AND TO APPROXIMATELY 5.00% BY THE END OF 2008. NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR HOME EQUITY AND CARD SERVICES COULD BE HIGHER THAN

MANAGEMENTS CURRENT EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON SUCH FACTORS AS CHANGES IN HOUSING PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES MAY ALSO INCREASE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF LOAN GROWTH, PORTFOLIO

ACTIVITY AND CHANGES IN UNDERLYING CREDIT CONDITIONS.

THE INVESTMENT BANK ENTERS 2008 WITH THE CAPITAL MARKETS STILL BEING AFFECTED BY THE DISRUPTION IN THE CREDIT

AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, AS WELL AS BY OVERALL LOWER LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND WIDER CREDIT SPREADS, ALL OF WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO REDUCED LEVELS OF CLIENT ACTIVITY, DIFFICULTY IN SYNDICATING LEVERAGED LOANS, LOWER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND

LOWER TRADING REVENUE. WHILE SOME LEVERAGED FINANCE LOANS WERE SOLD DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THE FIRM HELD $26.4 BILLION OF LEVERAGED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS AS HELD-FOR-SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. MARKDOWNS IN EXCESS OF 6%

HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON THE LEVERAGED LENDING POSITIONS AS OF YEAR-END 2007. THESE POSITIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO HEDGE EFFECTIVELY AND AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL BE FURTHER

MARKDOWNS ON THIS ASSET CLASS. IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM DECIDED, BASED ON ITS VIEW OF POTENTIAL RELATIVE RETURNS, TO RETAIN FOR INVESTMENT $4.9 BILLION OF THE LEVERAGED LENDING PORTFOLIO THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY HELD-FOR-SALE. THE INVESTMENT BANK

ALSO HELD, AT YEAR END, AN AGGREGATE $2.7 BILLION OF SUBPRIME CDOS AND OTHER SUBPRIME-RELATED EXPOSURES WHICH COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS DURING 2008. WHILE THESE POSITIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGED (NONE OF THE HEDGES

INCLUDE INSURANCE FROM MONOLINE INSURANCE COMPANIES), THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON THESE POSITIONS, AS THESE MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID AND FURTHER WRITEDOWNS MAY BE NECESSARY. OTHER EXPOSURES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 THAT HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK GIVEN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE CDO WAREHOUSE AND TRADING POSITIONS OF $5.5 BILLION (OVER 90% CORPORATE LOANS AND BONDS); COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS)

EXPOSURE OF $15.5 BILLION; AND $6.4 BILLION OF ALT-A MORTGAGE POSITIONS.

A WEAKER ECONOMY AND LOWER EQUITY MARKETS IN 2008 WOULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT BUSINESS

VOLUMES, ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE NET LOSS IN TREASURY AND OTHER CORPORATE ON A COMBINED BASIS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY

$50 MILLION TO $100 MILLION PER QUARTER OVER TIME. PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS, WHICH ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE CAPITAL MARKETS, COULD CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN 2008 THAN IN 2007. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MINIMAL.

TOTAL NET

REVENUE OF $71.4 BILLION WAS UP $9.4 BILLION, OR 15%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME, VERY STRONG PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, RECORD ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE, HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME AND

RECORD INVESTMENT BANKING FEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE REVENUE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER TRADING REVENUE.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES GREW IN

2007 TO A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS RECORD SET IN 2006. RECORD ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES DROVE THE RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY

RECORDED IN IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4042 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE CONSISTS OF TRADING REVENUE AND PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS. TRADING REVENUE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE 2006 LEVEL, PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKDOWNS IN IB OF $1.4 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) ON SUBPRIME POSITIONS, INCLUDING SUBPRIME CDOS, AND $1.3 BILLION (NET OF FEES) ON LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED LOANS AND

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. ALSO IN IB, MARKDOWNS IN SECURITIZED PRODUCTS ON NONSUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND WEAK CREDIT TRADING PERFORMANCE MORE THAN OFFSET RECORD REVENUE IN CURRENCIES AND STRONG REVENUE IN BOTH RATES AND EQUITIES. EQUITIES BENEFITED FROM

STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY AND RECORD TRADING RESULTS ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS. IBS CREDIT PORTFOLIO RESULTS INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUE FROM RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN PRIVATE

EQUITY GAINS FROM 2006 REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF GAINS, THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY CARRIED INTEREST AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND A

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 ON NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 (FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE THE IB AND

CORPORATE SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4042 AND 5960, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES

ROSE FROM THE 2006 LEVEL, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB, SEE THE RFS SEGMENT

RESULTS ON PAGES 4348, THE TSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5455, AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5253 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSET MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE REACHED A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS RECORD SET IN 2006. INCREASED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES IN AM DROVE THE RECORD RESULTS. THE 18% GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

FROM YEAR-END 2006 CAME FROM NET ASSET INFLOWS AND MARKET APPRECIATION ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS: INSTITUTIONAL, RETAIL, PRIVATE BANK AND PRIVATE CLIENT SERVICES. TSS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS

REVENUE, DRIVEN BY INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS AND MARKET APPRECIATION ON ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY. FINALLY, COMMISSIONS REVENUE INCREASED, DUE MAINLY TO HIGHER BROKERAGE TRANSACTION VOLUME (PRIMARILY INCLUDED WITHIN FIXED INCOME

AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE OF IB), WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS BY RFS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 AND A CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RESULTING FROM ACCELERATED SURRENDERS OF CUSTOMER ANNUITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON PAGES 4042, RFS ON PAGES 4348, TSS ON PAGES 5455, AND AM ON PAGES 5658, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FAVORABLE VARIANCE RESULTING FROM SECURITIES GAINS IN 2007 COMPARED WITH SECURITIES LOSSES IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RESULTS OF REPOSITIONING OF THE

TREASURY INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE POSITIVE VARIANCE WAS A $234 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES), WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN THE FIRMS

TREASURY BUSINESS, SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 5960 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) ASSET VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS AND GROWTH IN THIRD-PARTY MORTGAGE LOANS

SERVICED DROVE AN INCREASE IN NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE. PRODUCTION REVENUE ALSO GREW, AS AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS EXPENSE (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED

AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159) MORE THAN OFFSET MARKDOWNS ON THE MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE AND PIPELINE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS

RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS, SEE THE MORTGAGE BANKING DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4647 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME

REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE 2006 LEVEL, AS LOWER SERVICING FEES EARNED IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WERE AFFECTED UNFAVORABLY BY HIGHER NET CREDIT LOSSES AND NARROWER LOAN MARGINS, WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NET

INTERCHANGE INCOME EARNED ON THE FIRMS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE CSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4951 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN SALES AND WORKOUTS, AND THE ABSENCE OF A $103 MILLION GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 RELATED TO THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES IN ITS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. (THE 2007 GAIN ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES WAS RECORDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) AS THE SHARES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) PORTFOLIO SUBSEQUENT TO THE IPO.) INCREASED INCOME FROM

AUTOMOBILE OPERATING LEASES AND HIGHER GAINS ON THE SALE OF LEVERAGED LEASES AND EDUCATION LOANS PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINE.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING: HIGHER TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME, DUE TO A SHIFT OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE (RELATED TO CERTAIN IB STRUCTURED NOTES TO WHICH FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING WAS ELECTED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159); GROWTH IN LIABILITY AND DEPOSIT BALANCES IN THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES; A HIGHER LEVEL OF CREDIT CARD LOANS; THE IMPACT OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION; AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN TREASURYS

NET INTEREST SPREAD. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD DEPOSIT AND LIABILITY PRODUCTS. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS FOR 2007 WERE $1.1 TRILLION, UP 12% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ASSETS  DEBT INSTRUMENTS, LOANS, AND AFS SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING AND DECONSOLIDATION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006

OF CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THAT THE FIRM ADMINISTERED. THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.39%, AN INCREASE OF 23 BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE IN PART TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2006 WAS $62.0 BILLION, UP $7.8 BILLION,

OR 14%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, PRIMARILY FROM STRONG TRADING RESULTS, HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSION REVENUE AND GROWTH IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME AND LOWER SECURITIES PORTFOLIO LOSSES. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A DECLINE IN OTHER INCOME PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE GAIN RECOGNIZED IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO, THE

ON-LINE DEEP DISCOUNT BROKERAGE BUSINESS, AND LOWER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN DEBT AND

EQUITY UNDERWRITING, AS WELL AS ADVISORY FEES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4042 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

REVENUE FROM PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS ACTIVITIES INCREASED COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTLY DRIVEN BY STRONG TRADING REVENUE RESULTS DUE TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN IB EQUITY AND

FIXED INCOME MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, SEE THE IB AND CORPORATE SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4042 AND 5960, RESPECTIVELY, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGE 122 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES ROSE SLIGHTLY IN COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER FEE INCOME ON DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES

AND, IN PART, FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY RECORDED IN RFS, TSS AND CB, SEE THE RFS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4348, THE TSS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

5455, AND THE CB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 5253 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE IN 2006

WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN AM, WHICH EXCEEDED $1 TRILLION AT THE END OF 2006, HIGHER EQUITY-RELATED COMMISSIONS IN IB AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. THE GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REFLECTED NEW ASSET

INFLOWS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL SEGMENTS. TSS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE, DRIVEN BY INCREASED PRODUCT USAGE BY NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS AND MARKET APPRECIATION ON ASSETS UNDER

CUSTODY. IN ADDITION, COMMISSIONS IN THE IB ROSE AS A RESULT OF STRENGTH ACROSS REGIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND BROWNCO. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON

PAGES 4042, RFS ON PAGES 4348, TSS ON PAGES 5455, AND AM ON PAGES 5658, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FAVORABLE VARIANCE IN SECURITIES GAINS

(LOSSES) WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SECURITIES LOSSES IN TREASURY IN 2006 FROM PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 5960 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME DECLINED IN COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN NET

MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE AND HIGHER LOSSES ON MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE. THESE DECLINES WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY GROWTH IN PRODUCTION REVENUE AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER VOLUME OF LOAN SALES AND WIDER GAIN ON SALE MARGINS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS, SEE THE MORTGAGE BANKING DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4647 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME THAT FAVORABLY AFFECTED INTERCHANGE INCOME AND SERVICING FEES EARNED IN CONNECTION

WITH SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH BENEFITED FROM LOWER CREDIT LOSSES INCURRED ON SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD LOANS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY INCREASES IN VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARD PROGRAMS, AND

INTEREST PAID TO INVESTORS IN SECURITIZED LOANS. CREDIT CARD INCOME ALSO WAS AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO A $1.3 BILLION PRETAX GAIN RECOGNIZED IN 2005 ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO AND LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE TWO ITEMS WERE HIGHER AUTOMOBILE

OPERATING LEASE REVENUE; AN INCREASE IN EQUITY INVESTMENT INCOME, IN PARTICULAR, FROM CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC; AND A PRETAX GAIN OF $103 MILLION ON THE SALE OF MASTERCARD SHARES IN ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE LARGELY TO IMPROVEMENT IN TREASURYS NET INTEREST SPREAD AND INCREASES IN WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES, WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER LOANS, AFS SECURITIES AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS. INCREASES IN CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS AND DEPOSITS INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON BOTH TRADING-RELATED

ASSETS AND LOANS, A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD DEPOSITS PRODUCTS, RFSS SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO IN AM. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS IN 2006 WERE $995.5 BILLION, UP 11% FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN LOANS AND OTHER LIQUID EARNING ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING AND DECONSOLIDATION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 OF

CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THAT THE FIRM ADMINISTERED. THE NET YIELD ON INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.16%, A DECREASE OF FOUR BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2007 ROSE $3.6 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PROVISIONS. THE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS LARGELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES

RELATED TO HOME EQUITY, CREDIT CARD AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS. CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2006 BENEFITED FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DUE TO PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND PORTFOLIO GROWTH. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR RFS ON PAGES 4348, CS ON PAGES 4951, IB ON PAGES 4042, CB ON PAGES 5253 AND CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7389 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2006 DECLINED $213 MILLION

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A $1.3 BILLION DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE DECREASE IN THE CONSUMER PROVISION WAS DRIVEN BY CS,

REFLECTING LOWER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED LOSSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CONTRACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE 2005 CONSUMER PROVISION ALSO REFLECTED A $350 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, A PORTION OF WHICH WAS RELEASED IN 2006. THE

INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NONPERFORMING LOANS. THE BENEFIT IN 2005 WAS DUE TO STRONG CREDIT QUALITY, REFLECTED IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE AND

NONPERFORMING LOANS. CREDIT QUALITY IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WAS STABLE.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2007 WAS $41.7

BILLION, UP $2.9 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM 2006 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION; THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN

PRIVATE EQUITY CARRIED INTEREST FROM PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE; THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007

DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159); AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES AND CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FROM 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES; IN PARTICULAR, THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED COMPARED WITH 2006, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES IN THE

AUTO FINANCE BUSINESS IN RFS AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH. CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER BROKERAGE EXPENSE AND CREDIT CARD PROCESSING COSTS RESULTING FROM GROWTH IN TRANSACTION VOLUME. INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES AND ACQUISITIONS

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED EXPENSE.

MARKETING EXPENSE DECLINED COMPARED WITH 2006 DUE LARGELY TO LOWER CREDIT CARD MARKETING EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE FROM THE 2006 LEVEL WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED NET LEGAL-RELATED COSTS REFLECTING A LOWER LEVEL OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND HIGHER EXPENSE, WHICH

INCLUDED THE COST OF CREDIT CARD-RELATED LITIGATION. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE BUSINESS GROWTH AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006,

LOWER CREDIT CARD FRAUD-RELATED LOSSES AND CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 18 AND

NOTE 11 ON PAGES 154157 AND 134, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2006 WAS $38.8 BILLION, DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO MATERIAL LITIGATION-RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $512 MILLION IN

2006 COMPARED WITH A NET CHARGE OF $2.6 BILLION (INCLUDES $208 MILLION OF MATERIAL LITIGATION-RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES) IN 2005, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (ENRON) AND WORLDCOM

CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. ALSO CON-

TRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER MERGER COSTS, THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH, THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, AND MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET MOSTLY BY HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND INCREMENTAL EXPENSE OF $712 MILLION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, AND HIGHER MARKETING

EXPENDITURES.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO

SFAS 123R OF $712 MILLION FOR 2006, AND ADDITIONAL HEAD-COUNT IN CONNECTION WITH GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME, ACQUISITIONS, AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER EXPENSE

EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R AND EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES, SEE NOTE 10 ON PAGES 131133 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DUE TO ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, WHICH INCLUDED THE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK BRANCHES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE FOR 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND CONTINUING BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES, LOWER LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL

LEGAL MATTERS SETTLED IN 2005 AND THE PAYMENTECH DECONSOLIDATION. THE DECREASE WAS OFFSET PARTLY BY ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES.

MARKETING EXPENSE

WAS HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE COSTS OF CREDIT CARD CAMPAIGNS.

OTHER EXPENSE WAS LOWER DUE TO SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGES OF $2.8

BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON AND WORLDCOM CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $512 MILLION AND $208 MILLION, IN

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, PERTAINING TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LITIGATION MATTERS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LITIGATION, REFER TO NOTE 29 ON PAGES 167168 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WERE CHARGES OF

$93 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF A CLIENT CONTRACT IN TSS IN 2005; AND IN RFS, THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER LITIGATION, AND THE

IMPACT OF GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME, ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES 104107 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED

BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS AND THE LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS ON A

MANAGED BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUME CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY CS REMAIN ON

THE BALANCE SHEET AND PRESENTS

REVENUE ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS OR BY THE FIRM AS A

WHOLE.

THE PRESENTATION OF CS RESULTS ON A MANAGED BASIS ASSUMES THAT CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED AND SOLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 140 STILL REMAIN

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THAT THE EARNINGS ON THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE EARNINGS ON RETAINED LOANS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED BASIS TO

EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED AND DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL, BASED UPON MANAGED FINANCIAL

INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE SAME UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

THE FOLLOWING

SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRMS REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

AND

ONGOING RISK MONITORING ARE USED FOR BOTH LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND SECURITIZED LOANS. ALTHOUGH SECURITIZATIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS THE ONGOING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS,

AS THE CUSTOMERS MAY CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS; ACCORDINGLY, THE CUSTOMERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE SECURITIZED LOANS AND THE LOANS RETAINED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES MANAGED BASIS

INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS, ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOANS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE FIRMS RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED

TO MANAGED BASIS RESULTS FOR CS, SEE CS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 4951 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS, AND LOANS AND RESIDUAL INTERESTS SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON AN FTE BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX

CREDITS IS PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE

CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND THEREFORE FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE-OF-BUSINESS BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE

MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS.

THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGIES USED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING

AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO

ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO TREASURY WITHIN THE CORPORATE BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE

RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF

THAT SEGMENTS STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY THE FIRMS ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO). BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, THAT WOULD BE

EXPECTED IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF A SIMILAR PEER BUSINESS.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM REFINED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS THE 2005 PERIOD WAS NOT REVISED TO REFLECT THE NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS, CERTAIN BUSINESS METRICS, SUCH AS ROE, ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO

THE PRESENTATIONS IN 2007 AND 2006. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS CHANGE, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENTLINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGE 63 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON THEIR ACTUAL COST OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR MARKET, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO

CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS,

38

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

ARE NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED EXPENSE INCLUDES: PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES;

ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS

ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

AT FAIR VALUE.

(B)

ALL OTHER INCOME FOR 2007 DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE MAINLY TO LOSSES ON LOAN SALES AND LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS.

(C)

NET INTEREST INCOME FOR 2007 INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EARNING ASSETS. THE DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME IN 2006 IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE

IN TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME CAUSED BY A HIGHER PROPORTION OF NON-INTEREST-BEARING NET TRADING ASSETS TO TOTAL NET TRADING ASSETS, HIGHER FUNDING COSTS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, AND SPREAD COMPRESSION DUE TO THE INVERTED YIELD CURVE IN

PLACE FOR MOST OF 2006.

(D)

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX-EXEMPT INCOME FROM MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS AND INCOME TAX CREDITS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS, OF

$927 MILLION, $802 MILLION AND $752 MILLION FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

(E)

TSS WAS CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES MANAGED WITHIN THE IB CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS.

(F)

FOR 2006, THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO IS ADJUSTED TO PRESENT THIS RATIO AS IF SFAS 123R HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN EFFECT. IB MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTING THE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO FOR THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS 123R PROVIDES A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF IBS COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE RATIO.

BANKING FEES AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $18.2 BILLION, DOWN $663 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE $6.6

BILLION, UP 19% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY RECORD FEES ACROSS ADVISORY AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES. ADVISORY FEES WERE $2.3 BILLION, UP 37%, AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES WERE $1.7 BILLION, UP 45%;

BOTH WERE DRIVEN BY RECORD PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL REGIONS. DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.6 BILLION DECLINED 3%, REFLECTING LOWER LOAN SYNDICATION AND BOND UNDERWRITING FEES, WHICH WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF

THE YEAR. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE DECREASED 27% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO MARKDOWNS OF $1.4 BILLION (NET OF HEDGES) ON SUBPRIME POSITIONS, INCLUDING SUBPRIME CDOS AND MARKDOWNS OF $1.3 BILLION (NET OF FEES) ON LEVERAGE

LENDING FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE ALSO DECREASED DUE TO MARKDOWNS IN SECURITIZED PRODUCTS ON NONSUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND WEAK CREDIT TRADING PERFORMANCE. THESE LOWER RESULTS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY RECORD

REVENUE IN CURRENCIES AND STRONG REVENUE IN RATES. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $3.9 BILLION, UP 13%, BENEFITING FROM STRONG CLIENT ACTIVITY AND RECORD TRADING RESULTS ACROSS ALL

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION, UP 19%, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE FROM RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN SALES AND WORKOUTS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $654 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $463 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS DUE TO A NET INCREASE OF $532 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND AN INCREASE IN ALLOWANCE FOR UNFUNDED LEVERAGED LENDING COMMITMENTS, AS WELL AS PORTFOLIO GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE $36 MILLION OF

NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CURRENT YEAR, COMPARED WITH $31 MILLION OF NET RECOVERIES IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS 2.14% FOR 2007, COMPARED WITH A RATIO OF 1.79% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $13.1 BILLION, UP $214 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

RETURN ON

EQUITY WAS 15% ON $21.0 BILLION OF ALLOCATED CAPITAL COMPARED WITH 18% ON $20.8 BILLION IN 2006.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.7 BILLION WAS FLAT, AS RECORD REVENUE OF $18.8 BILLION WAS OFFSET LARGELY BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SFAS 123R, AND PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $18.8 BILLION WAS UP $3.7 BILLION, OR 25%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES

OF $5.5 BILLION WERE A RECORD, UP 35% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY RECORD DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS STRONG ADVISORY FEES, WHICH WERE THE HIGHEST SINCE 2000. ADVISORY FEES OF $1.7 BILLION WERE UP 31% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE AMERICAS. DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.7 BILLION WERE UP 37% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY RECORD PERFORMANCE IN BOTH LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND BOND UNDERWRITING. EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $1.2 BILLION WERE UP

36% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE OF $8.7 BILLION WAS ALSO A RECORD, UP 15% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN CREDIT MARKETS, EMERGING MARKETS AND CURRENCIES. RECORD EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE

OF $3.5 BILLION INCREASED 73%, AND WAS DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN CASH EQUITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUE OF $1.1 BILLION WAS DOWN 24%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $191 MILLION COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $838 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 2006 PROVISION REFLECTS PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY; CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED

STABLE. THE PRIOR-YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTED STRONG CREDIT QUALITY, A DECLINE IN CRITICIZED AND NONPERFORMING LOANS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF RECOVERIES.

TOTAL NONINTEREST

EXPENSE OF $12.9 BILLION WAS UP $2.6 BILLION, OR 26%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, AS

WELL AS THE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS 123R.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 18% ON $20.8 BILLION OF ALLOCATED CAPITAL COMPARED WITH 18% ON $20.0 BILLION IN 2005.

MILLION, OR 5%, DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION, WIDER LOAN SPREADS AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND A SHIFT TO NARROWERSPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST

REVENUE WAS $6.8 BILLION, UP $2.1 BILLION, BENEFITING FROM VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MSR ASSET; AN INCREASE IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES; THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR-YEAR $233 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO $13.3 BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO

HELD-FOR-SALE; AND INCREASED MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING REVENUE. NONINTEREST REVENUE ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS AS EXPENSE (LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS PREVIOUSLY NETTED AGAINST REVENUE COMMENCED BEING

RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159).

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.2 BILLION

WAS DOWN $214 MILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. A DECLINE IN MORTGAGE BANKING WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY IMPROVED RESULTS IN REGIONAL BANKING AND AUTO FINANCE.

MILLION, COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $120 MILLION IN 2005, WERE RECOGNIZED IN REGIONAL BANKING RELATED TO MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE; AND LOSSES OF $50 MILLION, COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $136 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WERE RECOGNIZED IN

AUTO FINANCE RELATED TO AUTOMOBILE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $561 MILLION WAS DOWN $163 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR

PROVISION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A $250 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $8.9 BILLION WAS UP $342 MILLION, OR 4%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION, THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE

FUNDING SERVICES, INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND MERGER-RELATED AND

OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND THE ABSENCE OF A $40 MILLION PRIOR-YEAR CHARGE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF AN EDUCATION LOAN JOINT VENTURE.

(A)

REGIONAL BANKING USES THE OVERHEAD RATIO (EXCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF CDI), A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING EXPENSE TRENDS OF THE BUSINESS. INCLUDING CDI

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE OVERHEAD RATIO CALCULATION RESULTS IN A HIGHER OVERHEAD RATIO IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND A LOWER OVERHEAD RATIO IN LATER YEARS; THIS METHOD WOULD RESULT IN AN IMPROVING OVERHEAD RATIO OVER TIME, ALL THINGS REMAINING EQUAL.

THIS NON-GAAP RATIO EXCLUDES REGIONAL BANKINGS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND THE BANK ONE MERGER OF $460 MILLION, $458 MILLION AND $496 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

REGIONAL BANKING NET INCOME WAS $2.3 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $583 MILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $13.0 BILLION, UP $1.0 BILLION, OR 9%, BENEFITING FROM THE FOLLOWING: THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION; INCREASED DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES; THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR-YEAR $233 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO $13.3 BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE; GROWTH IN DEPOSITS; AND WIDER LOAN SPREADS. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND A SHIFT TO NARROWERSPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $2.2 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $354 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN THE PROVISION WAS DUE TO THE HOME EQUITY AND

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIOS (SEE RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES DISCUSSION OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR FURTHER DETAIL). NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $7.0 BILLION, UP $198 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND

INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

REGIONAL BANKING NET INCOME OF $2.9 BILLION WAS UP $104 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $12.0 BILLION WAS UP $303 MILLION, OR 3%, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF A $233

MILLION 2006 LOSS RESULTING FROM $13.3 BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE AND A PRIOR-YEAR LOSS OF $120 MILLION RESULTING FROM $3.3 BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE. RESULTS BENEFITED FROM THE BANK OF NEW

YORK TRANSACTION; THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES; GROWTH IN DEPOSITS AND HOME EQUITY LOANS; AND INCREASES IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND CREDIT CARD SALES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS,

NARROWER SPREADS ON LOANS, AND A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED $158 MILLION, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A $230 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION IN THE PRIOR YEAR RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, WHICH WAS

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY ADDI-

TIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF LOANS FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK AND INCREASED NET CHARGE-OFFS DUE TO PORTFOLIO SEASONING AND

DETERIORATION IN SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $6.8 BILLION WAS UP $150 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION AND THE ACQUISITION OF

COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, MERGER SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, AND THE ABSENCE OF A $40 MILLION PRIOR-YEAR CHARGE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF AN EDUCATION LOAN JOINT VENTURE.

$646 MILLION, OR 48%. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159, HIGHER SERVICING COSTS DUE TO INCREASED DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS, AND HIGHER PRODUCTION EXPENSE DUE PARTLY TO GROWTH

IN ORIGINATIONS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

MORTGAGE BANKING NET LOSS WAS $17

MILLION COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $379 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $1.3 BILLION WAS DOWN $526 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A DECLINE IN NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION REVENUE.

MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WAS $481 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOAN SERVICING REVENUE OF $2.3 BILLION INCREASED $185 MILLION ON A 13% INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT

REVENUE OF NEGATIVE $379 MILLION WAS DOWN $655 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF A $235 MILLION NEGATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO THE MSR ASSET IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 DUE TO CHANGES AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE

MSR VALUATION MODEL. OTHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET, REPRESENTING RUNOFF OF THE ASSET AGAINST THE REALIZATION OF SERVICING CASH FLOWS, WERE NEGATIVE $1.4 BILLION. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.3 BILLION, UP $102 MILLION, OR 8%, DUE

AS A RESULT OF THE INTEGRATION OF CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND PAYMENTECH MERCHANT PROCESSING BUSINESSES INTO A JOINT VENTURE, BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, TOTAL NET

REVENUE, TOTAL NON-INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE WERE REDUCED TO REFLECT THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO NET INCOME. TO ILLUSTRATE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF CS

PERFORMANCE ASSUMES THAT THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH HAD OCCURRED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2005. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGES 109110, AND NOTE 31 ON PAGES 170173, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF CS MANAGED BASIS TO AN ADJUSTED BASIS TO DISCLOSE THE EFFECT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH ON CS RESULTS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME

OF $2.9 BILLION WAS DOWN $287 MILLION, OR 9%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. PRIOR-YEAR RESULTS BENEFITED FROM SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. THE INCREASE IN NET CHARGE-OFFS

WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER REVENUE.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS OF $157.1 BILLION INCREASED $4.2 BILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS OF

$149.3 BILLION INCREASED $8.2 BILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASES IN BOTH END-OF-PERIOD AND AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS RESULTED FROM ORGANIC GROWTH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $15.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $490 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $12.2 BILLION, UP $388 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF FEES AND HIGHER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES. THESE

BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS, THE DISCONTINUATION OF CERTAIN BILLING PRACTICES (INCLUDING THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN OVER-LIMIT FEES AND THE TWO-CYCLE BILLING METHOD FOR CALCULATING FINANCE CHARGES BEGINNING IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2007) AND THE EFFECT OF HIGHER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $3.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $102 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A HIGHER LEVEL OF FEE-BASED REVENUE

AND INCREASED NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, WHICH BENEFITED FROM HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME. CHARGE VOLUME GROWTH OF 4% REFLECTED A 9% INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME, OFFSET PRIMARILY BY A LOWER LEVEL OF BALANCE TRANSFERS, THE RESULT OF MORE TARGETED MARKETING

EFFORTS.

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $5.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.1 BILLION, OR 24%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

HIGHER LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS (THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005) AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DRIVEN BY HIGHER ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE

MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 3.68%, UP FROM 3.33% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 3.48%, UP FROM 3.13% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST

EXPENSE WAS $4.9 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $172 MILLION, OR 3%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE AND LOWER FRAUD-RELATED EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSE.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $3.2 BILLION WAS UP $1.3 BILLION, OR 68%, FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BANKRUPTCY FILINGS.

END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS OF $152.8 BILLION

INCREASED $10.6 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. AVERAGE MANAGED LOANS OF $141.1 BILLION INCREASED $4.7 BILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, BOTH AVERAGE MANAGED AND END-OF-PERIOD MANAGED LOANS CONTINUED TO BE

AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY HIGHER CUSTOMER PAYMENT RATES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGHER PAYMENT RATES ARE THE NEW MINIMUM PAYMENT RULES AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS IN REWARDS-BASED PROGRAMS.

2006 BENEFITED FROM ORGANIC GROWTH AND REFLECTED ACQUISITIONS OF TWO LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRST PORTFOLIO WAS THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, WHICH CLOSED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. THE SEARS CANADA PORTFOLIOS AVERAGE

MANAGED LOAN BALANCES WERE $2.1 BILLION IN 2006 AND $291 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE SECOND PURCHASE WAS THE KOHLS CORPORATION (KOHLS) PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO, WHICH CLOSED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. THE KOHLS

PORTFOLIO AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END MANAGED LOAN BALANCES FOR 2006 WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGED TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $14.7 BILLION WAS DOWN

$186 MILLION, OR 1%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $11.8 BILLION WAS FLAT TO THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME BENEFITED FROM AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE MANAGED LOAN BALANCES AND LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CHARGE-OFFS.

THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY ATTRITION OF MATURE, HIGHER SPREAD BALANCES AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PAYMENT RATES AND HIGHER COST OF FUNDS ON BALANCE GROWTH IN PROMOTIONAL, INTRODUCTORY AND TRANSACTOR LOAN BALANCES, WHICH INCREASED DUE TO CONTINUED

INVESTMENT IN MARKETING. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $2.9 BILLION WAS DOWN $197 MILLION, OR 6%. INTERCHANGE INCOME INCREASED, BENEFITING FROM 12% HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME, BUT WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, INCLUDING

KOHLS, AND INCREASED REWARDS EXPENSE (BOTH OF WHICH ARE NETTED AGAINST INTERCHANGE INCOME).

THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.6 BILLION, DOWN $2.7

BILLION, OR 37%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS BENEFIT WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $2.4 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED LOW LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CONTRACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE

PROVISION ALSO BENEFITED FROM A RELEASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2006 OF UNUSED RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE DECREASED

TO 3.33%, FROM 5.21% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 3.13%, UP FROM 2.79% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $5.1 BILLION WAS UP

$476 MILLION, OR 10%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE LARGELY TO HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING AND ACQUISITIONS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MERGER SAVINGS.

ON

OCTOBER 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE BANK OF NEW YORKS CONSUMER, BUSINESS BANKING AND MIDDLE-MARKET BANKING BUSINESSES, ADDING APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION IN LOANS AND $1.2 BILLION IN DEPOSITS TO THE COMMERCIAL

BANK.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME WAS $1.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$124 MILLION, OR 12%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN TOTAL NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

RECORD TOTAL NET

REVENUE OF $4.1 BILLION INCREASED $303 MILLION, OR 8%. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $2.8 BILLION INCREASED $113 MILLION, OR 4%, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN LIABILITY BALANCES AND LOANS, WHICH REFLECTED ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE BANK OF NEW YORK

TRANSACTION, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED SHIFT TO NARROWERSPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS AND SPREAD COMPRESSION IN THE LOAN AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION,

UP $190 MILLION, OR 18%, DUE TO INCREASED DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE, AND GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN THE SATISFACTION OF DEBT.

ON A SEGMENT BASIS, MIDDLE MARKET BANKING REVENUE WAS $2.7 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $154 MILLION, OR 6%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION, HIGHER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES AND GROWTH IN INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE. MID-CORPORATE

BANKING REVENUE WAS $815 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $159 MILLION, OR 24%, REFLECTING HIGHER LENDING REVENUE, INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE, AND GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN THE SATISFACTION OF DEBT. REAL ESTATE BANKING REVENUE OF $421 MILLION

DECREASED $37 MILLION, OR 8%.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $279 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $160 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES REFLECTED PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY INCLUDING SLIGHTLY LOWER CREDIT QUALITY AS WELL AS GROWTH IN LOAN BALANCES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO AVERAGE LOANS RETAINED WAS 2.81%, COMPARED WITH 2.86% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.0 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $21 MILLION, OR 1%, LARGELY DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSE GROWTH RELATED TO THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRANSACTION.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME OF $1.0 BILLION INCREASED $59 MILLION, OR 6%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSE AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

RECORD TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $3.8 BILLION INCREASED 9%, OR $312 MILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED TO $2.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES AND LOAN

VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOAN SPREAD COMPRESSION AND A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $1.1 BILLION, UP $87 MILLION, OR 9%, DUE TO RECORD INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE AND HIGHER COMMERCIAL CARD REVENUE.

REVENUE GREW FOR EACH CB BUSINESS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED TREASURY SERVICES, INVESTMENT BANKING AND LENDING REVENUE. COMPARED WITH THE

PRIOR YEAR, MIDDLE MARKET BANKING REVENUE OF $2.5 BILLION INCREASED $177 MILLION, OR 8%. MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE OF $656 MILLION INCREASED $105 MILLION, OR 19%, AND REAL ESTATE BANKING REVENUE OF $458 MILLION INCREASED $24 MILLION, OR 6%.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $160 MILLION, UP FROM $73 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS ACQUIRED FROM THE BANK OF NEW YORK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A RELEASE OF THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE SPECIAL RESERVE ESTABLISHED IN 2005 FOR HURRICANE KATRINA. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONPERFORMING LOANS DECLINED 56%, TO $121 MILLION.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $2.0 BILLION INCREASED $123 MILLION, OR 7%, FROM LAST YEAR, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS 123R AND INCREASED EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER CLIENT USAGE OF TREASURY SERVICES PRODUCTS.

PARTIALLY BY A SHIFT TO NARROWER-SPREAD LIABILITY PRODUCTS. TSS FIRMWIDE NET REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES TREASURY SERVICES NET REVENUE RECORDED IN OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, GREW TO $8.6 BILLION, UP $778 MILLION, OR 10%. TREASURY SERVICES FIRMWIDE NET

REVENUE GREW TO $5.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $305 MILLION, OR 6%.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $4.3 BILLION, UP $216 MILLION, OR 5%. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY, BUSINESS GROWTH, INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT PLATFORMS AND INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS 123R, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR CHARGES OF $93 MILLION RELATED TO THE

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006

NET INCOME WAS A RECORD $2.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $557 MILLION, OR 40%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS BENEFITED FROM RECORD NET REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE.

NET REVENUE WAS $8.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 BILLION, OR 27%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST REVENUE, PRIMARILY FEES AND COMMISSIONS, WAS $7.5 BILLION, UP $1.7 BILLION, OR

29%, LARGELY DUE TO INCREASED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $1.2 BILLION, UP $189 MILLION, OR 19%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES.

INSTITUTIONAL REVENUE GREW 28%, TO $2.5 BILLION,

DUE TO NET ASSET INFLOWS AND PERFORMANCE FEES. PRIVATE BANK REVENUE GREW 37%, TO $2.6 BILLION, DUE TO HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES, AND INCREASED LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. RETAIL REVENUE GREW 28%, TO $2.4 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET APPRECIATION AND NET ASSET INFLOWS. PRIVATE CLIENT SERVICES REVENUE GREW 7%, TO $1.1 BILLION, REFLECTING HIGHER ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $18 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $28 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $937 MILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND

INVESTMENTS IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

2006 COMPARED WITH 2005

NET INCOME

WAS A RECORD $1.4 BILLION, UP $193 MILLION, OR 16%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IMPROVED RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R AND THE

ABSENCE OF A TAX CREDIT RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS A RECORD $6.8 BILLION, UP $1.1 BILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST REVENUE,

PRINCIPALLY FEES AND COMMISSIONS, OF $5.8 BILLION WAS UP $1.2 BILLION, OR 27%. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE LARGELY TO INCREASED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND PLACEMENT FEES. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $971 MILLION, DOWN $110 MILLION, OR

10%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO NARROWER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES.

INSTITUTIONAL REVENUE GREW 41%, TO $2.0 BILLION, DUE TO NET ASSET INFLOWS AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE FEES. PRIVATE BANK REVENUE GREW 13%, TO $1.9 BILLION, DUE TO INCREASED PLACEMENT ACTIVITY, HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES AND HIGHER

DEPOSIT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER AVERAGE SPREADS ON DEPOSITS. RETAIL REVENUE GREW 22%, TO $1.9 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET ASSET INFLOWS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF BROWNCO. PRIVATE CLIENT SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED 1%, TO $1.0

BILLION, AS HIGHER DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY NARROWER AVERAGE DEPOSIT AND LOAN SPREADS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $28

MILLION COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $56 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 2006 BENEFIT REFLECTS A HIGH LEVEL OF RECOVERIES AND STABLE CREDIT QUALITY.

TOTAL NONINTEREST

EXPENSE OF $4.6 BILLION WAS UP $718 MILLION, OR 19%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO SFAS 123R, INCREASED SALARIES AND BENEFITS RELATED TO BUSINESS GROWTH, AND HIGHER

MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO HIGHBRIDGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF BROWNCO.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006.

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS;

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES BORROWED; FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM UTILIZES DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED, AND FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE THE FIRMS CASH POSITIONS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND TO SUPPORT THE FIRMS TRADING ACTIVITIES AND ITS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE USED AS SHORT-TERM FUNDING SOURCES. THE INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED

REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF FUNDS THAT WERE AVAILABLE FOR SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND A HIGHER VOLUME OF SECURITIES NEEDED FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE DECREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER LEVEL OF AFS SECURITIES IN TREASURY, PARTLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER AMOUNTS TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES 7073 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRM USES DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS FOR BOTH MARKET-MAKING AND

PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE DEBT; EQUITY, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES; LOANS; AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. THE INCREASE IN

TRADING ASSETS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MORE ACTIVE CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, WITH GROWTH IN CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY FOR DEBT SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, A TOTAL OF $33.8 BILLION OF LOANS ARE

NOW ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159 AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE TRADING ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 159 ARE PRIMARILY CERTAIN PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS WAREHOUSED BY RFS FOR SALE OR SECURITIZATION

PURPOSES, AND LOANS WAREHOUSED BY IB. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 5 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES 119121 AND 122, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM UTILIZES VARIOUS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY, CREDIT

AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES FOR MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING AND RISK-MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. BOTH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE AND

INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS DUE TO INCREASED CREDIT SPREADS AND LOWER INTEREST RATES, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, NOTE 6 AND NOTE 30 ON PAGES 7982, 122 AND

168169, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

ALMOST ALL

OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS CLASSIFIED AS AFS AND IS USED PRIMARILY TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS. THE AFS PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF

SECURITIES IN TREASURY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION AND TO NOTE 12 ON PAGES 5960 AND 134136, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES,

FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP OF EACH PORTFOLIO AND DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF LOAN ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF

RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. LOANS INCREASED $36.2 BILLION, OR 8%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH IN WHOLESALE LENDING ACTIVITY, MAINLY IN IB, CB AND AM; ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO; AND THE DECISION DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007 TO RETAIN RATHER THAN SELL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY A DECLINE IN CONSUMER LOANS AS CERTAIN PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS

AND ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN LOANS WAREHOUSED IN THE IB WERE TRANSFERRED TO TRADING ASSETS ON JANUARY 1, 2007, AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCREASED $2.0 BILLION, OR

27%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE INCREASED $1.5 BILLION AND $443 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PORTION OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS DUE TO INCREASES OF $1.2 BILLION IN RFS,

REFLECTING HIGHER ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO HOME EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, AND $231 MILLION IN CS, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PORTION OF THE

ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN GROWTH IN IB AND CB. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7389 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ARISES FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE COST

OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE NET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS BY TSS AND CS, AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THE SEARS CANADA

CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WAS A REDUCTION RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48, AS WELL AS TAX-RELATED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTES 18 AND 26 ON PAGES 154157 AND

164165, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE FIRMS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF MSRS, PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, OTHER CREDIT CARD-RELATED INTANGIBLES, CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND ALL OTHER INTANGIBLES. THE SLIGHT DECLINE IN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS REFLECTS

AMORTIZATION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CREDIT CARD BUSINESS-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES. THIS DECREASE WAS OFFSET LARGELY BY AN INCREASE IN THE MSR ASSET, AS ADDITIONS FROM LOAN SALES AND PURCHASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY FAIR

VALUE CHANGES REFLECTING MODELED SERVICING PORTFOLIO RUNOFF AND NEGATIVE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, AS DECLINING INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 DROVE AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE RFSS MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS DISCUSSION AND NOTE 18 ON PAGES 4647 AND 154157 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DEPOSITS

THE FIRMS DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS, BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE, FOR FUNDS HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED BY LOCATION (U.S. AND

NON-U.S.), WHETHER THEY ARE INTEREST OR NONINTEREST-BEARING, AND BY TYPE (I.E., DEMAND, MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, SAVINGS, TIME OR NEGOTIABLE ORDER OF WITHDRAWAL ACCOUNTS). DEPOSITS HELP PROVIDE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE

FIRM. DEPOSITS ROSE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET INCREASE IN WHOLESALE INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS IN TSS, AM AND CB, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE RFS, TSS, AND AM SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS AND THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 4348, 5455, 5658, AND 7073, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES, INCLUDING DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE CB AND

TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 5253 AND 5455, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM UTILIZES COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO COVER SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, AND IN CONNECTION WITH TSSS CASH

MANAGEMENT PRODUCT WHEREBY CLIENTS EXCESS FUNDS, PRIMARILY IN TSS, CB AND RFS, ARE TRANSFERRED INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS. THE INCREASES IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE FIRMS

ONGOING EFFORTS TO BUILD FURTHER LIQUIDITY, GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES IN SWEEP ACCOUNTS AND HIGHER SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE PAGES

7073 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

THE FIRM UTILIZES LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES TO BUILD LIQUIDITY AS PART OF ITS LONGER-TERM LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

INCREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, REFLECTING NET NEW ISSUANCES, INCLUDING CLIENT-DRIVEN STRUCTURED NOTES IN THE IB. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

7073 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TOTAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED $7.4 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2006 TO $123.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF NET INCOME FOR 2007, NET SHARES ISSUED UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

PLANS, AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON RETAINED EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES OF $915 MILLION. THESE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY STOCK REPURCHASES AND THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS. THE $915 MILLION INCREASE IN RETAINED EARNINGS

RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES PRIMARILY REFLECTED $287 MILLION RELATED TO SFAS 157, $199 MILLION RELATED TO SFAS 159 AND $436 MILLION RELATED TO FIN 48 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL, SEE

THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SECTION THAT FOLLOWS; FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGES, SEE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS ON PAGE 99, NOTE 4 ON PAGES 111118, NOTE 5 ON PAGES 119121 AND NOTE 26 ON PAGES 164165 OF

TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL ABOVE THESE

REQUIREMENTS IN AMOUNTS DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE MANAGEMENTS REGULATORY AND DEBT RATING OBJECTIVES. THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IS INTEGRATED INTO THE FIRMS CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND IS OVERSEEN BY ALCO.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL

IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS;



MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. CAPITAL IS ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LINE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE MERGER. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THIS METHODOLOGY

ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL SUPPORTING ACQUISITION-RELATED GOODWILL. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE FIRM ASSIGNED TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AN AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL EQUAL TO THE

THEN-CURRENT BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL FROM AND PRIOR TO THE MERGER. RETURN ON EQUITY IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS A KEY MEASURE OF A BUSINESS SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE. THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS EQUITY

CAPITAL-ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142, THE LINES OF BUSINESS PERFORM THE REQUIRED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT TESTING, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND NOTE 18 ON PAGES 9698 AND 154157, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RELATIVE TO THE RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT

METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM MEASURES ECONOMIC CAPITAL PRIMARILY BASED UPON FOUR RISK FACTORS: CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (IB, CB, TSS AND AM) AND CONSUMER

BUSINESSES (RFS AND CS).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND

DECLINES IN THE PORTFOLIO VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION, MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVEL OF CAPITALIZATION NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A TARGETED AA CREDIT RATING. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE LOSSES

IN EXCESS OF THOSE FOR WHICH PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE MAINTAINED. THE CAPITAL METHODOLOGY IS BASED UPON SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD, CREDIT SPREADS, LOSS

SEVERITY AND PORTFOLIO CORRELATION.

IN 2007, AN UPDATED CAPITAL METHODOLOGY WAS INTRODUCED FOR CREDIT EXPOSURES IN THE IB AND FOR CERTAIN NON-IB CREDIT EXPOSURES

RELATED TO PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITIES. THE UPDATED METHODOLOGY INCLUDES A THROUGH-THE-CYCLE ADJUSTMENT TO CAPITAL LEVELS THAT REFLECTS CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE NEEDED ACROSS THE VARIOUS CREDIT CYCLES. CAPITAL METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED ACROSS ALL WHOLESALE

BUSINESSES NOW EMPLOY A THROUGH-THE-CYCLE APPROACH.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS BASED UPON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL

SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO THE TARGETED AA CREDIT RATING. STATISTICAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OR PORTFOLIOS ARE

ADJUSTED TO ENSURE THAT CAPITAL IS CONSISTENT WITH EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION LEVELS ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR CAPITAL HELD AT REPRESENTATIVE MONOLINE COMPETITORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE

MOVEMENTS IN MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, SECURITIES PRICES AND COMMODITIES PRICES. DAILY VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR), MONTHLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE

APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS-TEST EXPOSURES. SEE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 9094 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL RISK ON A BOTTOM-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED UPON ACTUAL LOSSES AND

POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT OR THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL II

FRAMEWORK AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT FOR QUALIFICATION UNDER THE BASEL II ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE

POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY LIQUIDITY RISK. THE CAPITAL

ALLOCATION FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS BASED UPON MEASUREMENT OF THE LOSS EXPERIENCE SUFFERED BY THE FIRM AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ADVERSE EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD) ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED A WELL-CAPITALIZED POSITION, BASED UPON TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

INCREASE OF $7.7 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO NET INCOME OF $15.4 BILLION; NET ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OF $3.9 BILLION; NET ISSUANCES OF $2.0 BILLION OF QUALIFYING TRUST

PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES; AND THE AFTER-TAX EFFECTS OF THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REFLECTING INCREASES OF $287 MILLION FOR SFAS 157, $199 MILLION FOR SFAS 159 AND $436 MILLION FOR FIN 48. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY DECREASES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY NET OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) DUE TO COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES OF $8.2 BILLION AND DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $5.2 BILLION. IN ADDITION, THE CHANGE IN CAPITAL REFLECTS THE EXCLUSION OF AN

$882 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO CERTAIN LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO SFAS 157 TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS CAPITAL RATIOS AND THE FEDERAL REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS TO

WHICH IT IS SUBJECT IS PRESENTED IN NOTE 28 ON PAGES 166167 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BASEL

II

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION.

IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). THE GOAL OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG

LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH WILL REQUIRE JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT BASEL II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN KEY U.S. BANK

SUBSIDIARIES.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A QUALIFICATION PERIOD OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS DURING WHICH IT WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW RULE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS PRIMARY U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE CONSISTS OF THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD, STARTING ANY TIME

BETWEEN APRIL 1, 2008, AND APRIL 1, 2010, FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM TRANSITION PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD BASEL II RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT FALL BELOW CERTAIN FLOORS BASED ON CURRENT (BASEL I)

REGULATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT BASEL II RULES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

DIVIDENDS

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND POLICY REFLECTS JPMORGAN CHASES

EARNINGS OUTLOOK, DESIRED DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS, NEED TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVEL AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO TARGET A DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 3040% OF NET INCOME OVER TIME. ON

APRIL 17, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND TO $0.38 PER SHARE.

STOCK REPURCHASES

ON APRIL 17, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON SHARES, WHICH SUPERSEDES AN $8.0 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2006. THE $10.0 BILLION AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED

TO OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY;

THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES, MAY BE

EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS, AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2007, UNDER THE RESPECTIVE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS THEN IN EFFECT, THE FIRM REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 168 MILLION SHARES FOR $8.2 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $48.60. DURING 2006, UNDER THE RESPECTIVE STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAMS THEN IN EFFECT, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 91 MILLION SHARES FOR $3.9 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $43.41.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, $6.2 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED UNDER THE CURRENT STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT IT MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME,

ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE SHARES

DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS ESTABLISHED

WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF-

BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) AND LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING

SECURITIES TO INVESTORS IN THE FORM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, SHORT-TERM ASSET-BACKED NOTES, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTEREST. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED

WITH SPES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND AS A RESULT OF ITS LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, THROUGH QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (QSPES). THIS DISCUSSION FOCUSES MOSTLY ON MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ALL SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, AND THE RELATED ACCOUNTING, SEE NOTE 1 ON PAGE 108, NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 AND NOTE 17 ON PAGES 146154 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT

ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES

PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WAS DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY P-1, A-1

AND F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS WAS $94.0 BILLION AND $74.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN

CHASE BANK, N.A., WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF PROVIDING FUNDING UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT, OR IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN

THE SPE IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY. THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AS SHOWN IN THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES TABLE ON PAGE 68 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH THREE TYPES OF SPES. A SUMMARY OF EACH TYPE OF SPE FOLLOWS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM HELPS CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM.

THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES

FEES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURING OF MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND RECEIVES COMPENSATION FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF

VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED

SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES THE FIRM USES IN THESE STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES AND COLLATERALIZED DEBT

OBLIGATIONS VEHICLES.

LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND

SELLS A VARIETY OF ITS CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS, INCLUDING WAREHOUSE LOANS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED IN TRADING ASSETS, THROUGH SPES THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 108 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). THE

PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE VEHICLES IS TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS AND TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM THROUGH THE SALE OF THE LOANS TO THE QSPES. CONSUMER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SECURITIZATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND

EDUCATION LOANS THAT ARE ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY RFS AND CS. WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SECURITIZATIONS OF PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY REAL ESTATE-RELATED) ORIGINATED BY THE IB.

AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS MODIFICATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM (ASF) ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND LOSS AVOIDANCE FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE

MORTGAGE LOANS (THE FRAMEWORK). THE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR SERVICERS TO STREAMLINE EVALUATION PROCEDURES OF BORROWERS WITH CERTAIN SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE (ARM) LOANS TO MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY

PROVIDE MODIFICATION OF SUCH LOANS WITH TERMS THAT ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SUCH BORROWERS. THE FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL FIRST-LIEN SUBPRIME ARM LOANS THAT HAVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF 36 MONTHS OR

LESS, ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIZED POOLS, WERE ORIGINATED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005, AND JULY 31, 2007, AND HAVE AN INITIAL INTEREST RATE RESET DATE BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2008, AND JULY 31, 2010. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ADOPTED THE

FRAMEWORK, AND IT EXPECTS TO BEGIN MODIFYING ELIGIBLE LOANS BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE FRAMEWORK, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGE 145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G.,

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO

FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT,

THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE,

UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7389 AND NOTE 31 ON PAGES 170173 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE

FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. COMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE FUTURE SERVICES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO REAL ESTATERELATED

OBLIGATIONS AND EQUIPMENT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE SUMMARIZES, BY REMAINING MATURITY, JPMORGAN CHASES OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE TABLE BELOW REFLECT THE MINIMUM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION UNDER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT ARE

BOTH FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE ARE A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS TO BE SETTLED IN CASH, PRIMARILY IN UNDER ONE YEAR. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS

PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; COMMERCIAL PAPER; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; PURCHASES OF DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS; DERIVATIVE PAYABLES; AND CERTAIN PURCHASES OF INSTRUMENTS THAT RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT FAILURES. ALSO

EXCLUDED ARE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED. FOR DISCUSSION REGARDING LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 21 ON PAGES 159160 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION: THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS DEALINGS, INCLUDING LENDING, TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, IS IDENTIFIED AND

AGGREGATED THROUGH THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE.



RISK MEASUREMENT: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS

TESTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUTINELY REVIEWED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECT UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL: THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCORPORATE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT,

INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING: RISK REPORTING IS EXECUTED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, AND REPUTATION RISK.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE

STRUCTURE STARTS WITH EACH LINE OF BUSINESS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING ITS OWN RISKS. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS WORKS CLOSELY WITH RISK MANAGEMENT THROUGH ITS OWN RISK COMMITTEE

AND, IN MOST CASES, ITS OWN CHIEF RISK OFFICER TO MANAGE RISK. EACH LINE

OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING THE BUSINESS RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AND CONTROLS.

OVERLAYING THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

MANAGEMENT ARE FOUR CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK MANAGEMENTRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING TREASURY, THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS HEADED BY THE FIRMS CHIEF RISK OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE AND WHO REPORTS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE

BOARDS RISK POLICY COMMITTEE. RISK MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A FIRMWIDE FUNCTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS. WITHIN RISK MANAGEMENT ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY

RISK, AS WELL AS RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS. RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK POLICY AND METHODOLOGY, RISK REPORTING AND RISK EDUCATION; AND RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING

THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

TREASURY AND THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING,

REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY, INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE HAS OVERSIGHT FOR LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, AN ALCO AND TWO

RISK COMMITTEES, NAMELY, THE RISK WORKING GROUP AND THE MARKETS COMMITTEE. THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF LINE OF BUSINESS, RISK MANAGEMENT, FINANCE AND OTHER SENIOR

EXECUTIVES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OVERSEES GLOBAL MERGER AND

ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY, INCLUDING CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANNING AND EXPOSURE TO SPES (AND ANY REQUIRED LIQUIDITY SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF SUCH SPES). THE ASSET-LIABILITY

COMMITTEE ALSO OVERSEES THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF BUSINESS TRANSFER INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK TO TREASURY IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT).

THE RISK WORKING GROUP MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW ISSUES SUCH AS RISK POLICY, RISK METHODOLOGY, BASEL II AND REGULATORY ISSUES AND TOPICS REFERRED TO IT BY ANY LINE OF BUSINESS RISK

COMMITTEE. THE MARKETS COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEETS WEEKLY TO

REVIEW AND DETERMINE APPROPRIATE COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISK MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIMITS; CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK; LARGE, HIGH

RISK TRANSACTIONS; AND HEDGING STRATEGIES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY

COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT

IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE GOAL OF LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT

COST-EFFECTIVE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO MEET ACTUAL AND CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER TIME.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES A CENTRALIZED APPROACH FOR LIQUIDITY RISK

MANAGEMENT. GLOBAL FUNDING IS MANAGED BY TREASURY, USING REGIONAL EXPERTISE AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A CENTRALIZED FRAMEWORK MAXIMIZES LIQUIDITY ACCESS, MINIMIZES FUNDING COSTS AND PERMITS GLOBAL IDENTIFICATION AND COORDINATION OF

LIQUIDITY RISK.

GOVERNANCE

ALCO APPROVES AND OVERSEES THE EXECUTION OF

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. TREASURY FORMULATES THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING STRATEGIES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK

PROFILE.

LIQUIDITY MONITORING AND RECENT ACTIONS

TREASURY MONITORS

HISTORICAL LIQUIDITY TRENDS, TRACKS HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS, IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY WARNING SIGNALS TO PERMIT EARLY DETECTION OF LIQUIDITY ISSUES, AND MANAGES

CONTINGENCY PLANNING (INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION AND TESTING OF VARIOUS COMPANY-SPECIFIC AND MARKET-DRIVEN STRESS SCENARIOS). VARIOUS TOOLS, WHICH TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERALL LIQUIDITY PERSPECTIVE, ARE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY. THESE

INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF THE TIMING OF LIQUIDITY SOURCES VERSUS LIQUIDITY USES (I.E., FUNDING GAPS) OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM OVERNIGHT TO ONE YEAR; MANAGEMENT OF DEBT AND CAPITAL ISSUANCE TO ENSURE THAT THE ILLIQUID PORTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET CAN BE

FUNDED BY EQUITY, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AND DEPOSITS THE FIRM BELIEVES TO BE STABLE; AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRMS CAPACITY TO RAISE INCREMENTAL UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING.

LIQUIDITY OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES IS

MONITORED SEPARATELY FROM THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES. AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, LONG-TERM FUNDING IS MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS NONBANK

SUBSIDIARIES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES, THE FOCUS OF LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS ON MAINTENANCE OF UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY SUFFICIENT TO MEET ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

AN EXTENSION OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THE FIRMS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE GOAL OF THE PLAN IS TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY DURING NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. THE PLAN

CONSIDERS VARIOUS TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS WHERE ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS SEVERELY LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, AND SEPARATELY EVALUATES ACCESS TO FUNDS BY THE PARENT

HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.

IN RESPONSE TO THE MARKET TURMOIL IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2007,

JPMORGAN CHASE TOOK VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION. IN ANTICIPATION OF POSSIBLE INCREMENTAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED FROM DRAWS UNDER UNFUNDED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES AND/OR POTENTIAL

CONSOLIDATION OR PURCHASE OF ASSETS FROM VIES, THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY INCREASED ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES INCREASED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE UNSECURED FUNDING

LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., MAINTAINED SUFFICIENT SECURED BORROWING CAPACITY, WHEN AGGREGATED WITH UNSECURED FUNDING SOURCES, TO COVER ANTICIPATED ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS OF BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINED STRONG BASED UPON ITS LIQUIDITY METRICS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

MANAGEMENT USES A VARIETY OF

UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING SOURCES TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MARKET CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THE DESIRED MATURITY PROFILE OF LIABILITIES. MARKETS ARE EVALUATED ON AN

ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE GLOBAL BALANCE OF UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING AT FAVORABLE RATES. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE FUNDING FROM A BROAD RANGE OF SOURCES IN A VARIETY OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ENHANCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY

AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON ANY ONE SOURCE. DIVERSIFICATION OF FUNDING IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.

DEPOSITS HELD BY THE

RFS, CB, TSS AND AM LINES OF BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF UNSECURED FUNDING FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE $740.7 BILLION. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS

DEPOSITS ARE RETAIL DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND THEREFORE ARE CONSIDERED MORE STABLE THAN MARKET-BASED WHOLESALE DEPOSITS. THE FIRM ALSO BENEFITS FROM STABLE WHOLESALE LIABILITY BALANCES ORIGINATED BY CB, TSS AND

AM THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. SUCH LIABILITY BALANCES INCLUDE DEPOSITS THAT ARE SWEPT TO ONBALANCE SHEET LIABILITIES (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS). THESE LIABILITY

BALANCES ARE ALSO A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FROM WHICH THEY ARE GENERATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF DEPOSIT AND LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES 40-58 AND 6162, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF UNSECURED FUNDS INCLUDE A

VARIETY OF SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK NOTES, LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. DECISIONS CONCERNING TIMING OF ISSUANCE AND THE TENOR OF LIABILITIES ARE BASED

UPON RELATIVE COSTS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PROSPECTIVE VIEWS OF BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND A TARGETED LIQUIDITY PROFILE.

FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS SECURED FUNDING FROM THE REPURCHASE AND ASSET SECURITIZATION MARKETS. THE FIRM MAINTAINS RESERVES OF UNENCUMBERED LIQUID SECURITIES THAT CAN BE FINANCED TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY. THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN COLLATERALIZED

FINANCING AGAINST LIQUID SECURITIES IS DEPENDENT ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED GAINS ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND YIELDS OF THE ASSETS

SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE ISSUING ENTITY. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE REFLECTED IN JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ARE DISCUSSED IN

THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS GENERALLY INCLUDE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, NOTE 16 AND NOTE 31 ON PAGES 6668, 139145 AND 170173, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BANK SUBSIDIARIES ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACCOUNT WINDOW IS AN

ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF SECURED FUNDING; HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT VIEW THIS AS A PRIMARY MEANS OF FUNDING THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

ISSUANCE

DURING 2007, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED $95.1 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THESE ISSUANCES INCLUDED $52.2 BILLION OF IB

STRUCTURED NOTES, THE ISSUANCES OF WHICH ARE GENERALLY CLIENT-DRIVEN AND NOT FOR FUNDING OR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AS THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY USED TO PURCHASE SECURITIES TO MITIGATE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH STRUCTURED

NOTE EXPOSURE. THE ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY $49.4 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES THAT MATURED OR WERE REDEEMED DURING 2007, INCLUDING IB

STRUCTURED NOTES. THE INCREASE IN TREASURY-ISSUED LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES WAS USED PRIMARILY TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE PARENT COMPANY AND TO BUILD LIQUIDITY. DURING 2007, COMMERCIAL PAPER

INCREASED $30.7 BILLION AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS INCREASED $10.8 BILLION. THE GROWTH IN BOTH COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS WAS USED TO BUILD LIQUIDITY FURTHER BY INCREASING THE AMOUNTS HELD OF LIQUID SECURITIES AND OF OVERNIGHT

INVESTMENTS THAT MAY BE READILY CONVERTED TO CASH. IN ADDITION, DURING 2007, THE FIRM SECURITIZED $28.9 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $21.2 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS AND $1.2 BILLION OF EDUCATION LOANS. THE FIRM DID NOT SECURITIZE ANY

AUTO LOANS DURING 2007. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN OF ITS TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANTS (RCCS) GRANTING CERTAIN RIGHTS TO THE HOLDERS OF COVERED DEBT, AS DEFINED IN THE RCCS, THAT PROHIBIT THE

REPAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR PURCHASE OF THE TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES EXCEPT, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO THE EXTENT THAT JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECEIVED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN QUALIFYING SECURITIES. CURRENTLY

THE FIRMS COVERED DEBT IS ITS 5.875% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES, SERIES O, DUE IN 2035. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THESE COVENANTS, REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE RESPECTIVE RCCS ENTERED INTO BY THE FIRM IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ISSUANCES OF SUCH TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH ARE FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER COVER OF FORMS 8-K.

CASH FLOWS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS DECREASED $268 MILLION, AND INCREASED $3.7 BILLION AND

$1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASES CASH FLOWS DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES

WAS $110.6 BILLION, $49.6 BILLION AND $30.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY

DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE. DURING EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, NET CASH WAS USED TO FUND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE PRIMARILY IN THE IB AND RFS. IN 2007, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CASH FLOWS FROM IB LOAN

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

ORIGINATIONS/PURCHASES AND SALE/SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFICULT WHOLESALE SECURITIZATION MARKET AND CAPITAL MARKETS FOR LEVERAGED FINANCINGS,

WHICH WERE AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. CASH FLOWS IN 2007 ASSOCIATED WITH RFS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES GREW REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ORIGINATIONS. THE AMOUNT AND

TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE FIRMS OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF THE LEVEL OF CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, MARKET CONDITIONS AND TRADING STRATEGIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH

FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND THE FIRMS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE FIRMS OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY

INVOLVE AFS SECURITIES, LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT AND FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2007, NET CASH OF $73.1 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY TO FUND PURCHASES IN TREASURYS AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS; NET ADDITIONS TO THE WHOLESALE

RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIOS IN THE IB, CB AND AM, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS GROWTH; A NET INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN RFS IN HOME EQUITY LOANS AND NET ADDITIONS TO RFSS SUBPRIME MORTGAGE

LOANS PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS DECISION IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO RETAIN (RATHER THAN SELL) NEW SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, AND GROWTH IN PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY RFS AND AM (AND HELD IN CORPORATE) THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES; AND INCREASES IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CONNECTION WITH

TREASURYS EFFORTS TO BUILD THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. THESE NET USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES; AND CREDIT CARD, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, EDUCATION AND WHOLESALE LOAN SALES

AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH GREW IN 2007 DESPITE THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, NET CASH OF

$99.6 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. NET CASH WAS INVESTED TO FUND NET ADDITIONS TO THE RETAINED WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MAINLY RESULTING FROM CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY IN IB LEVERAGED FINANCINGS; INCREASES IN CS LOANS REFLECTING STRONG

ORGANIC GROWTH; NET ADDITIONS IN RETAIL HOME EQUITY LOANS; THE ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE-LABEL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS FROM KOHLS, BP AND PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC.; THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES, AND TREASURY PURCHASES OF AFS

SECURITIES IN CONNECTION WITH REPOSITIONING THE PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS PROVIDED FROM CREDIT CARD, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, AUTO AND WHOLESALE LOAN SALES AND

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES; SALES AND MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES; THE NET DECLINE IN AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, WHICH WAS CAUSED PARTIALLY BY MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO DE-EMPHASIZE VEHICLE LEASING; AND THE SALE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AT THE

BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, NET CASH OF $12.9 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN CONSUMER LOANS, PRIMARILY

HOME EQUITY AND IN CS, REFLECTING GROWTH IN NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND A DECLINE IN AUTO LOANS REFLECTING A DIFFICULT AUTO LENDING MARKET.

NET CASH WAS GENERATED BY THE TREASURY INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY FROM MATURITIES OF SECURITIES, AS PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES ESSENTIALLY OFFSET EACH OTHER.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRMS FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND

LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CLIENT-DRIVEN STRUCTURED NOTES IN THE IB), AND ITS COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK.

IN 2007, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS

$183.0 BILLION DUE TO A NET INCREASE IN WHOLESALE DEPOSITS FROM GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES, IN PARTICULAR, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AT TSS, AM AND CB; NET ISSUANCES BY TREASURY OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES PRIMARILY

TO FUND CERTAIN ILLIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE PARENT COMPANY AND TO BUILD LIQUIDITY AND BY THE IB FROM CLIENT-DRIVEN STRUCTURED NOTES TRANSACTIONS; AND GROWTH IN COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS IN TREASURY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE

VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES IN SWEEP ACCOUNTS, IN TSS AND CB, HIGHER SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS AND TO FURTHER BUILD LIQUIDITY. CASH WAS USED TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING AN

INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007.

IN 2006, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $152.7 BILLION DUE TO NET CASH RECEIVED FROM

GROWTH IN DEPOSITS, REFLECTING NEW RETAIL ACCOUNT ACQUISITIONS AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; HIGHER WHOLESALE BUSINESS VOLUMES; INCREASES IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO FUND TRADING POSITIONS

AND HIGHER AFS SECURITIES POSITIONS IN TREASURY; AND NET ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON STOCK AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES.

IN 2005, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $45.1 BILLION DUE TO: GROWTH IN DEPOSITS, REFLECTING NEW RETAIL ACCOUNT ACQUISITIONS, THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF

THE RETAIL BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HIGHER WHOLESALE BUSINESS VOLUMES; AND NET NEW ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES; OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES.

THE SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND THE PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO AA- FROM A+. FITCH ALSO RAISED THE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. TO F1+ FROM

AA2, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION IN THESE RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND. KEY FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT

RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS

STREAM, LEADING MARKET POSITIONS, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

IF THE FIRMS RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF FUNDS AND THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF FUNDING TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. CURRENTLY, THE FIRM BELIEVES A DOWNGRADE IS UNLIKELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON DERIVATIVES

AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES ON PAGES 6667 AND RATINGS PROFILE OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MARK-TO-MARKET (MTM) ON PAGE 81, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT (FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH LOANS, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVES) TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES, FROM LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER. THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD

RELATIONSHIP OF EACH CREDIT EXTENSION AND DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF THE FIRMS RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

FIRMS WHOLESALE SYNDICATED LOAN ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKETPLACE (PRIMARILY TO IB CLIENTS), WITH RETAINED EXPOSURE HELD BY THE FIRM AVERAGING LESS THAN 10%. WHOLESALE LOANS GENERATED BY CB AND AM ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

WITH REGARD TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. WITHIN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE EITHER RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO,

OR SECURITIZED AND SOLD SELECTIVELY TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE

FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT



ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE



MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS



MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND

AGGREGATING EXPOSURES ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. LOSSES GENERATED BY CONSUMER LOANS ARE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN WHOLESALE LOSSES, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO CYCLICAL AND

SEASONAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF LOSS IS HIGHER ON CONSUMER LOANS THAN ON WHOLESALE LOANS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND MORE MANAGEABLE ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING

CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND CREDIT BUREAU SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK RATING) AND RISK

MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE PROBA-

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT

EVENT. BASED UPON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PRIMARILY ARE BASED

UPON STATISTICAL ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD BE FACTORED INTO PRICING AND

COVERED AS A NORMAL AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF LOSSES. RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A RISK-RATED BASIS; FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

RISK-RATED

EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED (GENERALLY HELD IN IB, CB, TSS AND AM), PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED UPON ESTIMATES OF

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE EXPECTED DEFAULT CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE BASED UPON COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY.

CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW. RISK RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED AND REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED, IF NEEDED, TO REFLECT

THE BORROWERS CURRENT RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL POSITIONS.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED UPON A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. PROBABLE LOSSES

ARE ESTIMATED USING SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, COMMON MEASURES OF CREDIT QUALITY DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE

USED TO PREDICT CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION SOURCES, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHARGE-OFF

POLICIES. THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE LOSSES. THESE FACTORS AND ANALYSES ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF EXTENDING CREDIT AND ARE INCLUDED TO ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE

POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURE. WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN

AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. FOR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS ITEMS ARE TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND

PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS.

IN ORDER TO MEET CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM SEEKS TO

MAINTAIN A RISK PROFILE THAT IS DIVERSE IN TERMS OF BORROWER, PRODUCT TYPE, INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES,

SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING RISK SECTIONS.

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT METRIC FORECASTS, HOLD-LIMIT

EXCEPTIONS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS MENTIONED ON PAGE 69 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2007 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

DESPITE THE VOLATILE CAPITAL

MARKETS ENVIRONMENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO OVERALL EXPERIENCED CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF NONPERFORMING LOANS AND CRITICIZED ASSETS. HOWEVER, IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, CREDIT MARKET LIQUIDITY LEVELS DECLINED

SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTED LOAN SYNDICATION MARKETS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN FUNDED AND UNFUNDED EXPOSURES, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO LEVERAGED LENDING, HELD ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THIS EXPOSURE IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CLIENTS AND

INDUSTRIES AND IS PERFORMING, BUT SUBJECT TO MARKET VOLATILITY AND POTENTIALLY FURTHER WRITEDOWNS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE EVENTS, THE FIRM HAS STRENGTHENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO ITS LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND LEVERAGED LENDING, CONSISTENT

WITH EVOLVING MARKET PRACTICE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UNFUNDED LEVERAGE ACQUISITIONS RELATED TO LOAN SYNDICATIONS, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES 170173 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN 2007, THE DOMESTIC CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE DETERIORATION IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS, LEADING TO INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES PRIMARILY FOR HOME EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS

WITH MULTIPLE RISK ELEMENTS (RISK LAYERED LOANS). THE FIRM RESPONDED TO THESE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO CREDIT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND REFINEMENT OF

PRICING AND RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS.

MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE DOMESTIC CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE 84 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, INCREASED $187.2 BILLION

FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, REFLECTING AN INCREASE OF $106.1 BILLION IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND $81.1 BILLION IN THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES. DURING 2007, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

DERIVATIVES INCREASED $21.5 BILLION. WITHIN LOANS, RFS LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE DECLINED, AS PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, WERE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN LOANS

WAREHOUSED IN IB WERE TRANSFERRED TO TRADING ASSETS ON JANUARY 1,

2007, AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159. ALSO EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, $24.7 BILLION OF PRIME MORTGAGES HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PURPOSES WERE TRANSFERRED FROM RFS ($19.4 BILLION) AND AM ($5.3 BILLION) TO THE CORPORATE SECTOR FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES. WHILE THIS TRANSFER HAD NO IMPACT ON THE RFS, AM OR CORPORATE FINANCIAL RESULTS, THE AM PRIME MORTGAGES THAT WERE TRANSFERRED ARE NOW REPORTED IN CONSUMER MORTGAGE LOANS.

IN THE TABLE BELOW, REPORTED LOANS INCLUDE LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WHICH ARE CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. HOWEVER, THESE

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES USED FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE CALCULATIONS.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE (IB, CB,

TSS AND AM) INCREASED $106.1 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, DUE TO INCREASES IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS OF $55.2 BILLION AND LOANS OF $29.3 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN OVERALL LENDING ACTIVITY WAS PARTLY DUE TO GROWTH IN LEVERAGED LENDING

FUNDED AND UNFUNDED EXPOSURES, MAINLY IN IB. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF UNFUNDED LEVERAGED EXPOSURES, SEE NOTE 31, ON PAGES 170173 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WAS

THE $21.5 BILLION DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS DUE TO INCREASED CREDIT SPREADS AND LOWER INTEREST RATES, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR.

UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE INCREASES ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO PORTFOLIO GROWTH. THE NOTABLE RISE IN ASSET MANAGERS WAS A RESULT OF PORTFOLIO GROWTH AND THE FIRM REVISING ITS INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2007 TO BETTER REFLECT RISK CORRELATIONS AND ENHANCE THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY RISK. BELOW ARE SUMMARIES OF THE TOP 10 INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS,

WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE

EXPOSURES DEEMED CRITICIZED GENERALLY REPRESENT A RATINGS PROFILE SIMILAR TO A RATING OF

CCC+/CAA1 AND LOWER, AS DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODYS. THE TOTAL CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF THE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE, INCREASED TO $6.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, FROM

$5.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2006. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY DOWNGRADES IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES,

BUILDING MATERIALS/ CONSTRUCTION AND TELECOM SERVICES MOVED INTO THE TOP 10 OF WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE, REPLACING AGRICULTURE/PAPER MANUFACTURING, BUSINESS SERVICES AND UTILITIES.

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIES THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR

POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE PRECEDING PAGE.



AUTOMOTIVE: AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS BASED IN NORTH AMERICA CONTINUED TO BE AFFECTED BY A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN 2007. AS A

RESULT, THE INDUSTRY CONTINUED TO BE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE REMAINS UNDRAWN, IS PERFORMING AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY SECURED.



REAL ESTATE: EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY GREW IN 2007 MAINLY DUE TO GROWTH IN LEVERAGED LENDING ACTIVITY, PRIMARILY IN THE IB. ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, THE FIRMS REAL ESTATE

EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED BY CLIENT, TRANSACTION TYPE, GEOGRAPHY AND PROPERTY TYPE. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS EXPOSURE IS TO LARGE PUBLIC AND RATED REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AND INSTITUTIONS (E.G., REITS), AS WELL AS REAL ESTATE LOANS ORIGINATED FOR

SALE INTO THE COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES MARKET. CMBS EXPOSURE TOTALED 5% OF THE CATEGORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THESE POSITIONS ARE ACTIVELY RISK MANAGED. THE REMAINING REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE IS PRIMARILY TO PROFESSIONAL REAL ESTATE

DEVELOPERS, OWNERS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND GENERALLY INVOLVES REAL ESTATE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY TENANTS. EXPOSURE TO NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME BUILDERS REPRESENTS 16% OF THE CATEGORY, DOWN FROM 21% IN 2006, AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE

AT A MANAGEABLE LEVEL. THE INCREASE IN CRITICIZED EXPOSURE WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES TO A SMALL GROUP OF HOMEBUILDERS WITHIN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO.



RETAIL AND CONSUMER SERVICES: IN 2007, CRITICIZED EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY INCREASED AS A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES OF SELECT PORTFOLIO NAMES. OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE

EXPOSURE REMAINS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE AND THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED BY CLIENT, GEOGRAPHY AND PRODUCT MARKET SERVED. THE BIGGER PORTFOLIO NAMES IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE TEND TO BE LARGE CAP COMPANIES WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS. FOR SMALLER CAP

CLIENTS WITH MORE RELIANCE ON BANK DEBT, EXPOSURES ARE OFTEN HIGHLY STRUCTURED AND/OR SECURED.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES: THIS INDUSTRY GROUP, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL BANKS, IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

EVEN THOUGH CRITICIZED EXPOSURES GREW IN 2007 DUE TO DOWNGRADES TO SELECT NAMES WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO, CREDIT QUALITY OVERALL REMAINED HIGH, AS 83% OF THE EXPOSURE IN THIS CATEGORY IS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE.



ALL OTHER: ALL OTHER IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION TABLE ON PAGE 78 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 (EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS

AT FAIR VALUE) INCLUDED $377.0 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO 22 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED TO SPES AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS WERE 34% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING (GENERALLY BACKED BY

RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR BONDS ON A BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE, NONRECOURSE OR LIMITED-RECOURSE BASIS) ORIGINATED BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF COMPANIES IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT HIGHLY CORRELATED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 146-154 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND NONE COMPRISE MORE THAN 3% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS; TO GENERATE REVENUE

THROUGH TRADING ACTIVITIES; TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS; AND TO MANAGE THE FIRMS CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE CONTRACTS, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 168169 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF $77.1 BILLION AND $55.6 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, IS THE AMOUNT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE (MTM) OR FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE

FIRM. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COST TO THE FIRM TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK SHOULD ALSO REFLECT ADDITIONAL

LIQUID SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL BY THE FIRM OF $9.8 BILLION AND $6.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN TOTAL EXPOSURE, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $67.3 BILLION AND $49.0 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

INCREASED $18.3 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE AND INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS DUE TO INCREASED CREDIT SPREADS AND LOWER INTEREST RATES, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR.

THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, BUT THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE CREDIT RISK OF THE

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL SECURES POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO SHOULD THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, THE FIRM HELD $17.4 BILLION AND $12.3 BILLION OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, RESPECTIVELY. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO

CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE), AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE

(AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF

EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT RISK EMBEDDED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL PEAK CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE, AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, CREDIT

RISK IS REDUCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH SEPARATE COUNTERPARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO TRADES CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS, EVEN IF BOTH COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIRM REFERS TO THIS EFFECT AS

MARKET DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK (MDP) MEASURE IS A PORTFOLIO AGGREGATION OF COUNTERPARTY PEAK MEASURES, REPRESENTING THE MAXIMUM LOSSES AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT WOULD OCCUR IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES

DEFAULTED UNDER ANY ONE GIVEN MARKET SCENARIO AND TIME FRAME.

DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISKINESS OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON

A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISKINESS OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR

CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS,

INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. AVERAGE EXPOSURE WAS $47.1 BILLION AND $35.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF $67.3 BILLION AND $49.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

80

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MTM

VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT

DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC

CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL FOR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRMS AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT QUALITY WITHIN THE CREDIT APPROVAL PROCESS. THE

FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE GRAPH TO THE RIGHT SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE MDP, DRE AND AVG METRICS. ALL THREE MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES

WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT

TO COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 82% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, FROM 80% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

THE FIRM POSTED $33.5 BILLION AND $26.6 BILLION

OF COLLATERAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST

COLLATERAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., FROM ITS RATING OF AA TO AA- AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $237 MILLION OF

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED BY THE FIRM. THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS DOWNGRADE (FROM AA TO BBB) WOULD HAVE REQUIRED $2.5 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION

OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION

PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS INCREASED $3.3 TRILLION FROM YEAR-END 2006 AS A RESULT OF INCREASED TRADE VOLUME IN THE MARKET. THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED WHEN SECURITIES USED TO RISK-MANAGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE POSITIONS

ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED TO A DURATION-BASED EQUIVALENT OR TO REFLECT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUBORDINATION IN TRANCHED STRUCTURES.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES

IN MANAGING ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM PURCHASES SINGLE-NAME AND PORTFOLIO CREDIT DERIVATIVES; THIS ACTIVITY

DOES NOT REDUCE THE REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR THE LEVEL OF REPORTED OFFBALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO DIVERSIFIES ITS EXPOSURES BY PROVIDING (I.E., SELLING) CREDIT PROTECTION, WHICH INCREASES EXPOSURE TO

INDUSTRIES OR CLIENTS WHERE THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CLIENT-RELATED EXPOSURE. THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE.

INCLUDED $31.1 BILLION AND $22.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, THAT REPRESENTED THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT FOR STRUCTURED PORTFOLIO PROTECTION; THE FIRM RETAINS A MINIMAL

FIRST RISK OF LOSS ON THIS PORTFOLIO.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 133, AND THEREFORE, EFFECTIVENESS TESTING UNDER SFAS 133 IS NOT PERFORMED. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. THE MTM VALUE INCORPORATES BOTH THE

COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PREMIUMS AND CHANGES IN VALUE DUE TO MOVEMENT IN SPREADS AND CREDIT EVENTS; IN CONTRAST, THE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS BEING RISK MANAGED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOAN INTEREST AND FEES ARE

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN NET INTEREST INCOME, AND IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THIS ASYMMETRY IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BETWEEN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES UTILIZED IN CREDIT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CAUSES EARNINGS VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE. THE MTM RELATED TO THE FIRMS CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED FOR

ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE AMOUNT FOR 2007 INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 ON JANUARY 1, 2008.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTIVELY MANAGES WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE MAINLY THROUGH IB AND CB LOAN AND COMMITMENT SALES. DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THESE SALES OF $4.9 BILLION, $4.0 BILLION

AND $4.9 BILLION OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTED IN LOSSES OF $7 MILLION IN 2007 AND GAINS OF $83 MILLION AND $81 MILLION IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS INCLUDE GAINS ON SALES OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, AS DISCUSSED ON

PAGE 76 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR LIQUIDITY AND BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE $446.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, COMPARED WITH $391.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE INCREASE REFLECTED GREATER OVERALL LENDING ACTIVITY. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

FIRMS ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE

INSTRUMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED UPON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $238.7 BILLION AND $212.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNAL PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES.

THERE IS NO COMMON DEFINITION OF EMERGING MARKETS BUT THE FIRM GENERALLY, THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY, INCLUDES IN ITS DEFINITION THOSE COUNTRIES WHOSE SOVEREIGN DEBT RATINGS ARE EQUIVALENT TO A+ OR LOWER. EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY INCLUDE ALL

CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING COUNTRY EXPOSURES, THE FIRM USES STRESS TESTS TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE RISK OF EXTREME LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SOVEREIGN

CRISES.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE TOP FIVE EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRIES. THE SELECTION OF COUNTRIES IS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRMS LARGEST TOTAL EXPOSURES

BY COUNTRY AND NOT THE FIRMS VIEW OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIALLY ADVERSE CREDIT CONDITIONS. EXPOSURE IS REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR

COLLATERAL AND FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (E.G., GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES; OUTSTANDINGS SUPPORTED BY A GUARANTOR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OR BACKED BY COLLATERAL HELD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE

ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE HEDGES AND OTHER SHORT CREDIT OR EQUITY TRADING POSITIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE TABLE BELOW. TOTAL EXPOSURE INCLUDES EXPOSURE TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES IN A

COUNTRY.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, EDUCATION LOANS AND BUSINESS BANKING

LOANS, AND REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF DIVERSIFICATION FROM BOTH A PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS SERVING THE PRIME CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. RFS OFFERS HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT AND MORTGAGE LOANS WITH INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT

OPTIONS TO PREDOMINANTLY PRIME BORROWERS; THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS IN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS THAT RESULT IN NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION.

THE DOMESTIC CONSUMER CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT IN 2007 WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE DETERIORATION IN VALUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, AVERAGE HOME PRICES DECLINED ON A NATIONAL BASIS, WITH MANY SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE MARKETS RECORDING

DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECLINES IN AVERAGE HOME PRICES. THE NEGATIVE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT HAS ALSO HAD AN EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER CONSUMER CREDIT ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING AUTO LOANS AND CREDIT CARD LOANS. GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

THAT HAVE SEEN THE MOST MATERIAL DECLINES IN HOME PRICES HAVE EXHIBITED HIGHER DELINQUENCY AND LOSSES ACROSS THE CONSUMER CREDIT PRODUCT SPECTRUM.

SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TIGHTEN CREDIT UNDERWRITING AND

LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE LENDING. MAXIMUM LOAN-TO-VALUE AND DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS HAVE BEEN REDUCED, MINIMUM REQUIRED CREDIT RISK SCORES FOR LOAN QUALIFICATION HAVE BEEN INCREASED AND COLLATERAL VALUATION

METHODS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED. THESE ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS OF RISK LAYERED LOANS, AND IMPROVED ALIGNMENT OF LOAN PRICING WITH THE EMBEDDED RISK.

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOAN SERVICING POLICIES AND ACTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN ENHANCED. DELINQUENCY MANAGEMENT, LOSS MITIGATION, AND ASSET DISPOSITION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED,

WHILE COLLECTION INTENSITY, EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT, DEBT RESTRUCTURING, AND OTHER SIMILAR PRACTICES HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LOSS EXPOSURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRM

REGULARLY EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC RETURNS AND MAKES AN INITIAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER NEW ORIGINATIONS WILL BE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT OR SOLD WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE EXPECTED

ECONOMIC RETURNS OF PREVIOUSLY ORIGINATED LOANS UNDER PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR DESIGNATION AS HELD-FOR-SALE OR HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO BE APPROPRIATE. WHEN THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT A CHANGE IN THIS DESIGNATION

IS APPROPRIATE, THE LOANS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2007, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, THE FIRM DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ALL NEW ORIGINATIONS OF SUBPRIME

MORTGAGE LOANS, AS WELL AS SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED HELD-FOR-SALE. IN ADDITION, ALL NEW PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN

DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT. PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS 159 AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES WITHIN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO.

HOME EQUITY.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, WERE $94.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $9.1 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2006. THE CHANGE IN THE PORTFOLIO FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, REFLECTED ORGANIC GROWTH. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NET

INCREASES OF $1.0 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, AS RISK LAYERED LOANS, CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES AND SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NONPERFORMING ASSETS

AND ESTIMATED LOSSES, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO RECENTLY ORIGINATED HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE LOANS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN HOUSING PRICES. THE DECLINE IN HOUSING PRICES AND THE SECOND LIEN POSITION FOR

THESE TYPES OF LOANS RESULTS IN MINIMAL PROCEEDS UPON FORECLOSURE, INCREASING THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES. ALTHOUGH SUBPRIME HOME EQUITY LOANS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HOME EQUITY LOAN BALANCE, THE ORIGINATION OF SUBPRIME HOME EQUITY

LOANS WAS DISCONTINUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION, LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO BE INTENSIFIED, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED AND PRICING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO REFLECT ELEVATED RISKS RELATED TO THE

HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MORTGAGE.

PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS PRIME MORTGAGES, BOTH FIXED-RATE AND ADJUSTABLE-RATE, WERE ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL. PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS

ORIGINATED INTO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF ADJUSTABLE-RATE PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO RETAIN RATHER THAN SELL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND NEW ORIGINATIONS OF PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES, BOTH FIXED-RATE AND ADJUSTABLE-RATE PRODUCTS ARE NOW BEING ORIGINATED INTO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. MORTGAGES, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY ARE ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT

TO SELL OR HOLD-FOR-INVESTMENT, ARE UNDERWRITTEN TO THE SAME STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO THE RESPECTIVE TYPE OF MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE $56.0 BILLION, REFLECTING A $3.6 BILLION DECREASE FROM YEAR-END 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION TO TRADING ASSETS FOR PRIME MORTGAGES ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL AND ELECTED TO BE FAIR

VALUED UNDER SFAS 159 OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE DECISION TO RETAIN RATHER THAN SELL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND NEW ORIGINATIONS OF PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, MORTGAGE LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED $15.5 BILLION OF SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, REPRESENTING 28% OF THE TOTAL MORTGAGE LOAN BALANCE. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR MORTGAGE LOANS INCLUDED $166 MILLION

IN INCREASES TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, AS HOUSING PRICE DECLINES IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASES IN NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR

THE SUBPRIME PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ALSO REFLECTS THE DECISION TO RETAIN RATHER THAN SELL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS. LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN INTENSIFIED, PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

CONTINUE TO BE TIGHTENED TO REFLECT MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATION OF ELEVATED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE SUBPRIME MARKET SEGMENT. NONPERFORMING ASSETS HAVE ALSO INCREASED IN THE PRIME PRODUCT SEGMENT. BORROWERS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIVATE

MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN TO VALUE RATIOS. RECOVERIES ON THESE INSURANCE POLICIES OFFSET CREDIT LOSSES ON THESE LOANS TO THE EXTENT FORECLOSURE PROCEEDS ARE GREATER THAN 80% OF THE LOAN TO VALUE RATIO AT THE TIME OF

ORIGINATION. ADDITIONAL HOUSING PRICE DECLINES COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES FOR WHICH PROCEEDS ARE LESS THAN 80% OF THE ORIGINAL LOAN TO VALUE RATIO, RESULTING IN INCREASED LOSSES FOR THIS PRODUCT SEGMENT.

AUTO LOANS AND LEASES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES OF $42.4 BILLION INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM YEAR-END 2006. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO WAS INCREASED DURING 2007, REFLECTING AN

INCREASE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FROM LOW PRIOR-YEAR LEVELS AND DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

ALL OTHER LOANS

ALL OTHER LOANS PRIMARILY INCLUDE BUSINESS BANKING LOANS (WHICH ARE HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN GUARANTEES), EDUCATION LOANS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOANS

AND OTHER SECURED AND UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, OTHER LOANS, INCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, OF $28.7 BILLION WERE UP $1.6 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2006, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ORGANIC GROWTH IN BUSINESS BANKING LOANS.

CREDIT CARD

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES ITS CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED

BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS THROUGH SECURITIZATION. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES WERE $157.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, AN INCREASE OF $4.2

BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2006, REFLECTING ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO.

THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE INCREASED TO 3.68% FOR 2007, FROM 3.33% IN 2006.

THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN 2006. THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATE INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 3.48% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, FROM 3.13% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS WAS INCREASED

DUE TO HIGHER ESTIMATED NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A WELL-SEASONED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS

INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING LOSSES WHERE THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM, AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. THE ALLOWANCE IS REVIEWED RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT

PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND IS ADJUSTED IF, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES ARE WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC AND

A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 9697 AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 138139 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE

APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR FOR WHICH THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY DETERMINED).

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED $2.3 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE INCREASED $1.5 BILLION AND $779 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PORTION OF THE ALLOWANCE

INCLUDED INCREASES OF $1.3 BILLION AND $215 MILLION IN RFS AND CS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE PORTION OF THE ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN GROWTH IN THE IB AND CB.

EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTED 1.88% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, COMPARED WITH 1.70% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT, MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE COMPONENTS ARE

COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN. THIS ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS $850 MILLION AND $524 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE REFLECTED GROWTH IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND UPDATES TO INPUTS USED IN THE CALCULATION.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE REPORTED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE PAGE 33 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCLUDES CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE INCREASE IN THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES LARGELY RELATED TO HOME EQUITY LOANS, HIGHER CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFFS IN THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. THE

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES WAS DUE TO THE WEAKENING CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS GROWTH IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO. THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM A LOWER LEVEL OF CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH REFLECTED A LOWER LEVEL

OF LOSSES FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED, AND CONTROLLED BY MARKET RISK, A CORPORATE RISK GOVERNANCE FUNCTION INDEPENDENT OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS. MARKET RISK SEEKS TO

FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND MAKE THE FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER AND PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF BUSINESS SEGMENT MARKET RISK



DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS



PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK

IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

MARKET RISK WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND TO DEFINE AND

MONITOR MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF MARKET RISKS WITHIN THEIR UNITS. RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM TRADING

PERSONNEL AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK EXPOSURES THAT THE BUSINESS TAKES. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT FOR MARKET RISK ARISING FROM THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MARKET RISK IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING EXPOSURES WHICH

MAY NOT BE LARGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BUT WHICH MAY BE LARGE FOR THE FIRM IN AGGREGATE. REGULAR MEETINGS ARE HELD BETWEEN MARKET RISK AND THE HEADS OF RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE ON RISK EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF

THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT FLOWS.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRADING AND NONTRADING RISK. TRADING

RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS THAT ARE HELD BY THE FIRM AS PART OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT OR UNIT, THE MAIN BUSINESS STRATEGY OF WHICH IS TO TRADE OR MAKE MARKETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK INCLUDES SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS HELD FOR LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, AND SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THESE

POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

TRADING RISK

FIXED INCOME RISK (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK), FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES

AND OTHER TRADING RISKS INVOLVE THE POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES, WHETHER ARISING FROM CLIENT ACTIVITIES OR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM.

NONTRADING RISK

NONTRADING RISK ARISES FROM EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS CORE BUSINESS

STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS THE FIRM UNDERTAKES TO RISK-MANAGE EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES CAN

RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFFBALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE LEVEL AND SHAPE OF MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES ALSO MAY CREATE

INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO

FLOATING-RATE INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND 3-MONTH LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE FIRMS PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT IMPACT PRICING AND BALANCES.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS WELL AS OPTION AND BASIS RISK. OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY

ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

RISK

MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN

REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES





NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT VALUES, OPTION

SENSITIVITIES, MARKET VALUES, POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY LINE OF BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR MONITORING

LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND TACTICAL CONTROL.

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN

CHASES PRIMARY STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, VAR, ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED

FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES, MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS, AND AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. VAR PROVIDES RISK TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT. EACH BUSINESS DAY THE FIRM

UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES BOTH ITS TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING RISKS. VAR FOR NONTRADING RISK MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE EXPOSURES RELATED TO THESE RISKS; HOWEVER, FOR

SUCH RISKS, VAR IS NOT A MEASURE OF REPORTED REVENUE SINCE NONTRADING ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH NET INCOME.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM

USES HISTORICAL SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS AND PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE WAY. THIS APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES. THE SIMULATION IS BASED UPON

DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR USING A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY, WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY

VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS, OR ABOUT TWO TO THREE TIMES A YEAR.

(C)

AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END VARS WERE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF THEIR MARKET RISK COMPONENTS, WHICH WAS DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION

EFFECT REFLECTED THE FACT THAT THE RISKS WERE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES.

(D)

DESIGNATED AS NOT MEANINGFUL (NM) BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DIFFERENT RISK COMPONENTS, AND HENCE IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A PORTFOLIO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

IBS AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR WAS $106 MILLION FOR 2007, COMPARED WITH $88 MILLION FOR 2006. AVERAGE VAR WAS HIGHER DURING 2007 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN MARKET VOLATILITY AS WELL AS INCREASED RISK POSITIONS, MOST NOTABLY IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS. THESE CHANGES ALSO LED TO AN INCREASE IN PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION, AS AVERAGE TRADING VAR DIVERSIFICATION

INCREASED TO $77 MILLION DURING 2007, FROM $70 MILLION DURING 2006. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

VAR BACK-TESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY

BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE LESS PRI-

VATE EQUITY GAINS/LOSSES PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME,

BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE. THE DAILY IB MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES ON HELD-FOR-SALE FUNDED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS AND FROM DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA). THE

FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISKRELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR IB TRADING BUSINESSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE CHART SHOWS THAT IB POSTED MARKET RISKRELATED GAINS ON 215 OUT OF 261 DAYS IN THIS

PERIOD, WITH 53 DAYS EXCEEDING $100 MILLION. THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH IB EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 46 DAYS, WITH NO LOSS

GREATER THAN $225 MILLION. DURING 2007, LOSSES EXCEEDED THE VAR MEASURE ON EIGHT DAYS DUE TO THE HIGH MARKET VOLATILITY EXPERIENCED DURING THE YEAR. NO LOSSES EXCEEDED VAR MEASURE DURING 2006.

THE FIRM DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF DVA TAKEN ON DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM IN ITS TRADING VAR. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

LOSS

ADVISORIES AND DRAWDOWNS

LOSS ADVISORIES AND DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS AND ARE USED TO

INITIATE DISCUSSION OF REMEDIES.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR

REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS FOR BOTH ITS TRADING AND ITS

NONTRADING ACTIVITIES AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN SIGNIFICANTLY, EQUITY PRICES DECLINE AND INTEREST RATES RISE IN THE MAJOR CURRENCIES. ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS FOCUS ON THE RISKS PREDOMINANT IN

INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND INCLUDE SCENARIOS THAT FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE MOVES IN COMPLEX PORTFOLIOS. PERIODICALLY, SCENARIOS ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. ALONG

WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AND STRESS LOSSES ARE MONITORED AGAINST LIMITS. STRESS TESTING IS ALSO UTILIZED IN

ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MEASUREMENT, AS WELL AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION. STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS ARE PROVIDED EACH MONTH TO THE FIRMS SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO HELP

THEM BETTER MEASURE AND MANAGE RISKS AND TO UNDERSTAND EVENT RISK-SENSITIVE POSITIONS.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST

RATE EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET INCOME ALSO IS IMPORTANT. INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE NON-TRADING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET POSITIONS. THE

FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NII FROM ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND HIGHLIGHT

EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS THE RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES

AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK ALSO CAN RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THE FIRM

HAS THE ABILITY TO LEND AT FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED UPON THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES WITHOUT A

CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES. CONVERSELY, HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS ALSO ARE REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE,

NONPARALLEL RATE SHIFTS AND SEVERE INTEREST RATE SHOCKS ON SELECTED KEY RATES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS-AT-RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES.

THE PRIMARY CHANGE IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006, REFLECTS INCREASED PREPAYMENTS ON LOANS AND SECURITIES

DUE TO LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO BOTH RISING AND FALLING RATES. THE FIRMS RISK TO RISING RATES IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF INCREASED FUNDING COSTS. IN CONTRAST, THE EXPOSURE TO FALLING RATES IS THE RESULT OF HIGHER

ANTICIPATED LEVELS OF LOAN AND SECURITIES PREPAYMENTS.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS

A POTENTIAL TAX CHANGE, AND ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITIES OF LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH EVENTS. THIS INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO THE FIRMS RIFLE DATABASE. TRADING MANAGEMENT HAS ACCESS TO RIFLE, THEREBY PERMITTING THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER

EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT

THE FIRMS RISK APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRENDS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRMS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING RISK LIMITS AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND

STRESS. SIMILARLY, LINE-OF-BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LOSS ADVISORIES, NON-STATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS, AGAINST

WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED. LIMIT BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS SEGMENT IS REQUIRED EITHER TO REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS OR CONSULT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATE

ACTION.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

THE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ALSO PERFORMS

PERIODIC REVIEWS AS NECESSARY OF BOTH BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL THEIR MARKET RISK. STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED,

AND SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED UPON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. THE MODEL RISK GROUP, INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESSES AND MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, INCLUDING

WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SUITABILITY AND CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES, CONSISTENCY OF THE TREATMENT WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR

PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED OF NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY

ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY AND WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE MODELS

ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED UPON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 9698 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK

REPORTING

NONSTATISTICAL EXPOSURES, VALUE-AT-RISK, LOSS ADVISORIES AND LIMIT EXCESSES ARE REPORTED DAILY FOR EACH TRADING AND NONTRADING BUSINESS. MARKET RISK

EXPOSURE TRENDS, VALUE-AT-RISK TRENDS, PROFIT AND LOSS CHANGES, AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS ARE REPORTED WEEKLY. STRESS-TEST RESULTS ARE REPORTED MONTHLY TO BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM

MAKES DIRECT PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM HOLDING PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK OF POSITIONS HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS

APPROACH TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING TARGET LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND INTENDED

TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIO. AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WERE $7.2 BILLION AND $6.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $390 MILLION AND $587 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTED PUBLICLY TRADED POSITIONS. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, SEE PAGE 60 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM

INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR

OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL

ENVIRONMENT. THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH

IT IS SUBJECT. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO

MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION,

ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PHOENIX, AN

INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK

DATA BY ENABLING RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER, THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.

RISK

IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL

LOSSES. ALL BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE FIRMS STANDARD SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS

SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL

RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE-OF-BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE BUSINESSES.

WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED ENABLES THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST AGAINST SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE FIRM IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE

OPERATIONAL RISK DATA EXCHANGE, A NOT-FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING OPERATIONAL LOSS DATA, SHARING

DATA IN AN ANONYMOUS FORM AND BENCHMARKING RESULTS BACK TO MEMBERS. SUCH

INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTS THE FIRMS ONGOING OPERATIONAL RISK ANALYSIS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF

BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE

FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT

UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING. AUDIT PARTNERS WITH BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND

MEMBERS OF THE CONTROL COMMUNITY IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK AND REVIEWS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS UNIT AUDITS.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT

MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE AMONG MANY CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A REPUTATION

FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION ALWAYS HAS BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL

RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, MAINTAINING ADHERENCE TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE,

WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM, AND REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK REVIEW COMMITTEES, WHICH REVIEW CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED

FINANCE TRANSACTIONS, THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT ADVERSELY THE FIRMS REPUTATION. THESE REGIONAL COMMITTEES, WHOSE MEMBERS ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESS AND CONTROL FUNCTION IN THE REGION, FOCUS ON THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS

TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR OTHERS.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS INCLUDE IN THEIR MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR

BUSINESSES THAT MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS WITH THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS

RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT, INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION; DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY THE FIRM THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH

FIDUCIARY DUTIES. IN THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY

OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FIRMS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUATION

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED

CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF ITS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS THE

FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 138139 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES JUDGMENT IN ESTABLISHING THE INPUTS USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCES. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO

EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND TO REFINE LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS. WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO

FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT,

THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND

INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM

APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES. MANY

FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO WHETHER THE LOSS ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE OVER THE ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE

OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE, AS WELL AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL DATA SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC LOAN PORT-

FOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF

DIFFERENT INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE

LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS BY CREATING ESTIMATED RANGES USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN

DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

AS

NOTED ON PAGE 77 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRMS WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED TO A LOAN. ASSUMING A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN THE FIRMS INTERNAL RISK RATINGS FOR ITS ENTIRE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE FOR ALL WHOLESALE

LOANS WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME IS REMOTE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE IMPACT OF RISK RATINGS ON THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR WHOLESALE LOANS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY MANAGEMENTS

EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION IN RISK RATINGS. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATINGS OF ITS LOANS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RISK RATINGS CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO WHOLESALE LOANS ARE APPROPRIATE.

CONSUMER LOANS

FOR CONSUMER LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS CALCULATED FOR

INDIVIDUAL POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS UTILIZING A METHODOLOGY THAT IS INTENDED TO ESTIMATE LOSSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED, BUT ARE NOT YET APPARENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE ALLOWANCE IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT BUREAU SCORES, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ESTIMATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

THE ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED BY

APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORY

USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE CHARGE-OFFS. MANAGEMENT UTILIZES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS

ESTIMATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND IS

ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT WITHIN ESTIMATED RANGES IN DETERMINING THIS ADJUSTMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE

POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT RELATED TO UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AFS SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY $635.5 BILLION OF THE FIRMS

ASSETS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED

UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS. THE FIRM ENSURES THAT ALL APPLICABLE INPUTS ARE APPROPRIATELY CALIBRATED TO MARKET DATA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD

CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT

CURVES. IN ADDITION TO MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE

TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY. FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING CREDIT (COUNTERPARTIES AND THE FIRMS), LIQUIDITY, AND INPUT PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY ARE INCLUDED, AS APPROPRIATE, TO THE MODEL VALUE TO ARRIVE AT A FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 4 AND NOTE 5 ON PAGES 111118 AND 119121, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE

FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 157, WHICH ESTABLISHED A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. AN INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT. THEREFORE, FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 AND 2 OF THE HIERARCHY WHERE INPUTS ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THERE IS LESS JUDGMENT APPLIED IN ARRIVING AT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FOR INSTRUMENTS

CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT. IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3 MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF

OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS. FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHERE RELEVANT. THE

JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE FIRMS ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS BY LEVEL WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

INCLUDES LEVEL 3 ASSETS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN LOANS (INCLUDING PURCHASED NON-PERFORMING LOANS, LEVERAGED LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS, AND SUBPRIME LOANS); CERTAIN

RESIDUAL OR RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS AND LESS LIQUID SECURITIES INCLUDING CERTAIN MBS ASSETS; CERTAIN COMPLEX AND STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, MSRS, AND NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY.

THE FIRM REVIEWS AND UPDATES THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CLASSIFICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES FROM ONE QUARTER TO THE NEXT RELATED TO THE OBSERVABILITY OF INPUTS TO A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT MAY RESULT IN A RECLASSIFICATION BETWEEN

HIERARCHY LEVELS.

LEVEL 3 ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE) WERE 5% OF TOTAL FIRM ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THESE ASSETS

INCREASED DURING 2007 PRINCIPALLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHEN LIQUIDITY IN MORTGAGES AND OTHER CREDIT PRODUCTS FELL

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

DRAMATICALLY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LEVERAGED LOAN BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3 AS THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO SYNDICATE THIS RISK TO THIRD PARTIES BECAME

LIMITED BY THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 2 TO LEVEL 3 DURING 2007. THESE TRANSFERS WERE PRINCIPALLY FOR INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE MORTGAGE MARKET WHERE INPUTS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR VALUATION BECAME

UNOBSERVABLE DURING THE YEAR. SUBPRIME AND ALT-A WHOLE LOANS, SUBPRIME HOME EQUITY SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED MEZZANINE LOANS AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES CONSTITUTED THE MAJORITY OF THE AFFECTED

INSTRUMENTS, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN LIQUIDITY IN THESE INSTRUMENTS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2007, AS NEW ISSUE ACTIVITY WAS NONEXISTENT AND INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR THESE ASSETS.

TO ENSURE THAT FAIR VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAIR VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW GROUP

REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS WITHIN THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK TAKING FUNCTIONS, ENSURES

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS ARE USED FOR VALUATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ON PRICING

IS PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS, AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL

CASH SETTLEMENT; AND DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, ARE BASED UPON ESTABLISHED

POLICIES AND ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO CONFIRM THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE OR LESS

TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS

RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 111118 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO

REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE FIRM TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, AND MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR

CONDUCTING AN INTERIM TEST. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING-UNIT LEVEL (WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 34 ON PAGES 175177 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY WHICH

IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST IS A COMPARISON, AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING

VALUE, THEN THE SECOND PART OF THE TEST IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL IS CALCULATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL RECORDED IN THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL RECORDS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL, THEN THE FIRM WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE, WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE

AGAINST NET INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS BASED UPON EACH REPORTING UNITS INTERNAL

FORECASTS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE FIRMS REPORTING UNITS CAN IMPACT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. TO ASSESS

THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, THE FIRM ALSO ANALYZES MARKET-BASED TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES, WHERE AVAILABLE. THESE TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED TO ASSESS THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, AS OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION IS GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE.

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN

COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF ITS ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE

ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS.

DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH

THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED UPON AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS. IN SOME CASES, THE FIRMS INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADJUDICATION BY THE COURT SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE PRESENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FOR THE YEARS 2003, 2004 AND 2005. THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS OF HERITAGE BANK ONE CORPORATION,

WHICH MERGED WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE ON JULY 1, 2004, ARE UNDER EXAMINATION FOR THE YEARS 2000 THROUGH 2003, AND FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2004, THROUGH JULY 1, 2004. BOTH EXAMINATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE IN THE LATTER PART

OF 2008. THE IRS AUDIT OF THE 2006 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN HAS NOT YET COMMENCED. CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS ARE PENDING WITH THE IRS RELATING TO PRIOR EXAMINATION PERIODS, FOR JPMORGAN CHASE FOR THE YEARS 2001 AND 2002, AND FOR

BANK ONE AND ITS PREDECESSOR ENTITIES FOR VARIOUS PERIODS FROM 1996 THROUGH 1999. FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2001, REFUND CLAIMS RELATING TO INCOME AND CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS, AND TO TAX ATTRIBUTE CARRYBACKS, FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS PREDECESSOR ENTITIES,

INCLUDING BANK ONE, EITHER HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE FILED. ALSO, INTEREST RATE SWAP VALUATIONS BY A BANK ONE PREDECESSOR ENTITY FOR THE YEARS 1990 THROUGH 1993 ARE, AND HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION IN BOTH THE TAX COURT AND THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASES

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT OCCURS.

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS 109. FIN 48 ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN, AND ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN

INTERIM PERIODS AND DISCLOSURE. THE FIRM ADOPTED AND APPLIED FIN 48 UNDER THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS TO ALL OF ITS INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2007, RESULTING IN A $436 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO

RETAINED EARNINGS, A REDUCTION IN GOODWILL OF $113 MILLION AND A $549 MILLION DECREASE IN THE LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF FIN 48, SEE NOTE 26 ON PAGE 164 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CHANGES IN TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A LEVERAGED LEASE

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 13-2. FSP FAS 13-2 REQUIRES THE RECALCULATION OF RETURNS ON LEVERAGED LEASES IF THERE IS A CHANGE OR PROJECTED CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RELATING TO INCOME TAXES GENERATED BY A

LEVERAGED LEASE. THE FIRM ADOPTED FSP FAS 13-2 AT THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2007. IMPLEMENTATION OF FSP FAS 13-2 DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ADOPTION OF SFAS 157

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS 157, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. SFAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. JPMORGAN CHASE CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION FOR SFAS 157 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007 AND RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $287 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RELEASE OF PROFIT PREVIOUSLY

DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 PRIMARILY AFFECTED IB AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES 111118 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  ADOPTION OF SFAS 159

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 159, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. SFAS 159 PROVIDES THE OPTION

TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENT FOR SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENTS AND WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION FOR SFAS 159 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, AND

AS A RESULT, IT RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $199 MILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF SFAS 159, SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGE 119121 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DERIVATIVES NETTING  AMENDMENT OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 39

IN APRIL 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN 39-1, WHICH PERMITS OFFSETTING OF CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES OR PAYABLES WITH NET DERIVATIVE POSITIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FIRM ADOPTED FSP FIN 39-1 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008. THE FSP DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

IN JUNE 2007, THE AICPA ISSUED SOP 07-1. SOP 07-1 PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ENTITY IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AICPA AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING GUIDE

INVESTMENT

COMPANIES

(THE GUIDE), AND THEREFORE QUALIFIES TO USE THE GUIDES SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (REFERRED TO AS INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING). ADDITIONALLY, SOP 07-1 PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHETHER

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING SHOULD BE RETAINED BY A PARENT COMPANY IN CONSOLIDATION OR BY AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTOR IN AN INVESTMENT. IN MAY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN 46(R)-7, WHICH AMENDS FIN 46R TO PERMANENTLY EXEMPT ENTITIES WITHIN THE

SCOPE OF THE GUIDE FROM APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46R TO THEIR INVESTMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB AGREED TO AN INDEFINITE DELAY OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SOP 07-1 IN ORDER TO ADDRESS IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DELAYS FSP FIN

46(R)-7 AS WELL FOR THOSE COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE FIRM, THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED SOP 07-1.

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF DIVIDENDS ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF 06-11, WHICH MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY FOR DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2007. EITF 06-11 REQUIRES THAT REALIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON EQUITY-CLASSIFIED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS SHOULD BE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL

AND INCLUDED IN THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO ABSORB TAX DEFICIENCIES ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF EITF 06-11, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE THESE TAX BENEFITS AS PART OF THIS POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. THE

FIRM ADOPTED EITF 06-11 ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSENSUS DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED SAB

109, WHICH REVISES AND RESCINDS PORTIONS OF SAB 105, APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO LOAN COMMITMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, SAB 109 STATES THAT THE EXPECTED NET FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ASSOCIATED SERVICING OF THE LOAN SHOULD BE

INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF ALL WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 109 ARE APPLICABLE TO WRITTEN LOAN COMMITMENTS ISSUED OR MODIFIED BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2008. JPMORGAN

CHASE DOES NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING SAB 109 TO BE MATERIAL.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS / NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ON DECEMBER 4, 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 141R AND SFAS 160, WHICH AMEND THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AS WELL AS NONCONTROLLING (I.E.,

MINORITY) INTERESTS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT SFAS 141R AND SFAS 160 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, SFAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT CLOSE ON OR AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2009. SFAS 160 IS EFFECTIVE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRMS

ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE FIRM ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE

FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY

NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE

POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT

HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE FRAMEWORK IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE COSO CRITERIA.

BASED

UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT,

THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

107

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.), WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL

TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 34 ON PAGES 175177 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP). ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES

CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY BANK REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM

TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE MOST USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IS THE OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTERESTS OF THE ENTITY. HOWEVER, A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST ALSO

MAY BE DEEMED TO EXIST WITH RESPECT TO ENTITIES, SUCH AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE CONTROLLING VOTING INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED

LIFE AND NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED

ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPES ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING

THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE) FRAMEWORK UNDER

SFAS 140 AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46R. THE APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY. THE QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY TRANSFERS

(SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA DEFINED IN SFAS 140. THESE CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE

FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT

EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THE

ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. ENTITIES MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OR TO CAUSE THE ENTITY TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA.

THE FIRM PRIMARILY FOLLOWS THE QSPE MODEL FOR SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, AND CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND EDUCATION LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHEN AN SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA, CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46R. UNDER FIN 46R, A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT: (1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY

INVESTMENT AT RISK TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES; (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE ENTITYS

OPERATIONS; AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE ENTITYS LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE ENTITYS RETURNS.

FIN 46R REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E., A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IF THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR

BOTH. THIS PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, THE FIRM THOROUGHLY EVALUATES THE VIES DESIGN, CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. WHEN THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY CANNOT

BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPUTES AND ALLOCATES EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS TO VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE ALLOCATION OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED

UPON THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF EACH VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE. THE FIRM RECONSIDERS WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR AS REQUIRED BY FIN 46R. FOR FURTHER DETAILS,

SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES 146154 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ALL RETAINED INTERESTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND NONCONSOLIDATED VIES ARE

REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO

BE VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES UNDER FIN 46R IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS ARE EITHER ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING OR AT FAIR VALUE IF ELECTED UNDER SFAS 159

(FAIR VALUE OPTION). THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE

NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USE

OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND OF DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES. FOR DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM, SEE PAGES 9698 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN (I.E., NON-U.S.) CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH

FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE

4  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 157 (FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS), WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING

AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE FIRM CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION FOR SFAS 157 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. SFAS 157.



DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE, AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE;



ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED UPON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE;



NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE IN EITF 02-3, WHICH REQUIRED THE DEFERRAL OF PROFIT AT INCEPTION OF A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF

OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING THE VALUATION TECHNIQUE;



ELIMINATES LARGE POSITION DISCOUNTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS QUOTED IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE FIRMS CREDIT-WORTHINESS WHEN VALUING

LIABILITIES; AND



EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM

ALSO CHOSE EARLY ADOPTION FOR SFAS 159 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. SFAS 159 PROVIDES AN OPTION TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS AN ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENT FOR SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENTS AND WRITTEN LOAN

COMMITMENTS NOT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM ELECTED FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT PREVIOUSLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGES 119121 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. SUCH VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WERE APPLIED TO

ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159 OR PREVIOUSLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE, AS INPUTS, MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. IN ADDITION TO

MARKET INFORMATION, MODELS ALSO INCORPORATE TRANSACTION DETAILS, SUCH AS MATURITY. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

QUALITY, THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS THAT ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (CVA) ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES

OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED

USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. MARKET PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO AN AA

CREDIT RATING; THUS, ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. THEREFORE, AN ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE.



DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (DVA) ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THIS ADJUSTMENT

WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRMS VALUATIONS COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2007, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 157. THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE ADJUSTMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH CVA AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED

THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP MARKET.



LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS

ACTIVE) MARKETS OR TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS (LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT TAKEN FOR POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY). THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF

UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION BASED UPON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY OF THE MARKET IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT TRADES AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE FIRM MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY

ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK COMPONENT OF THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. COSTS TO EXIT LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A POSITION DOWN TO A NON-CONCENTRATED LEVEL.



UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS 

THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THESE POSITIONS ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS WHERE PARAMETERS SUCH AS CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE

UNOBSERVABLE. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO MITIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR AND REVISION IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE MARKET PRICE PROVIDED BY THE MODEL.

THE FIRM HAS NUMEROUS CONTROLS IN PLACE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAIR VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE. AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW GROUP REVIEWS THE FIRMS VALUATION MODELS AND

APPROVES THEM FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. ALL VALUATION MODELS WITHIN THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO THIS REVIEW PROCESS. A PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, INDEPENDENT FROM THE RISK TAKING FUNCTION, ENSURES OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS

ARE USED FOR VALUATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL PARAMETER RISK FOR WHICH OBSERVABLE MARKET LEVELS DO NOT EXIST, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

ON PRICING IS PERFORMED. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INCLUDES DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS, AND BENCHMARKING

VALUATIONS, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR

PRODUCTS; VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT; AND DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION OF RECORDED GAINS

AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE ALSO DETERMINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION GROUP, ARE BASED UPON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME. ANY CHANGES TO THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO CONFIRM THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED. AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE OR LESS TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO REFINE ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE,

WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT

ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

SFAS 157

ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE

DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.



LEVEL 2  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



LEVEL 3  INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE

VALUATION HIERARCHY.

ASSETS

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE

AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS)

TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESALE AGREEMENTS, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE

FEATURES OF THE RESALE AGREEMENT AND ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. AS THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON READILY OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, SUCH RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE

GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF CORPORATE LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS CALCULATED USING OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION INCLUDING PRICING FROM ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR

BROKER QUOTATIONS WHERE AVAILABLE. WHERE PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC LOAN, THE VALUATION IS GENERALLY BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS LOANS AND BONDS. THESE COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS SHARE

CHARACTERISTICS THAT TYPICALLY INCLUDE INDUSTRY, RATING, CAPITAL STRUCTURE, SENIORITY, AND CONSIDERATION OF COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PREVAILING MARKET SPREADS FOR CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK, ARE ALSO

CONSIDERED IN THE VALUATION PROCESS.

FOR CERTAIN LOANS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SECURITIZED, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED

BASED UPON OBSERVABLE PRICING OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WITH SIMILAR COLLATERAL AND INCORPORATES ADJUSTMENTS (I.E., REDUCTIONS) TO THESE PRICES TO ACCOUNT FOR SECURITIZATION UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION, MARKET CONDITIONS AND

LIQUIDITY TO ARRIVE AT THE WHOLE LOAN PRICE. WHEN DATA FROM RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS IS AVAILABLE IT IS INCORPORATED AS APPROPRIATE. IF PARTICULAR LOANS ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED BECAUSE OF POOR BORROWER PERFORMANCE AND HENCE ARE NOT QUALIFIED

FOR SECURITIZATION, THEY ARE MARKED FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE WITH CONSIDERATION OF POTENTIAL LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS AND PROPERTY REPOSSESSION/LIQUIDATION INFORMATION, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE FIRMS LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED IN TRADING ASSETS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, ALTHOUGH SUBPRIME LOANS RESIDE IN LEVEL 3. LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORTED

WITHIN LOANS ARE PREDOMINANTLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE PRICING. THESE LOANS INCLUDE LEVERAGED LENDING FUNDED LOANS, HIGH-YIELD BRIDGE FINANCING AND PURCHASED NONPERFORMING LOANS.

SECURITIES

WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL 1 SECURITIES INCLUDED HIGHLY LIQUID GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITIES. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF SECURITIES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND

HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES WHICH WOULD GENERALLY BE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE THERE IS LIMITED ACTIVITY OR LESS TRANSPARENCY AROUND INPUTS TO THE VALUATION, SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3

OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE MAY REQUIRE BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT

AND RECOVERY RATES. FOR CASH COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOS), EXTERNAL PRICE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, CASH CDOS ARE VALUED USING MARKET-STANDARD MODELS, SUCH AS INTEX, TO MODEL THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL COMPOSITION

AND CASH FLOW STRUCTURE OF EACH DEAL; KEY INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE MARKET SPREADS DATA FOR EACH CREDIT RATING, COLLATERAL TYPE AND OTHER RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL FEATURES. ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON EXTERNAL PRICES OR SPREAD DATA, USING

CURRENT

112

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET

ASSUMPTIONS ON PREPAYMENTS AND DEFAULTS. FOR THOSE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WHERE THE EXTERNAL PRICE DATA IS NOT OBSERVABLE OR THE LIMITED AVAILABLE DATA IS OPAQUE, THE COLLATERAL PERFORMANCE IS MONITORED AND THE VALUE OF THE SECURITY IS REVIEWED

VERSUS THE ABX INDEX, AN INDEX OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES BACKED BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGES.

COMMODITIES

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE FOR COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICING AND DATA DERIVED FROM THE

MARKETS ON WHICH THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. MARKET PRICES MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR LIQUIDITY. THE FIRM ALSO HAS POSITIONS IN COMMODITY-BASED DERIVATIVES THAT CAN BE TRADED ON AN EXCHANGE OR OVER-THE-COUNTER. THE PRICING INPUTS TO THESE

DERIVATIVES INCLUDE FORWARD CURVES OF UNDERLYING COMMODITIES, BASIS CURVES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, AND OCCASIONALLY OTHER MODEL PARAMETERS. THE VALUATION OF THESE DERIVATIVES IS BASED UPON CALIBRATING TO MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS TO

INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION FROM SOURCES SUCH AS BROKERS AND DEALER CONSENSUS PRICING SERVICES. WHERE INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, THEY ARE BENCHMARKED TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BASED UPON HISTORIC AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS, THEN ADJUSTED FOR

UNCERTAINTY WHERE APPROPRIATE. THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY AND COMMODITIES-BASED DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES

EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. HOWEVER, FEW CLASSES OF

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE; THUS, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE

ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES. DEPENDING ON THE TYPES AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF DERIVATIVES, FAIR VALUE CAN BE MODELED USING A SERIES OF TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION

PRICING MODEL, SIMULATION MODELS OR A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS MODELS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. WHERE DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR SOME TIME, THE FIRM USES MODELS THAT ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THESE MODELS REFLECT THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND MARKET-BASED PARAMETERS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITY, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. FURTHER, MANY OF THESE MODELS DO NOT CONTAIN

A HIGH LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVITY AS THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN THE MODELS DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, AND INPUTS TO THE MODEL ARE READILY OBSERVABLE FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED MARKETS, AS IS THE CASE FOR PLAIN VANILLA INTEREST RATE SWAPS

AND OPTION CONTRACTS AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE VALUED BASED

UPON MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS AND THAT ARE NORMALLY TRADED LESS ACTIVELY, HAVE TRADE ACTIVITY THAT IS ONE WAY, AND/OR ARE TRADED IN LESS-DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. LEVEL

3 DERIVATIVES INCLUDE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, WHERE VALUATIONS ARE BENCHMARKED TO IMPLIED SPREADS FROM SIMILAR UNDERLYING LOANS IN THE CASH MARKET, AS WELL AS RELEVANT OBSERVABLE MARKET INDICES. IN ADDITION,

THE PREPAYMENT

AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ON THE

UNDERLYING LOANS ARE PRICED USING A COMBINATION OF HISTORICAL DATA, PRICES ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AND OTHER PREPAYMENT AND DEFAULT SCENARIOS AND ANALYSIS. OTHER COMPLEX PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THOSE SENSITIVE TO CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE

UNDERLYINGS, ALSO FALL WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY. FOR INSTANCE, THE CORRELATION SENSITIVITY IS MATERIAL TO THE OVERALL VALUATION OF OPTIONS ON BASKETS OF SINGLE NAME STOCKS; THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE TYPICALLY NOT OBSERVABLE DUE

TO THE CUSTOMIZED NATURE. CORRELATION FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS THESE ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED BASED ON AN OBSERVABLE BASKET OF STOCKS, THEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING EQUITIES.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MORTGAGE

SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE, OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. WHILE SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, THE PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICALLY ARE NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) MODELS.



FOR MSRS, THE FIRM USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION MODEL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO PROJECT MSR CASH FLOWS

OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES TO ESTIMATE AN EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE OAS MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, COSTS TO SERVICE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM REASSESSES AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE VALUATION INPUTS, MSRS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.



FOR CERTAIN RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS (SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS), A SINGLE INTEREST RATE PATH DCF MODEL IS USED AND GENERALLY INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON

PROJECTED FINANCE CHARGES RELATED TO THE SECURITIZED ASSETS, ESTIMATED NET CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAID TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS

VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS AND SUCH INTERESTS ARE THEREFORE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND

CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 AND NOTE 18 ON PAGES 154156 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE VALUATION OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, HELD

PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. AS SUCH, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ARE VALUED INITIALLY BASED UPON COST. EACH QUARTER, VALUATIONS ARE REVIEWED UTILIZING AVAILABLE MARKET DATA TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. SUCH MARKET DATA PRIMARILY INCLUDES OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRADING

MULTIPLES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES CONSIDERED COMPARABLE TO THE PRIVATE COMPANIES BEING VALUED. VALUATIONS ARE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUES, THE LACK OF LIQUIDITY INHERENT IN A NONPUBLIC INVESTMENT AND THE FACT THAT COMPARABLE PUBLIC

COMPANIES ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO THE COMPANIES BEING VALUED. SUCH VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMMITTED BUYER AND COMPLETION OF DUE DILIGENCE SIMILAR TO THAT PERFORMED IN AN ACTUAL NEGOTIATED SALE PROCESS, THERE MAY

BE COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT ARE NOT FULLY KNOWN THAT MAY AFFECT VALUE. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCING AND SALES TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES, CURRENT OPERATING

PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR INVESTMENT, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM APPLIES ITS VALUATION METHODOLOGY CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AND THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS

VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND ASSOCIATED VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLICLY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED THROUGH THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATELY HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS. PUBLICLY HELD

INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID MARKETS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET AT THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUE LESS ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL SALES RESTRICTIONS. DISCOUNTS FOR RESTRICTIONS ARE QUANTIFIED BY ANALYZING THE LENGTH OF THE RESTRICTION PERIOD AND THE

VOLATILITY OF THE EQUITY SECURITY. PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

LIABILITIES

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS)

TO

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY DERIVATIVE FEATURES AND ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY. AS THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE

PRIMARILY BASED UPON OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED

BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

THE FAIR VALUE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS HELD BY THE VIES. THE VALUATION OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM AS THE HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. AS THE INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON READILY OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, THE MAJORITY OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

DEPOSITS, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

INCLUDED WITHIN DEPOSITS, OTHER

BORROWED FUNDS AND LONG-TERM DEBT ARE STRUCTURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE FIRM THAT ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED NOTES, CASH FLOWS ARE EVALUATED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ANY

DERIVATIVE FEATURES AND ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITIES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION OF STRUCTURED NOTES INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM (I.E., THE DVA). WHERE THE

INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON READILY OBSERVABLE PRICING INFORMATION, THE STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, STRUCTURED NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDES A ROLLFORWARD OF THE BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 (INCLUDING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE), FOR FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY THE FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY. WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE

OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED

AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND

LOSSES IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO, THE FIRM RISK MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY; AS THESE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE TABLES DO NOT REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRMS

IN THE ABOVE TABLE, LOANS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS CARRIED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE; AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WITHIN THE LEVERAGED LENDING PORTFOLIO.

LEVEL 3 ASSETS ANALYSIS

LEVEL 3 ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE) WERE 5% OF TOTAL FIRM ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THESE ASSETS INCREASED DURING 2007 PRINCIPALLY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHEN LIQUIDITY IN MORTGAGES AND OTHER CREDIT PRODUCTS FELL DRAMATICALLY. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LEVERAGED LOAN BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3 AS THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO SYNDICATE THIS RISK TO THIRD PARTIES BECAME LIMITED BY THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 2 TO LEVEL 3 DURING

2007. THESE TRANSFERS WERE PRINCIPALLY FOR INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE MORTGAGE MARKET WHERE INPUTS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR VALUATION BECAME UNOBSERVABLE DURING THE YEAR. SUBPRIME AND ALT-A WHOLE LOANS, SUBPRIME HOME EQUITY SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED MEZZANINE LOANS AND CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS REFERENCED TO ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES CONSTITUTED THE MAJORITY OF THE AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN LIQUIDITY IN THESE INSTRUMENTS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS

OF 2007, AS NEW ISSUE ACTIVITY WAS NONEXISTENT AND INDEPENDENT PRICING INFORMATION WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR THESE ASSETS.

TRANSITION

IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, THE FIRM RECORDED THE FOLLOWING ON JANUARY 1, 2007.



A CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $287 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RELEASE OF PROFIT PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3;



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $166 MILLION ($103 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO THE INCORPORATION OF THE FIRMS CREDITWORTHINESS IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE; AND



AN INCREASE TO PRETAX INCOME OF $464 MILLION ($288 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO VALUATIONS OF NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, THE FIRM APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF EITF 02-3 TO ITS DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO. EITF 02-3 PRECLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF INITIAL TRADING PROFIT IN THE

ABSENCE OF: (A) QUOTED MARKET PRICES, (B) OBSERVABLE PRICES OF OTHER CURRENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR (C) OTHER OBSERVABLE DATA SUPPORTING A VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-3, THE FIRM RECOGNIZED THE DEFERRED PROFIT IN

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS (TYPICALLY STRAIGHT-LINE AMORTIZATION OVER THE LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS) AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECAME AVAILABLE.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 THE

FIRM DID NOT INCORPORATE AN ADJUSTMENT INTO THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. COMMENCING JANUARY 1, 2007, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 157, AN ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO THE

VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157, PRIVATELY HELD INVESTMENTS WERE

INITIALLY VALUED BASED UPON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATELY HELD INVESTMENTS WERE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. THE INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO

SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY PRIVATE EQUITY SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. THE INCREASE IN PRETAX INCOME RELATED TO NONPUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 WAS DUE TO THERE BEING SUFFICIENT

MARKET EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN FAIR VALUES USING THE SFAS 157 METHODOLOGY, ALTHOUGH THERE HAD NOT BEEN AN ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY MARKET TRANSACTION RELATED TO SUCH INVESTMENTS.

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107

SFAS 107 REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

THE METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUES. MANY BUT NOT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS

107 THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS 107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED

TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND DUE FROM

BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES, SECURITIES BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE, COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED,

SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E.,

DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE DOES NOT APPROXIMATE CARRYING VALUE

LOANS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LOANS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES

THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE FIRM CONSIDERS IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR THE FOLLOWING PORTFOLIOS OF LOANS.

WHOLESALE

FAIR VALUE FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS ESTIMATED, PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN

BONDS, UPON WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS.

CONSUMER



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS AND CONSUMER REAL ESTATE), FOR WHICH MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE, ARE

BASED UPON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET RATES ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER RISKS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A PARTICULAR ASSET CLASS.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED UPON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF

INTEREST RATE CHANGES, SINCE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ALREADY REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CREDIT RISK.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING TIME DEPOSITS ARE ESTIMATED BY DIS-

COUNTING CASH FLOWS USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE

MATURITY.

LONG-TERM DEBT RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM

DEBT, INCLUDING THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS NOR ARE THEY ACTIVELY TRADED. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES (WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, UPON WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS) AND LOAN

EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS). THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS CONSUMER

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED UPON THE PRIMARY MARKET PRICES TO ORIGINATE NEW COMMITMENTS. IT IS THE CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES THAT PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS BASIS, THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WAS A LIABILITY OF $1.9 BILLION AND $210 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

(D)

WHEN FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS WERE MADE, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE RECLASSIFIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (FOR EXAMPLE, WAREHOUSE LOANS WERE MOVED FROM LOANS TO TRADING ASSETS).

THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT FOR THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE LINE ITEM IN WHICH THEY WERE CLASSIFIED SUBSEQUENT TO THE FAIR VALUE ELECTION.

ELECTIONS

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE PRIMARY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS WERE MADE AND THE BASIS FOR

THOSE ELECTIONS.

LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

ON

JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ELECTED TO RECORD, AT FAIR VALUE, THE FOLLOWING.



LOANS AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE EXTENDED AS PART OF THE INVESTMENT BANKS PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THE TRANSITION AMOUNT RELATED TO THESE

LOANS INCLUDED A REVERSAL OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $56 MILLION.



CERTAIN LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE. THESE LOANS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THIS ELECTION ENABLED THE FIRM TO RECORD LOANS PURCHASED AS

PART OF THE INVESTMENT BANKS COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY AND PROPRIETARY ACTIVITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND DISCONTINUE SFAS 133 FAIR VALUE HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS FOR CERTAIN ORIGINATED LOANS.

BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM CHOSE TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS THE MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FOLLOWING LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED AFTER THAT DATE.

 LOANS PURCHASED OR ORIGINATED AS PART OF THE INVESTMENT BANKS SECURITIZATION WAREHOUSING ACTIVITIES



PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED WITH THE INTENT TO SELL WITHIN RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES (RFS)

WAREHOUSE LOANS ELECTED TO BE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING WAREHOUSE LOANS, SEE

NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ELECTION TO FAIR VALUE THE ABOVE LOANS DID NOT INCLUDE LOANS WITHIN THESE PORTFOLIOS THAT EXISTED ON

JANUARY 1, 2007, BASED UPON THE SHORT HOLDING PERIOD OF THE LOANS AND/OR THE NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT OF THE ELECTIONS.

BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, THE

FIRM ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR NEWLY ORIGINATED BRIDGE FINANCING ACTIVITY IN THE INVESTMENT BANK (IB). THESE ELECTIONS WERE MADE TO ALIGN FURTHER THE ACCOUNTING BASIS OF THE BRIDGE FINANCING ACTIVITIES WITH THEIR RELATED RISK

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET; THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS IS RECORDED WITHIN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ELECTED TO RECORD AT

FAIR VALUE RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE OR A MATURITY GREATER THAN ONE YEAR. THE INTENT OF THIS ELECTION WAS TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT BASIS FOR THE AGREEMENTS (WHICH WERE

PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS) AND THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS (WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS). AN ELECTION WAS NOT MADE FOR SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AS THE CARRYING VALUE FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS GENERALLY

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGE 136 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STRUCTURED NOTES

THE IB ISSUES STRUCTURED NOTES AS PART OF ITS CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES. STRUCTURED NOTES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM

DEBT. ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE FIRM ELECTED TO RECORD AT FAIR VALUE ALL STRUCTURED NOTES NOT PREVIOUSLY ELECTED OR ELIGIBLE FOR ELECTION UNDER SFAS 155. THE ELECTION WAS MADE TO MITIGATE THE VOLATILITY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT

BASIS FOR STRUCTURED NOTES AND THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO ELIMINATE THE OPERATIONAL BURDENS OF HAVING DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING MODELS FOR THE SAME TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTION

VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND RECOVERY INFORMATION,

WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.



LONG TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENTSPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE

CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD. THE GAIN FOR

2007, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WIDENING OF THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREAD.



RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, WITH A RESALE OR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN

EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED. AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING CERTAIN MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THE FIRM ADMINISTERS, JPMORGAN CHASE DECONSOLIDATED $29 BILLION OF INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES, $3 BILLION OF LOANS AND $1

BILLION OF SECURITIES, AND RECORDED $33 BILLION OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

NOTE 9  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 87 AND SFAS 88, AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

(OPEB) PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 106. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 158, WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE ON THEIR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THEIR DEFINED

BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION. SFAS 158 REQUIRES UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS (E.G., NET LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS) TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND THAT THESE AMOUNTS BE ADJUSTED AS THEY ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BASED UPON THE CURRENT AMORTIZATION AND RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 87 AND SFAS 106. THE

FIRM PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED SFAS 158 ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO AOCI OF $1.1 BILLION AT THAT DATE.

SFAS 158 ALSO ELIMINATES THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS 87 AND SFAS 106 THAT ALLOW PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS TO BE MEASURED AS OF A DATE NOT MORE THAN THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE REPORTING ENTITYS BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE FIRM USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31 FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS; THEREFORE, THIS PROVISION OF SFAS 158 HAD NO EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS, AS WELL AS PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY 10 YEARS. FOR OPEB PLANS,

ANY EXCESS NET GAINS AND LOSSES ALSO ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SIX YEARS; HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS

CURRENTLY FOUR YEARS.

124

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, IN THE FORM OF PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS, TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED UPON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN

BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, BENEFITS WILL VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE). THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED UPON FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS

POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS. THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2008 CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, IF ANY, IS NOT REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME. THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL 2008 CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IS $33 MILLION.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS ON

COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED, NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION PLAN WITH AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN THE AMOUNT OF $262 MILLION AND $301

MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS

IS THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIOS.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A ONE-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT AND ARE

IMMEDIATELY VESTED IN THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN MADE. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF $250,000 OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING

CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS (OPEB) TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES.

THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE CONTRIBUTORY, WHILE THE LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

(COLI) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM (10 YEARS OR MORE) RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES ARE DEVELOPED USING A

FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE

GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND

MARKETS.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE

IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K.

PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS, SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND AA-RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS, PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE

RATE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON A PORTFOLIO OF BONDS

WITH REDEMPTION DATES AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIO IS DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THIS HYPOTHETICAL

BOND PORTFOLIO GENERATES EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OPEB PLANS REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS BOND INDEX WITH A DURATION CORRESPONDING TO THAT OF THE UNDERLYING BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUALIZED ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PROJECTED AND ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE COMPONENTS OF NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, AS OF AND FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FIRM INCREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION FOR 2008. THE 2008 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB

PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.50% AND 7.00%, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION DECLINED FROM 10% IN 2007 TO 9.25% IN 2008, DECLINING TO A RATE OF 5% IN 2014. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE

ASSUMPTION AND THE ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT 5.25% AND 4.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, PENSION PLAN DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS WERE REVISED TO REFLECT RECENT EXPERIENCE RELATING TO FORM AND TIMING OF BENEFIT

DISTRIBUTIONS, AND RATES OF TURNOVER, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION FOR 2008.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A 25BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD

RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION IN 2008 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE. A 25BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN 2008 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $171 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN

INCREASE IN THE 2008 NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION. A 25-BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2008 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION AND AN

INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS

AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR AND ISSUER. SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX FOR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING VARIOUS RISK FACTORS AND EACH

PLANS INVESTMENT RETURN OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION, IN RECOGNITION OF ITS LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A

COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ARE REBALANCED TO WITHIN APPROVED RANGES, TO THE EXTENT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL.

THE FIRMS U.S.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE INVESTED IN A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITIES (INCLUDING U.S. LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES), FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT

BONDS), TREASURY INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE SIMILARLY INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED

PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRMS COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND PARTIALLY THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME INDEX FUNDS. IN ADDITION, TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL DEBT SECURITIES, HELD IN A TRUST, WERE USED TO FUND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN IN PRIOR PERIODS; AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE ARE NO REMAINING ASSETS IN THE TRUST. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE ASSETS USED TO FUND THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE

10  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 123R AND ALL RELATED INTERPRETATIONS USING THE MODIFIED

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. SFAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), TO BE MEASURED AT THEIR GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES. RESULTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS

HAVE NOT BEEN RETROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTED. THE FIRM ALSO ADOPTED THE TRANSITION ELECTION PROVIDED BY FSP FAS 123(R)-3.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED SFAS 123,

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, USING THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER SFAS 123, THE FIRM ACCOUNTED FOR ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AT FAIR VALUE, SIMILAR TO THE SFAS 123R REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD,

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUED TO ACCOUNT FOR UNMODIFIED STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, USING THE APB 25 INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, NO EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE

EQUAL TO THE STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE, SINCE SUCH OPTIONS HAVE NO INTRINSIC VALUE.

UPON ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRM BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER APB 25. ADDITIONALLY, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE AN IMMATERIAL CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RESULTING FROM THE SFAS 123R

REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE FORFEITURES AT THE GRANT DATE INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING THEM AS INCURRED. FINALLY, THE FIRM REVISED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR CONTINUED VESTING UNDER SPECIFIC AGE AND

SERVICE OR SERVICE-RELATED PROVISIONS (FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES) UNDER SFAS 123R. PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS GRANTED TO FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WAS TO

RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS STATED SERVICE PERIOD. BEGINNING WITH AWARDS GRANTED TO FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE

IMPACT OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE FIRM ALSO BEGAN TO ACCRUE THE ESTIMATED COST OF STOCK AWARDS GRANTED TO FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF 06-11, WHICH REQUIRES THAT REALIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS PAID ON EQUITY-CLASSIFIED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

THAT ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS SHOULD BE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AND INCLUDED IN THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO ABSORB TAX DEFICIENCIES ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF EITF

06-11, THE FIRM DID NOT INCLUDE THESE TAX BENEFITS AS PART OF THIS POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. THE FIRM ADOPTED EITF 06-11 ON JANUARY 1, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSENSUS DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN 2007 AND 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM

STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2005 PLAN). IN 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER THE 1996 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AS AMENDED (THE 1996

PLAN) UNTIL MAY 2005, AND AFTER MAY 2005, UNDER THE 2005 PLAN THEREAFTER TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. THESE TWO PLANS, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

PLANS (LTI PLANS). THE 2005 PLAN BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 17, 2005, AFTER APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE 2005 ANNUAL MEETING. THE 2005 PLAN REPLACED THREE EXISTING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS  THE 1996 PLAN AND TWO

NON-SHAREHOLDER APPROVED PLANS  ALL OF WHICH EXPIRED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 2005 PLAN. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2005 PLAN, 275 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE DURING ITS FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE 2005 PLAN IS

THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE

RECIPIENT UPON THEIR GRANT. RSUS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED ANNUALLY AND GENERALLY VEST 50 PERCENT AFTER TWO YEARS AND 50 PERCENT AFTER THREE YEARS AND CONVERT TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION, RSUS TYPICALLY INCLUDE FULL CAREER

ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS. ALL OF THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE. AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT TO

RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU IS OUTSTANDING.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS

AND SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE. THE FIRM TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR, AND IT ALSO PERIODICALLY GRANTS DISCRETIONARY

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF BOTH EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS. THE 2007 GRANT OF SARS TO KEY EMPLOYEES VESTS RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS (I.E., 20 PERCENT PER YEAR) AND THE 2006 AND 2005 AWARDS VEST

ONE-THIRD AFTER EACH OF YEARS 3, 4 AND 5. THESE AWARDS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FULL CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS AND ALL AWARDS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED (OTHER THAN GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE AT THE GRANT

DATE), COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR EACH TRANCHE

GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEES FULL CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING

DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRMS POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. ON APRIL 17,

2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON SHARES, WHICH SUPERSEDES AN $8.0 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2006. THE $10.0 BILLION

AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED PLANS. DURING 2007, THE FIRM SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FIRM ACCELERATED THE VESTING OF APPROXIMATELY 41 MILLION UNVESTED, OUT-OF-THE-MONEY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2001 UNDER THE GROWTH AND

PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SCHEDULED TO VEST IN JANUARY 2007. THESE OPTIONS WERE NOT MODIFIED OTHER THAN TO ACCELERATE VESTING. THE RELATED EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION, AND WAS RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. THE FIRM BELIEVED THAT AT THE TIME THE OPTIONS WERE ACCELERATED THEY HAD LIMITED ECONOMIC VALUE SINCE THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE ACCELERATED OPTIONS WAS $51.22 AND THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK ON THE

EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ACCELERATION WAS $39.69.

RSU ACTIVITY

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS MEASURED BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF SHARES

GRANTED MULTIPLIED BY THE STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE, AND IS RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES JPMORGAN CHASES RSU ACTIVITY FOR 2007.

IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R

DURING 2006, THE INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FIRMS ADOPTION OF SFAS123R WAS $712 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT

REPRESENTS AN ACCELERATED NONCASH RECOGNITION OF COSTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN INCURRED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ALSO AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (PRETAX) FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2006, WAS LOWER BY $712 MILLION, AND EACH OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (AFTER-TAX), AND NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS LOWER BY $442 MILLION, THAN IF THE FIRM HAD CONTINUED TO ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER APB 25 AND SFAS 123. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE $.13 AND $.12 LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN IF THE FIRM HAD NOT

ADOPTED SFAS 123R.

THE FIRM RECOGNIZED NONCASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO ITS VARIOUS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS OF $2.0 BILLION, $2.4 BILLION

(INCLUDING THE $712 MILLION INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS 123R) AND $1.6 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDED AN ACCRUAL FOR THE

ESTIMATED COST OF STOCK AWARDS TO BE GRANTED TO FULL CAREER ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF $500 MILLION AND $498 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION (PRETAX) OF

COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO UNVESTED AWARDS HAS NOT YET BEEN CHARGED TO NET INCOME. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED INTO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.4 YEARS. THE FIRM DOES NOT CAPITALIZE ANY COMPENSATION COST

RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES.

CASH FLOWS AND TAX BENEFITS

PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRM PRESENTED ALL TAX BENEFITS OF DEDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. BEGINNING IN 2006, SFAS 123R

REQUIRES THE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM THE TAX BENEFITS OF TAX DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS (I.E., EXCESS TAX BENEFITS) TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING CASH FLOWS.

THE TOTAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2007, 2006 AND 2005, WAS $810 MILLION, $947 MILLION AND $625 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IN VALUING OPTIONS. THE FIRM COMPLETED A REVIEW OF ITS EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IN 2006. EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE BEGAN TO VALUE ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER THAT DATE USING

AN EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION DERIVED FROM THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF ITS PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK OPTIONS.

THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE LENGTH

OF TIME THAT AN EMPLOYEE MIGHT HOLD AN OPTION OR SAR BEFORE IT IS EXERCISED OR CANCELED. THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION WAS DEVELOPED USING HISTORIC EXPERIENCE.

NOTE 12  SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS, HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6

ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED PRIMARILY AS AFS WHEN PURCHASED AS PART OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK. AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES AFTER ANY APPLICABLE SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT

AMORTIZED COST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE FIRM HAS NOT CLASSIFIED NEW PURCHASES OF SECURITIES AS HTM FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF AFS SECURITIES IS EVALUATED CONSIDERING NUMEROUS FACTORS, AND THEIR RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE VARIES CASE-BY-CASE. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER OF A SECURITY; AND THE FIRMS INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN

FAIR VALUE. IF, BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF EACH OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS.

INCLUDED IN THE $172 MILLION OF GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $98 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR A

PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE SECURITIES ARE PRE-

DOMINATELY RATED AAA AND THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO OVERALL INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND NOT CONCERNS REGARDING THE UNDERLYING CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES AGED

GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS ARE OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND HAVE A FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THAT IS WITHIN 4% OF THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

DUE TO THE ISSUERS CONTINUED SATISFACTION OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE SECURITIES, THE FIRMS EVALUATION OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ISSUERS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER OBJECTIVE

EVIDENCE, AND THE FIRMS CONSIDERATION OF ITS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITIES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR THE ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THESE SECURITIES WERE

NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006.

NOTE 13  SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE

AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

RESALE AGREEMENTS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS

COLLATERALIZED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. ON JANUARY 1, 2007, PURSUANT TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159, THE FIRM

ELECTED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR CERTAIN RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SFAS 159, SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGES 119121 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE AGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER

RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY FOR AGREEMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE WITH

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 133, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY

INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 41. JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES

PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES, AND REQUESTS

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN NECESSARY.

TRANSACTIONS SIMILAR TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER

THAN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE) OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A FORWARD OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A DERIVATIVE, IS RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE

RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE

14  LOANS

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN MAY DIFFER BASED UPON THE TYPE OF LOAN AND/OR ITS USE IN AN INVESTING OR TRADING STRATEGY. THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

FOR LOANS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES FOR LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT;



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE FOR LOANS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE; OR



AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE FOR LOANS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

SEE NOTE 5 ON PAGES 119121 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS ELECTIONS OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS

159. SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

INTEREST INCOME IS

RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST METHOD, OR ON A BASIS APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.

LOANS WITHIN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO. TRANSFERS TO HELD-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO CREDIT LOSSES ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, OR EXCHANGE RATES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE

ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE

AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL CASH

THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH LOANS. LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS ARE REASONABLY ASSURED. LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF TO THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON

REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR

WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING OF BANKRUPTCY, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT NO LATER THAN 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS, IF

COLLATERALIZED, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS, EDUCATION FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN

IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER CONSUMER

LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME WHEN THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF. A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURE AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER ASSETS, ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN

CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

NOTE 15  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) AND CONSUMER (SCORED) LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO.

MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOANS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT. THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND MEASURED PURSUANT TO SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF THE LOAN IS LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, AND SMALLER

IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

LOANS. IT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION. THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (PD) AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (LGD). FOR RISK-RATED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS), THESE FACTORS ARE

DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND MATURITY. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL DATA, PRIMARILY CREDIT RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A STUDY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE. FOR SCORED

LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS), LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT WITHIN ESTIMATED RANGES TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION. WHERE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE RISK-RATED

PORTFOLIOS, THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, RELEVANT INTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT

PORTFOLIO AND EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE

CALCULATION WHERE RELEVANT. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE DETERMINATION OF

THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS

AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT

IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT. MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE

FIRM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET IDENTIFIABLE).

NOTE 16  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF ITS CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS, INCLUDING WAREHOUSE LOANS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED IN TRADING ASSETS. CONSUMER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

SECURITIZATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND EDUCATION LOANS THAT ARE ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY RFS AND CARD SERVICES (CS). WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SECURITIZATIONS OF PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

LOANS AND COMMERCIAL LOANS (PRIMARILY REAL ESTATERELATED) ORIGINATED BY THE IB.

JPMORGAN CHASESPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE

SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE SPES ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 108 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE

FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW) BUT ARE INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE QSPE PURCHASING THE ASSETS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE VEHICLES IS TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS AND TO GENERATE

LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM THROUGH THE SALE OF LOANS TO THE QSPES. ASSETS HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE

FIRMS CREDITORS; (2) THE ENTITY CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS OR, IF THE ENTITY IS A QSPE, ITS INVESTORS CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THEIR INTERESTS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL TO REPURCHASE THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS THAT MEET

THE ACCOUNTING SALES CRITERIA, THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE LOANS SOLD AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS, BASED UPON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE OF SALE.

GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR THE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED

CASH FLOWS USING MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED.

INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS MAY BE RETAINED BY THE FIRM IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED TRANCHES AND ESCROW ACCOUNTS. THE

CLASSIFICATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF INTEREST (E.G., WHETHER THE RETAINED INTEREST IS REPRESENTED BY A SECU-

RITY CERTIFICATE) AND WHEN IT WAS RETAINED, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS

155. THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO FAIR VALUE ALL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED LOANS RETAINED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2005, THAT HAVE AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE REQUIRED TO BE BIFURCATED UNDER SFAS 155; THESE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE CLASSIFIED PRIMARILY AS TRADING

ASSETS. RETAINED INTERESTS RELATED TO WHOLESALE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 155, FOR CONSUMER ACTIVITIES, SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY CERTIFICATE

WERE CLASSIFIED AS AFS; RETAINED INTERESTS NOT REPRESENTED BY A SECURITY CERTIFICATE WERE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER ASSETS.

FOR THOSE RETAINED INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT

TO PREPAYMENT RISK (SUCH THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT) BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE BIFURCATED UNDER SFAS 155, THE RETAINED INTERESTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE; SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN

EARNINGS OR IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). RETAINED INTERESTS CLASSIFIED AS AFS ARE SUBJECT TO THE IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS OF EITF 99-20.

CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS, REPRESENTING THE FIRMS INTERESTS IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SECURITIZED. THESE SELLERS INTERESTS ARE NOT

REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LOANS.

2007, 2006 AND 2005 SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE NEW

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE COMPLETED DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005; THE RESULTING GAINS ARISING FROM SUCH SECURITIZATIONS; CERTAIN CASH FLOWS RECEIVED FROM SUCH SECURITIZATIONS; AND THE KEY ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MEASURING THE RETAINED

INTERESTS (IF ANY) OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL MSRS (FOR A DISCUSSION OF RESIDENTIAL MSRS, SEE NOTE 18 ON PAGES 154157 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT), AS OF THE DATES OF SUCH SALES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

141

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, THE FIRM SOLD

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $81.8 BILLION, $53.7 BILLION AND $52.5 BILLION DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY FOR SECURITIZATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (GNMA), FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE

ASSOCIATION (FNMA) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE MAC); THESE SALES RESULTED IN PRETAX GAINS OF $47 MILLION, $251 MILLION AND $293 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RETAINED SERVICING

JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL ORIGINATED

AND FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY SECURITIZATIONS IT SPONSORS, AND RECEIVES SERVICING FEES BASED UPON THE SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE PLUS CERTAIN

ANCILLARY FEES. THE FIRM ALSO RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IT SELLS TO GNMA, FNMA AND FREDDIE MAC. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, SEE NOTE 18 ON PAGES 154157 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM PROVIDES MORTGAGE SERVICING ON A RECOURSE AND NON-RECOURSE BASIS. IN NON-RECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING

ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS SUCH AS FNMA OR FREDDIE MAC OR WITH A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON

RECOURSE SERVICING OCCUR PRIMARILY WHEN FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED MORTGAGE ARE LESS THAN THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND ACCRUED INTEREST OF THE LOAN AND THE COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE

UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE FIRMS MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY NON-RECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, THE AMOUNT OF RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS TOTALED $557 MILLION AND $649 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RETAINED SECURITIZATIONS INTEREST

AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE FIRM HAD, WITH RESPECT TO ITS CREDIT CARD MASTER TRUSTS, $18.6 BILLION AND $19.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO UNDIVIDED INTERESTS,

AND $2.7 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES ON THE SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES, NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF 4% TO 12% OF THE PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 19% FOR 2007 AND 21% FOR 2006. THE FIRM ALSO

MAINTAINS ESCROW ACCOUNTS UP TO PREDETERMINED LIMITS FOR SOME CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND EDUCATION SECURITIZATIONS

TO

COVER THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF DEFICIENCIES IN CASH FLOWS OWED TO INVESTORS. THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE IN SUCH ESCROW ACCOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, AMOUNTED TO $97 MILLION, $21 MILLION AND $3 MILLION FOR CREDIT

CARD, AUTOMOBILE AND EDUCATION SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY; AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THESE AMOUNTS WERE $153 MILLION AND $56 MILLION FOR CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE SECURITIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OTHER RETAINED SECURITIZATION INTERESTS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY SUBORDINATED OR

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED UPON A 10% OR 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED EASILY BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE

A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH

MIGHT COUNTERACT OR MAGNIFY THE SENSITIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN MODIFICATIONS

SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON PAGE 183 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE FIRMS DEFINITION OF

SUBPRIME LOANS. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LIMITED DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES OF A QSPE UNDER SFAS 140, THE OPERATING DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN EXISTING SUBPRIME SECURITIZATIONS GENERALLY AUTHORIZE THE SERVICER TO MODIFY LOANS FOR WHICH DEFAULT IS

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, PROVIDED THAT THE MODIFICATION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE QSPES BENEFICIAL INTEREST HOLDERS, AND WOULD NOT RESULT IN A REMIC VIOLATION.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM (ASF) ISSUED THE STREAMLINED FORECLOSURE AND LOSS AVOIDANCE FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS (THE FRAMEWORK). THE

FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR SERVICERS TO STREAMLINE EVALUATION PROCEDURES FOR BORROWERS WITH CERTAIN SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE (ARM) LOANS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE MODIFICATIONS OF SUCH LOANS WITH TERMS THAT ARE MORE

APPROPRIATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SUCH BORROWERS. THE FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL FIRST-LIEN SUBPRIME ARM LOANS THAT HAVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF 36 MONTHS OR LESS, ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIZED POOLS, WERE ORIGINATED

BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005, AND JULY 31, 2007, AND HAVE AN INITIAL INTEREST RATE RESET DATE BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2008, AND JULY 31, 2010 (ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS).

THE FRAMEWORK CATEGORIZES THE POPULATION OF ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS INTO THREE SEGMENTS. SEGMENT 1 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS CURRENT AND IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO ANY AVAILABLE MORTGAGE PRODUCT. SEGMENT 2

INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS CURRENT, IS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO ANY READILY AVAILABLE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY PRODUCT AND MEETS CERTAIN DEFINED CRITERIA. SEGMENT 3 INCLUDES LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER IS NOT CURRENT, AS DEFINED, AND

DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR SEGMENTS 1 OR 2.

ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS IN SEGMENT 2 OF THE FRAMEWORK ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FAST-TRACK MODIFICATION UNDER WHICH THE INTEREST

RATE WILL BE KEPT AT THE EXISTING INITIAL RATE, GENERALLY FOR FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE INTEREST RATE RESET DATE. THE FRAMEWORK INDICATES THAT FOR SEGMENT 2 LOANS, JPMORGAN CHASE, AS SERVICER, MAY PRESUME THAT THE BORROWER WILL BE

UNABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THE ORIGINAL

TERMS OF THE BORROWERS LOAN AFTER THE INITIAL INTEREST RATE RESET DATE. THUS, THE FIRM MAY PRESUME THAT A DEFAULT ON THAT LOAN BY THE BORROWER IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE UNLESS THE TERMS OF THE LOAN ARE MODIFIED. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS ADOPTED THE

LOSS MITIGATION APPROACHES UNDER THE FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITIZED SUBPRIME LOANS THAT MEET THE SPECIFIC SEGMENT 2 SCREENING CRITERIA, AND IT EXPECTS TO BEGIN MODIFYING SEGMENT 2 LOANS BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE

ADOPTION OF THE FRAMEWORK WILL NOT AFFECT THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED QSPES THAT HOLD SEGMENT 2 SUBPRIME LOANS.

THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF ASSETS OWNED BY FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES THAT HOLD ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS (INCLUDING THOSE LOANS THAT ARE NOT SERVICED BY THE FIRM) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $20.0 BILLION. OF THIS AMOUNT, $9.7 BILLION RELATES TO ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS

SERVICED BY THE FIRM. BASED ON CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 20%, 10% AND 70% OF THE ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS IT SERVICES THAT ARE OWNED BY FIRM-SPONSORED QSPES WILL FALL WITHIN SEGMENTS 1, 2 AND 3, RESPECTIVELY. THIS

ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN HOUSING VALUES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INVESTOR/BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

TOTAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS THAT HOLD ASF FRAMEWORK LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS AS FOLLOWS.

NOTE 17  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE 108 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES POLICIES REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL

INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES OCCURS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANK: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THE IB IS INVOLVED WITH VIES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND

FOR INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION PURPOSES AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THE IB ALSO SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH QSPES, TO CREATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET MANAGEMENT (AM): PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE FIRMS MUTUAL FUNDS DEEMED VIES. AM EARNS A FIXED FEE BASED UPON

ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AMS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH FUNDS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS

UNDER FIN 46R.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR THE SERVICES

IT PROVIDES. THE RELATIONSHIPS RESULTING FROM TSS SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



COMMERCIAL BANKING (CB): UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE

OF PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OFFERED IN THE IB. CB MAY ASSIST IN THE STRUCTURING AND/OR ONGOING ADMINISTRATION OF THESE VIES AND MAY PROVIDE LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE VIE. THE RELATIONSHIPS

RESULTING FROM CBS SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT COULD BE DEEMED VIES. PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE AICPA AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING GUIDE

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

(THE GUIDE). IN JUNE 2007, THE AICPA ISSUED SOP 07-1, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ENTITY IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GUIDE, AND THEREFORE QUALIFIES TO

USE THE GUIDES SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (REFERRED TO AS INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING). IN MAY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FIN 46(R)-7, WHICH AMENDS FIN 46R TO PERMANENTLY EXEMPT ENTITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GUIDE FROM

APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46R TO THEIR INVESTMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB AGREED TO AN INDEFINITE DELAY OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SOP 07-1 IN ORDER TO ADDRESS IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DELAYS FSP FIN 46(R)-7 AS WELL FOR THOSE

COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE FIRM, THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED SOP 07-1. HAD FIN 46R BEEN APPLIED TO VIES SUBJECT TO THIS DEFERRAL, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL TO THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE IB IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED WITH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND VIES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES. A DISCUSSION

OF THESE VIES FOLLOWS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, AND IT HELPS CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS

THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN

MOST INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) TO THE CONDUITS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF

HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS, AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS,

LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONDUITS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RECEIVES FEES RELATED TO THE STRUCTURING OF MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AND RECEIVES COMPENSATION FROM THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR ITS ROLE AS

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND PROVIDER OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT.

AS A MEANS OF ENSURING TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH

ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE

TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED SO THAT THE LIQUIDITY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE FIRM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WILL BE EFFECTED BY THE FIRM PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL OF NONDEFAULTED,

PERFORMING ASSETS. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER

TO PERFORM UNDER ITS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CONDUIT AT ANY TIME. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE CONDUIT AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS THEN CURRENT FAIR VALUE

 IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT.

THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT

VEHICLES WITH PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, IN THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED SHORT-TERM REVOLVING FACILITIES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS TO HANDLE FUNDING INCREMENTS TOO SMALL TO BE FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND IN THE FORM OF UNCOMMITTED

LIQUIDITY FACILITIES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE CONDUITS ONLY IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET.

146

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES WILL ONLY FUND NONDEFAULTED ASSETS, PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ABSORB LOSSES ON DEFAULTED

RECEIVABLES IN EXCESS OF LOSSES ABSORBED BY DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT MAY BE PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE FORM OF STANDBY

LETTERS OF CREDIT OR BY A THIRD-PARTY SURETY BOND PROVIDER. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED VARIES BY CONDUIT AND RANGES BETWEEN 5% AND 10% OF

TOTAL ASSETS.

THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF DRAWN COMMITMENTS (I.E., SELLERS ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FOR WHICH THE FIRM PROVIDES LIQUIDITY

SUPPORT) OF $61.2 BILLION AND $43.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, PLUS CONTRACTUAL BUT UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS OF $27.7 BILLION AND $24.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE THE FIRM PROVIDES

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND LIQUIDITY TO FIRM-ADMINISTERED, MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IS NOT ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD BE ABSORBED BY THIRD-PARTY LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS.

ASSETS FUNDED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

JPMORGAN CHASES ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS FUND A VARIETY OF ASSET TYPES FOR

THE FIRMS CLIENTS. ASSET TYPES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, AUTO LOANS AND LEASES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, EDUCATION LOANS, COMMERCIAL LOANS, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS (E.G., LOANS TO PRIVATE EQUITY, MEZZANINE AND

REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY FUNDS

SECURED BY CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF HIGHLY RATED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS), AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSET TYPES. IT IS THE FIRMS INTENTION THAT THE ASSETS FUNDED BY ITS

ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS BE SOURCED ONLY FROM THE FIRMS CLIENTS AND NOT BE ORIGINATED BY OR TRANSFERRED FROM JPMORGAN CHASE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSETS HELD BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT IF THE ASSETS WERE RATED, THE FIRM BELIEVES THE MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD RECEIVE AN A

RATING OR BETTER BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES. HOWEVER, IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THE ASSETS HELD BY THE CONDUITS TO BE EXPLICITLY RATED BY AN EXTERNAL RATING AGENCY. INSTEAD, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK GROUP ASSIGNS EACH ASSET PURCHASE LIQUIDITY FACILITY

AN INTERNAL RISK-RATING BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT FOR THE TRANSACTION. THE RATINGS PROVIDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE REFLECT THE S&P-EQUIVALENT RATINGS OF THE INTERNAL RATING GRADES ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM.

THE RISK RATINGS ARE PERIODICALLY REASSESSED AS INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, A NUMBER OF

ASSET PURCHASE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES HAD INTERNAL RATINGS DOWNGRADES. THESE DOWNGRADES INVOLVED FACILITIES ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET TYPES. THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF DOWNGRADES RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE AND EDUCATION LOAN EXPOSURES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, 99% OF THE ASSETS IN THE CONDUITS WERE RISK RATED A- OR BETTER.

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WAS 51 DAYS IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 36 DAYS IN 2006, AND THE AVERAGE YIELD ON

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS 5.3% IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 5.0% IN 2006.

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, THE ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WAS CHALLENGING AS INVESTORS

WERE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURES. THESE CONCERNS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE ABILITY OF MANY VIES TO REISSUE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER. HOWEVER, INVESTORS HAVE CONTINUED TO PURCHASE THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE

FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, ALTHOUGH AT HIGHER YIELDS AND SHORTER MATURITIES. COMMERCIAL PAPER SPREADS WIDENED MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN DECEMBER 2007, REFLECTING COMMERCIAL PAPER INVESTORS CONCERNS ABOUT YEAR-END REDEMPTIONS AND

THEIR NEED TO HAVE CASH AVAILABLE.

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE TRADES AND INVESTS IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE

FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS. THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PURCHASED BY THE FIRM ACROSS ALL FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS DURING 2007 RANGED FROM LESS THAN 1% TO APPROXIMATELY 10% ON ANY GIVEN DAY. THE LARGEST DAILY AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM IN ANY

ONE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT DURING 2007 WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION, OR 16%, OF THE CONDUITS COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER HELD BY THE FIRM AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WAS $131 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM IS NOT OBLIGATED UNDER ANY AGREEMENT (CONTRACTUAL OR NONCONTRACTUAL) TO PURCHASE THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY JPMORGAN CHASE-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS.

SIGNIFICANT 2007 ACTIVITY

IN JULY 2007, A REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES HELD BY A FIRM-ADMINISTERED

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT WAS PUT TO JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER ITS DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY. THE ASSET WAS TRANSFERRED TO AND RECORDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE AT ITS PAR VALUE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THAT SUPPORTED THE REVERSE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE STATISTICS, RESULTED IN THE DETERMINATION BY THE FIRM THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL WAS IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT

LOSSES WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE

EXPECTED LOSS NOTE (ELN) HOLDER (THE PARTY THAT ABSORBS THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSS FROM THE CONDUIT) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS

OF THE ELN NOTE.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2007, CERTAIN STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS ORIGINATED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 AND BACKED BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGES WERE TRANSFERRED

TO THE FIRM FROM TWO FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. IT BECAME CLEAR IN OCTOBER THAT COMMERCIAL PAPER INVESTORS AND RATING AGENCIES WERE BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT CDO ASSETS BACKED BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURES. BECAUSE OF

THESE CONCERNS, AND TO ENSURE THE CONTINUING VIABILITY OF THE TWO CONDUITS AS FINANCING VEHICLES FOR CLIENTS AND AS INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER INVESTORS, THE FIRM, IN ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATOR, TRANSFERRED THE CDO ASSETS OUT OF THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THE STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM AT THEIR PAR VALUE OF $1.4 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE CDO ASSETS WERE VALUED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT $291 MILLION.

THERE ARE NO OTHER STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS BACKED BY SUBPRIME MORTGAGES REMAINING IN JPMORGAN CHASE-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM HAS NO PLANS TO PERMIT THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS TO PURCHASE SUCH ASSETS IN THE FUTURE.

CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ADMINISTERED BY THE FIRM ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, BECAUSE EACH CONDUIT HAD ISSUED ELNS, THE HOLDERS OF WHICH ARE COMMITTED TO

ABSORBING THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSS OF EACH RESPECTIVE CONDUIT.

IMPLIED SUPPORT

THE FIRMS EXPECTED LOSS MODELING TREATS ALL VARIABLE INTERESTS, OTHER THAN THE ELNS, AS ITS OWN TO DETERMINE CONSOLIDATION. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THE OCTOBER 2007 TRANSFER OF THE STRUCTURED CDO ASSETS FROM THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS TO JPMORGAN CHASE TO BE AN INDICATOR OF JPMORGAN CHASES INTENT TO PROVIDE IMPLICIT SUPPORT TO THE ELN HOLDERS. INSTEAD, THIS ACTION WAS A ONE-TIME, ISOLATED EVENT, LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC TYPE OF ASSET THAT IS NOT TYPICALLY

FUNDED IN THE FIRMS ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS NO PLANS (IN ITS CAPACITY AS ADMINISTRATOR) TO ALLOW THE CONDUITS TO PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY ELN HOLDERS FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE CONDUITS HOLDINGS AND HAS NO PLANS TO REMOVE ANY ASSETS FROM ANY CONDUIT UNLESS REQUIRED TO DO SO

IN ITS ROLE AS ADMINISTRATOR. SHOULD SUCH A TRANSFER OCCUR, THE FIRM WOULD ALLOCATE LOSSES ON SUCH ASSETS BETWEEN ITSELF AND THE ELN HOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ELN.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

EXPECTED LOSS MODELING

IN 2006, THE FIRM RESTRUCTURED FOUR MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THAT IT

ADMINISTERS. THE RESTRUCTURINGS INCLUDED ENHANCING THE FIRMS EXPECTED LOSS MODEL. IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS IT ADMINISTERS, THE FIRM USES A MONTE CARLOBASED MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF EACH OF

THE CONDUITS AND CONSIDERS THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE VARIABILITY TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MODELING OF EXPECTED LOSSES IS BASED ON THE DESIGN OF THE ENTITY. THE FIRMS TRADITIONAL

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE DESIGNED TO PASS CREDIT RISK, NOT LIQUIDITY RISK, TO ITS VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS, AS THE ASSETS ARE INTENDED TO BE HELD IN THE CONDUIT FOR THE LONGER TERM.

UNDER FIN 46R, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO RUN THE MONTE CARLO-BASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH TIME A RECONSIDERATION EVENT OCCURS. IN APPLYING THIS GUIDANCE TO THE CONDUITS, THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE RECONSIDERATION

EVENTS AS THEY COULD AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONDUITS.



NEW DEALS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL VARIABLE INTERESTS (CREDIT SUPPORT, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC);



CHANGES IN USAGE, INCLUDING THE CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING VARIABLE INTERESTS (CREDIT SUPPORT, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES, ETC);



MODIFICATIONS OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND



SALES OF INTERESTS HELD BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FROM AN OPERATIONAL

PERSPECTIVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT RUN ITS MONTE CARLO-BASED EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EVERY TIME THERE IS A RECONSIDERATION EVENT DUE TO THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR OCCURRENCE. INSTEAD, THE FIRM RUNS ITS EXPECTED LOSS MODEL EACH QUARTER AND INCLUDES A GROWTH

ASSUMPTION FOR EACH CONDUIT TO ENSURE THAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF ELNS EXISTS FOR EACH CONDUIT AT ANY POINT DURING THE QUARTER.

AS PART OF ITS NORMAL QUARTERLY MODEL

REVIEW, THE FIRM REASSESSES THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS OF THE EXPECTED LOSS MODEL. DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODEL WERE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE THEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY, RISK

RATINGS AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO RESIDENTIAL SUBPRIME MORTGAGE EXPOSURES WERE MODIFIED. FOR OTHER NONMORTGAGE-RELATED ASSET CLASSES, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE MODEL REQUIRED LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. AS A RESULT

OF THE UPDATES TO THE MODEL, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 THE TERMS OF THE ELNS WERE RENEGOTIATED TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT AND FUNDED AMOUNTS TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ELN HOLDERS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EXPECTED LOSS NOTES OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WERE $130 MILLION AND $54 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USED WERE REFLECTIVE OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED THE PROBABILITY OF A

RECURRENCE OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS.

QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

THE

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT MEANS FOR CLIENTS TO ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE CONDUITS EFFECTIVELY DISPERSE RISK AMONG ALL PARTIES AND THAT THE PREPONDERANCE OF ECONOMIC RISK IN

THE FIRMS MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IS NOT HELD BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS IN THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS THAT THE FIRM VIEWS AS CLIENT-RELATED REPRESENT 99% AND 98% OF THE TOTAL CONDUITS HOLDINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSOLIDATED SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON CAPITAL

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRM COULD BE

REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE A VIE IF IT WERE DETERMINED THAT THE FIRM BECAME THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46R. THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT A VIE SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED ARE

DISCUSSED ABOVE AND IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 108 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE IMPACT ON THE FIRMS REPORTED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET INCOME, TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AND TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO IF THE FIRM WERE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE

THE FIRM COULD FUND PURCHASES OF ASSETS FROM VIES SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY.

INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF

VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS, TYPICALLY DERIVATIVE STRUCTURES, WITH THESE VIES TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE

MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN THESE STRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES AND

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM

HAS CREATED A SERIES OF SECONDARY MARKET TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH QUALIFYING TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A TYPICAL

TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF SECURITIES: (1) PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

(RESIDUAL INTERESTS). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS IS LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY PUT, OR TENDER, THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER

TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE, IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY, THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE

EITHER TO EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

THE THIRD-PARTY HOLDERS OF THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN THESE

VEHICLES COULD EXPERIENCE LOSSES IF THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES EXCEEDS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE. CERTAIN VEHICLES REQUIRE A SMALLER INITIAL INVESTMENT BY THE RESIDUAL

INTEREST HOLDERS AND THUS DO NOT RESULT IN EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION. FOR THESE VEHICLES THERE EXISTS A REIMBURSEMENT OBLI-

150

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GATION

WHICH REQUIRES THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS TO POST, DURING THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO THE VEHICLE ON A DAILY BASIS AS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINES.

JPMORGAN CHASE OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER AND REMARKETING AGENT OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. AS THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, THE FIRM HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES; THIS OBLIGATION IS TRIGGERED BY THE FAILURE TO REMARKET THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN

TERMINATION EVENTS WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AND THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. IN VEHICLES IN WHICH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN

THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, IN ADDITION TO THE TERMINATION EVENTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND THE EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE OR THE

REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES; AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, THE FIRM HELD $617 MILLION AND $275 MILLION OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM AT ANY TIME DURING 2007 WAS $1.0 BILLION, OR 5%, OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLES OUTSTANDING PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. DURING 2007 AND 2006, THE FIRM DID NOT EXPERIENCE A DRAW ON THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE

DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND TO THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND. A DOWNGRADE OF A BOND INSURER WOULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH WOULD

AFFECT THE RATING OF THE PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THIS COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR, AS PUTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS TYPICALLY REQUIRE AN AA- BOND RATING. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, 99% OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS HELD BY VEHICLES TO WHICH THE FIRM SERVED AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER WERE RATED AA- OR BETTER. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, $702 MILLION AND $606 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THE BONDS WERE INSURED BY A THIRD PARTY. DURING 2007 AND 2006, THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY BANKRUPTCY OR DOWNGRADE TERMINATION EVENTS.

THE FIRM SOMETIMES INVESTS IN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS OF MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. FOR VIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE VIES. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE FIRM WOULD HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE VIES WHERE THE

FIRM DOES NOT OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS AND THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFF-BALANCE SHEET IS REMOTE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH CREDIT-LINKED NOTE

(CLN) VEHICLES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY RATED ASSETS (SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES) AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT HOLD.

THE VIE THEN ISSUES CLNS WITH MATURITIES PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO 10 YEARS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE VIES INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER USING A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY

THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN SUCH NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE CLN VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE

VIE AS THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLN VEHICLES. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE

COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES IS INVESTMENT-GRADE, WITH A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY BEING RATED AAA. THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS

CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURES BROADLY INTO TWO TYPES: STATIC AND MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT

DERIVATIVE CONTRACT EITHER REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION) OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. THE FIRM GENERALLY BUYS PROTECTION FROM THE VIE UNDER THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT

PROTECTION, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE REFERENCE CREDITS DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF THE REFERENCE CREDITS

EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS.

IN A MANAGED CREDIT-LINKED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE GENERALLY REFERENCE ALL OR PART OF AN ACTIVELY MANAGED

PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. AN AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN A PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND THE VIE THAT GIVES THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE EACH REFERENCED CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CREDIT. BY PARTICIPATING IN A STRUCTURE WHERE A

PORTFOLIO MANAGER HAS THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE CREDITS WITHIN PRE-AGREED TERMS, THE INVESTORS WHO OWN THE CLNS SEEK TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT ANY SINGLE CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL DEFAULT. THE FIRM DOES NOT ACT AS PORTFOLIO MANAGER; ITS INVOLVEMENT

WITH THE VIE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO BEING A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE CREDITS WITHIN

THE PORTFOLIO DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF REFERENCE CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS. EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WAS AS FOLLOWS.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS VEHICLES

A CDO TYPICALLY REFERS TO A SECURITY THAT IS COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF BONDS, LOANS, EQUITY,

DERIVATIVES OR OTHER ASSETS. THE FIRMS INVOLVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CDO VEHICLE MAY TAKE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS: ARRANGER, WAREHOUSE FUNDING PROVIDER, PLACEMENT AGENT OR UNDERWRITER, SECONDARY MARKET-MAKER FOR SECURITIES ISSUED,

OR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY.

PRIOR TO THE FORMAL ESTABLISHMENT OF A CDO VEHICLE, THERE IS A WAREHOUSING PERIOD WHERE A VIE MAY BE USED TO ACCUMULATE THE ASSETS WHICH

WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY SECURITIZED AND WILL SERVE AS THE COLLATERAL FOR THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED TO INVESTORS. DURING THIS WAREHOUSING PERIOD, THE FIRM MAY PROVIDE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FINANCING TO THE VIE, FOR WHICH THE FIRM

EARNS INTEREST ON THE AMOUNTS IT FINANCES. A

THIRD-PARTY ASSET MANAGER THAT WILL SERVE AS THE MANAGER FOR THE CDO VEHICLE USES THE WAREHOUSE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FIRM TO PURCHASE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS. THE FUNDING COMMITMENTS GENERALLY ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. IN THE EVENT THAT THE

SECURITIZATION OF ASSETS DOES NOT OCCUR WITHIN THE COMMITTED FINANCING PERIOD, THE WAREHOUSED ASSETS ARE GENERALLY LIQUIDATED.

BECAUSE OF THE VARIED LEVELS OF

SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE FIRM DURING THE WAREHOUSING PERIOD, WHICH TYPICALLY AVERAGES SIX TO NINE MONTHS, EACH CDO WAREHOUSE VIE IS ASSESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46(R) TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRM IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY THAT SHOULD

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE. IN GENERAL, THE FIRM WOULD CONSOLIDATE THE WAREHOUSE VIE UNLESS ANOTHER THIRD PARTY, TYPICALLY THE ASSET MANAGER,

152

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVIDES

SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION FOR POTENTIAL DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE. IN THOSE CASES, THE THIRD PARTY THAT PROVIDES THE PROTECTION TO THE WAREHOUSE VIE WOULD CONSOLIDATE THE VIE.

ONCE THE PORTFOLIO OF WAREHOUSED ASSETS IS LARGE ENOUGH, THE VIE WILL ISSUE SECURITIES. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SECURITIES ISSUANCE WILL BE USED TO REPAY THE WAREHOUSE FINANCING

OBTAINED FROM THE FIRM AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CDO VEHICLE, THE FIRM TYPICALLY EARNS A FEE FOR ARRANGING THE CDO VEHICLE AND DISTRIBUTING THE SECURITIES (AS PLACEMENT AGENT AND/OR UNDERWRITER) AND DOES

NOT TYPICALLY OWN ANY EQUITY TRANCHES ISSUED. ONCE

THE CDO VEHICLE CLOSES AND ISSUES SECURITIES, THE FIRM HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT TO THE VEHICLE. AT THE TIME OF CLOSING, THE FIRM MAY HOLD UNSOLD POSITIONS THAT THE FIRM WAS NOT ABLE TO PLACE WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS.

THE AMOUNT OF UNSOLD POSITIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS INSIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY ON OCCASION HOLD SOME OF THE CDO VEHICLES SECURITIES AS A SECONDARY MARKET-MAKER OR AS A PRINCIPAL INVESTOR, OR IT MAY BE A DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTY TO THE VEHICLES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN CHASE. SEE NOTE 21 ON PAGE 159 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE MATURITY PROFILE OF FIN 46 LONG-TERM BENEFICIAL INTERESTS.

OTHER TOPICS RELATED TO VIES

VIES STRUCTURED BY UNRELATED PARTIES

THE FIRM ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR,

UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT, TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE BASED UPON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING

ASSETS. WHERE THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIES OR TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIES, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET

SIMILAR TO THE WAY IT WOULD RECORD AND REPORT POSITIONS FROM ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES UNDER FIN 46(R).

NOTE 18  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. IT IS INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS 142 AT THE REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 34 ON PAGES 175177 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY (WHICH IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE).

GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY (DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT

AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, SUCH AS CORE DEPOSITS AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN

A MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED PERIODICALLY ON THESE AMORTIZING INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON

SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE AMOUNT INITIALLY

CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PAID TO THIRD PARTIES TO ACQUIRE MSRS OR IS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, IF RETAINED UPON THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS FOR INITIAL CAPITALIZATION AND

ONGOING VALUATION USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL, WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE CASH

154

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLOWS AT

RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM

REASSESSES AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTS THE UNDERLYING INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OAS MODEL TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER IN VALUING THE MSR ASSET. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE 2007,

THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL WAS REFINED TO REFLECT A DECREASE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF MARKET RELATED FACTORS INCLUDING A DOWNWARD TREND IN HOME PRICES, GENERAL TIGHTENING OF CREDIT

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON REFINANCING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES OR HAS USED COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES, AFS

SECURITIES AND TRADING INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. MSRS DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN

INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE.

IN MARCH 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 156, WHICH PERMITS AN ENTITY A ONE-TIME IRREVOCABLE ELECTION TO ADOPT FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR A CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE

ELECTED TO ADOPT THE STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND DEFINED MSRS AS ONE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS FOR THIS ELECTION. AT THE TRANSITION DATE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT, NET OF ANY RELATED VALUATION

ALLOWANCE, BY $150 MILLION NET OF TAXES. THIS AMOUNT WAS RECORDED AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006. MSRS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, AND CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE

RECORDED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. REVENUE AMOUNTS RELATED TO MSRS AND THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USED TO MANAGE THE RISK OF MSRS ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, MSRS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 140, USING A LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, MSRS WERE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME RECEIVED IN

PROPORTION TO, AND OVER THE PERIOD OF, THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SERVICING INCOME STREAM OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS. FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND MEASURING IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIED THE PORTFOLIO ON THE BASIS OF THE PREDOMINANT

RISK CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH ARE LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST RATE. ANY INDICATED IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE THROUGH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH REPRESENTED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRATUM EXCEEDED

ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. ANY GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND RELAT-

ED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AMOUNTS WHICH WERE NOT EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, BASED UPON THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, WERE CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 156, THE FIRM DESIGNATED CERTAIN DERIVATIVES USED TO RISK MANAGE MSRS (E.G., A COMBINATION OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS AND FLOORS) AS SFAS 133 FAIR VALUE

HEDGES OF BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE RISK. SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING ALLOWED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED MSRS TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES WAS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS.

THE DESIGNATED HEDGE PERIOD WAS DAILY. IN DESIGNATING THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, THE FIRM CONSIDERED THE IMPACT THAT THE CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK RATE HAD ON THE PREPAYMENT SPEED ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS WAS ASSESSED USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES AND OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES. THE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO BOTH

THE MSRS AND SFAS 133 DERIVATIVES WERE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME. WITH THE ELECTION TO APPLY FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING TO THE MSRS UNDER SFAS 156, SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGES 168169 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL

AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED UPON A 10% AND 20% VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR.

ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT MAGNIFY OR

PARTICIPANTS IN THE FIRMS STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS MAY HAVE SHARES WITHHELD TO COVER INCOME TAXES. THE SHARES WITHHELD AMOUNTED TO 2.7 MILLION, 8.1 MILLION AND

8.2 MILLION FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

ON APRIL 17, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT

AUTHORIZES THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE FIRMS COMMON SHARES, WHICH SUPERSEDES AN $8.0 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN 2006. THE $10.0 BILLION AUTHORIZATION INCLUDES SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED TO OFFSET ISSUANCES

UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS

CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION AND ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH

OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. DURING 2007,

2006 AND 2005, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 168 MILLION SHARES,

91 MILLION SHARES AND 94 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF COMMON STOCK UNDER STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, APPROXIMATELY 431 MILLION UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE OR DIRECTOR INCENTIVE, COMPENSATION, OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS.

NOTE 24  EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. BASIC EPS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS

COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHOD, FOR THE NUMERATOR, AS BASIC EPS BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES REFLECT, IN ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING SHARES, THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO

ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED INTO COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED EPS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE

FOR COMMON STOCK WERE NECESSARY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CALCULATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 26  INCOME TAXES

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH CLARIFIES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS 109. FIN 48 ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN, AND ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND

PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS AND DISCLOSURE. THE FIRM ADOPTED AND APPLIED FIN 48 UNDER THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS TO ALL OF ITS INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2007, RESULTING IN A $436 MILLION

CUMULATIVE EFFECT INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS, A REDUCTION IN GOODWILL OF $113 MILLION AND A $549 MILLION DECREASE IN THE LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES.

JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET-AND-LIABILITY METHOD REQUIRED BY SFAS 109 TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OR ASSET

FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED

PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT

COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES

BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THUS, THE FIRMS FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE CURRENTLY

REPORTED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND JANUARY 1, 2007, JPMORGAN CHASES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES, WAS

$4.8 BILLION AND $4.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $1.3 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS JPMORGAN CHASE IS PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAX AUTHORITIES, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007.

PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES AT JANUARY 1, 2007, IN ADDITION TO THE FIRMS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WAS $1.3 BILLION FOR INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF WHICH THE PENALTY COMPONENT WAS

INSIGNIFICANT. ACCRUED INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCREASED TO $1.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, DUE TO THE CONTINUING OUTSTANDING STATUS OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT LIABILITY, THE PENALTY COMPONENT OF WHICH REMAINS

INSIGNIFICANT.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX EXAMINATIONS BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE PRESENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FOR THE YEARS 2003, 2004 AND 2005. THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS

OF HERITAGE BANK ONE CORPORATION, WHICH MERGED WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE ON JULY 1, 2004, ARE UNDER EXAMINATION FOR THE YEARS 2000 THROUGH 2003, AND FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2004, THROUGH JULY 1, 2004. BOTH EXAMINATIONS ARE

EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE IN THE LATTER PART OF 2008. THE IRS AUDIT OF THE 2006 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN HAS NOT YET COMMENCED. CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS ARE PENDING WITH THE IRS RELATING TO PRIOR EXAMINATION PERIODS, FOR JPMORGAN

CHASE FOR THE YEARS 2001 AND 2002, AND FOR BANK ONE AND ITS PREDECESSOR ENTITIES FOR VARIOUS PERIODS FROM 1996 THROUGH 1999. FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2001, REFUND CLAIMS RELATING TO INCOME AND CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS, AND TO TAX ATTRIBUTE CARRYBACKS, FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS PREDECESSOR ENTITIES, INCLUDING BANK ONE, EITHER HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE FILED. ALSO, INTEREST RATE SWAP VALUATIONS BY A BANK ONE PREDECESSOR ENTITY FOR THE YEARS 1990 THROUGH 1993 ARE, AND HAVE BEEN, THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION IN

BOTH THE TAX COURT AND THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS.

TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES $367 MILLION OF TAX BENEFITS RECORDED IN 2006 AS A RESULT OF TAX AUDIT RESOLUTIONS.

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AS PRESCRIBED BY SFAS 52,

SFAS 115, SFAS 133 AND SFAS 158, AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. ALSO NOT REFLECTED ARE THE CUMULATIVE TAX EFFECTS OF INITIALLY IMPLEMENTING IN 2007, SFAS 157, SFAS 159 AND FIN 48,

AND IN 2006, SFAS 155, SFAS 156 AND SFAS 158. THE TAX EFFECTS OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS AN INCREASE IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $159 MILLION, $885 MILLION, AND $425 MILLION IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE

BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. FOR 2007, SUCH EARNINGS APPROXIMATED $1.4 BILLION ON A PRETAX BASIS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED $3.4

BILLION. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD RESULT UPON REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004,

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT CREATED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS AT A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY PROVIDING A

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON THE REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION PROVISION). THE DEDUCTION WAS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE

FIRM APPLIED THE REPATRIATION PROVISION TO $1.9 BILLION OF CASH FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS, RESULTING IN A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $55 MILLION. THE $1.9 BILLION OF CASH WAS INVESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN PURSUANT TO THE

GUIDELINES SET FORTH IN THE ACT.

THE TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WAS $60 MILLION, $(219)

MILLION AND $(536) MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 27  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE BUSINESS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.) IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

AND ITS DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC).

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD) REQUIRES DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION IN 2007 AND $2.2 BILLION IN 2006.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES

INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANYONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

AT JANUARY 1, 2008 AND 2007, JPMORGAN CHASES BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, $16.3 BILLION AND $14.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR

RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN 2008 WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $16.0 BILLION AND $8.6 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.4 BILLION AND $2.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 28  CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL INCLUDES COMMON

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS GOODWILL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS

TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ADJUSTED

ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD TO TAKE ACTION. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WERE OBLIGATED UNDER A NUMBER OF

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT USED PRIMARILY FOR BANKING PURPOSES. CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS OR ESCALATION CLAUSES PROVIDING FOR INCREASED RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED UPON MAINTENANCE, UTILITY AND TAX INCREASES OR

REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PERFORM RESTORATION WORK ON LEASED PREMISES. NO LEASE AGREEMENT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, ENGAGE IN DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS OR ENTER INTO FURTHER LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION (BNYM), FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BANK OF NEW YORK, HAS INFORMED THE FIRM OF

DIFFICULTIES IN LOCATING CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING IRS FORMS W-8 AND W-9, RELATED TO CERTAIN ACCOUNTS TRANSFERRED TO BNYM IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS SALE OF ITS CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS. THE FIRM COULD HAVE LIABILITY TO THE IRS IF IT

IS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH IRS TAX REPORTING AND WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS, AND TO BNYM IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE SALES AGREEMENTS. THE FIRM IS WORKING WITH BNYM TO LOCATE AND VERIFY DOCUMENTS, AND

TO OBTAIN REPLACEMENT DOCUMENTATION WHERE NECESSARY. THE FIRM AND BNYM HAVE JOINTLY NOTIFIED THE IRS OF THE MATTER AND ARE WORKING COOPERATIVELY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING REPORTING AND WITHHOLDING ISSUES WITH THE IRS.

ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY AMOUNTS PAYABLE WOULD BE MATERIAL, IT IS TOO EARLY TO PRECISELY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS MATTER.

LITIGATION RESERVE

INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WERE $36 MILLION, $512 MILLION AND $208 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. CHARGES RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE $2.8 BILLION IN 2005. THERE WERE NO CHARGES IN 2007 AND 2006 RELATED TO CERTAIN MATERIAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS LITIGATION RESERVES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS OUTSTANDING LITIGATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 5, JPMORGAN CHASE ACCRUES

FOR A LITIGATION-RELATED LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUCH A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WHEN THE FIRM IS NAMED A DEFENDANT IN A LITIGATION AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITY AND A JUDGMENT SHARING AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS NET OF AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE PAID BY OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE JUDGMENT SHARING AGREEMENT.

WHILE THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, IN LIGHT OF ALL INFORMATION KNOWN TO IT AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FIRMS LITIGATION

RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE AT SUCH DATE. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS LITIGATION RESERVES PERIODICALLY, AND THE RESERVES MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED IN THE FUTURE TO REFLECT FURTHER RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE

CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LITIGATION AND, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LITIGATION, INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY, LITIGATING OR SETTLING CASES ACCORDING TO MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS IN THE BEST

INTERESTS OF STOCKHOLDERS.

NOTE 30  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END USERS TO INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING

VARIABLE OR COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST RATE PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO IS AN END-USER OF DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO HEDGE MARKET

EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES. BOTH TRADING AND END-USER

DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 6 ON PAGE 122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES ARE UTILIZED IN THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. AS A RESULT OF INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BEING HEDGED ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET

THIS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION. INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCREASE OR DECREASE AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED

TO THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BEING HEDGED ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED-RATE AND VARIABLE-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL UNDERLYING NOTIONAL

AMOUNT. FORWARD CONTRACTS USED FOR THE FIRMS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY ARRANGEMENTS TO EXCHANGE CASH IN THE FUTURE BASED ON PRICE MOVEMENTS IN SECURITIES. FUTURES CONTRACTS USED ARE PRIMARILY INDEX FUTURES

PROVIDING FOR CASH PAYMENTS BASED UPON THE MOVEMENTS OF AN UNDERLYING RATE INDEX.

THE FIRM USES FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS CHANGE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE THE CURRENCY OF ONE COUNTRY FOR THE CURRENCY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY AT AN AGREED-UPON PRICE ON AN AGREED-UPON SETTLEMENT DATE.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE OVERALL PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS GOLD INVENTORY. AS A RESULT OF GOLD PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOLD INVENTORY

CHANGES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE GOLD INVENTORY BEING HEDGED ARE EXPECTED TO OFFSET THIS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION. FORWARD CONTRACTS USED FOR THE FIRMS GOLD INVENTORY RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE ARRANGEMENTS TO DELIVER GOLD IN THE FUTURE.

SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138, SFAS 149, AND SFAS 155, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE USED FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS. ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONTRACT IS FOR TRADING PURPOSES OR HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ORDER FOR A DERIVATIVE

TO BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THERE MUST BE DOCUMENTATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK EXPOSURE, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY

AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST

QUARTERLY. ANY INEFFECTIVENESS MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

168

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR

QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO

THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE ITEM AND CONTINUES TO BE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED OCCUR, CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE

THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENT ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, WAREHOUSE LOANS, AFS SECURITIES, MSRS AND GOLD INVENTORY. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE THE

MOST COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, CONVERTING FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A FLOATING-RATE. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 156, INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, SWAPTIONS AND FORWARDS WERE ALSO USED

IN COMBINATION WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS MSRS IN SFAS 133 HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 18 ON PAGES 154156 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALL AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME FOR LONG-TERM DEBT AND AFS SECURITIES; MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME FOR MSRS, OTHER INCOME FOR WAREHOUSE LOANS; AND PRINCIPAL

TRANSACTIONS FOR GOLD INVENTORY. THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2007, 2006 OR 2005 ON FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND

FOREIGN CURRENCYDENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS USED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON FUTURE EARNINGS. ALL AMOUNTS

AFFECTING EARNINGS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCYDENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF WHICH IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE PORTION OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

(FORWARD POINTS) IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, THE FIRM DID NOT ISSUE SHORT-TERM FIXED RATE CANADIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED NOTES DUE TO THE WEAK CREDIT MARKET FOR CANADIAN SHORT-TERM DEBT.

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT $263 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) OF NET LOSSES RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS ARE HEDGED IS 10 YEARS, AND SUCH TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY RELATE TO CORE LENDING AND BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE FIRMS ECONOMIC HEDGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO STANDARD CREDIT

DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133. SIMILARLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES USED AS

ECONOMIC HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS

OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW DOWN THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY

SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE

FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN WHOLESALE-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 138139 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006.

OTHER

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND ONLY WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS COMPLIED WITH PREDETERMINED

CONDITIONS, AND THEY GENERALLY EXPIRE ON FIXED DATES.

INCLUDED IN OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE COMMITMENTS TO INVESTMENT AND NONINVESTMENT GRADE

BORROWERS IN CONNECTION WITH LEVERAGED ACQUISITIONS. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THE ACQUISITION BY THE BORROWER IS SUCCESSFUL, TEND TO BE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND, IN MOST CASES, ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS BASED ON THE

BORROWERS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OTHER FACTORS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM OFTEN SYNDICATES PORTIONS OF THE INITIAL POSITION TO OTHER INVESTORS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE COMMITMENTS GENERALLY CONTAIN FLEXIBLE PRICING FEATURES TO

ADJUST FOR CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALTERNATIVELY, THE BORROWER MAY TURN TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS FOR REQUIRED FUNDING INSTEAD OF DRAWING ON THE COMMITMENT PROVIDED BY THE FIRM, AND THE COMMITMENT MAY EXPIRE UNUSED. AS SUCH, THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE FIRMS ACTUAL RISK AND THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT MAY NOT REFLECT ACTUAL FUTURE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF THESE COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $8.2 BILLION. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 4 AND NOTE 5 ON PAGES 111118 AND 119121, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FIN 45 GUARANTEES

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR

EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFFBALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45: CERTAIN ASSET

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.

THE FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN WHEN ISSUING THE GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS THAT QUALIFY UNDER FIN 45

IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS RECORDED THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE

CONTRACT, IT IS APPLIED TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. THE

AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO FIN 45 GUARANTEES RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $335 MILLION AND

$297 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT

GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE PRINCIPALLY USED AS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO SPES, PRIMARILY MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 146154 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. THE CONDUITS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT CAN REQUIRE THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO PERFORM UNDER THEIR ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CONDUIT AT ANY TIME. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE SPE AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE

THE ASSETS THEN FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON

THESE AGREEMENTS.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY JPMORGAN CHASE TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES,

BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE FIRM TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE GUARANTEES; IN

ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THESE GUARANTEES.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION

THROUGH THE FIRMS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM,

THE FIRM ISSUES SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO THE LENDER WHICH PROTECTS IT PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE THIRD-PARTY BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS

CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS

CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS OR RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF AN INDEMNIFIABLE DEFAULT BY A BORROWER OCCURS, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES

IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF.

ALSO, AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM INVESTS CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM THE

BORROWER IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED GUIDELINES. ON AN EXCEPTION BASIS THE FIRM MAY INDEMNIFY THE LENDER AGAINST THIS INVESTMENT RISK WHEN CERTAIN TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE MADE.

BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE RISKS OF LOSS ARE REMOTE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A

PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE; THUS, SUCH A

CLAUSE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TERMINATION CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. SEE BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (SOFTWARE

LICENSEES) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS), PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGE THAT MAY OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE

SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE

THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION

ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES 139145 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT CERTAIN SECURITIZED LOANS MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR

INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER SUCH REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION

PROVISIONS WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD BY SUCH SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE. THE POTENTIAL LOSS DUE TO

SUCH REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNITY IS MITIGATED BY THE DUE DILIGENCE THE FIRM PERFORMS BEFORE THE SALE TO ENSURE THAT THE ASSETS COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED ON SUCH

REPURCHASES AND/OR INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT, AND THEREFORE MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

THE FIRM IS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT VENTURE OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC (THE

JOINT VENTURE). THE JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 2005, AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT BY THE FIRM AND FIRST DATA CORPORATION, ITS JOINT VENTURE PARTNER, TO INTEGRATE THE COMPANIES JOINTLY OWNED CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND

PAYMENTECH MERCHANT BUSINESSES. THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDES MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS LIABLE PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT

OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. THE JOINT VENTURE IS CONTRACTUALLY LIABLE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., FOR THESE DISPUTED TRANSACTIONS. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED

IN THE CARDMEMBERS FAVOR, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBERS ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF THE JOINT VENTURE IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE

AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. THE JOINT VENTURE MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER

SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; (2) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER

REFUNDS; AND (3) THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HAVE A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO RECOVER

FROM ITS JOINT VENTURE PARTNER AN AMOUNT PROPORTIONATE TO SUCH PARTNERS EQUITY INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE JOINT VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $10 MILLION ON $719.1 BILLION OF

AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $779 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE JOINT VENTURE INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $9 MILLION ON $660.6 BILLION OF AGGREGATE

VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $893 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE JOINT VENTURE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS

CHARGEBACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS WOULD NOT BE DIFFERENT MATERIALLY FROM THE CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE; THEREFORE, THE FIRM HAS NOT RECORDED ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2007 ANNUAL REPORT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCHANGE, CLEARINGHOUSE AND CREDIT CARD ASSOCIATION GUARANTEES

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES,

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH

DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTY FUND, OR, IN A FEW CASES, THE

OBLIGATION MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED.

HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

THE FIRM IS AN EQUITY MEMBER OF VISA INC. DURING OCTOBER 2007, CERTAIN

VISA RELATED ENTITIES COMPLETED A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS TO COMBINE THEIR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING VISA USA, UNDER ONE HOLDING COMPANY, VISA INC. UPON THE RESTRUCTURING, THE FIRMS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN VISA USA WAS CONVERTED INTO

AN EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC. VISA INC. INTENDS TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES VIA AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND TO USE A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING TO REDEEM A PORTION OF THE FIRMS EQUITY INTEREST IN VISA INC.

PRIOR TO THE RESTRUCTURING, VISA USAS BY-LAWS OBLIGATED THE FIRM UPON DEMAND BY VISA TO INDEMNIFY VISA FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION OBLIGATIONS OF VISA. THE ACCOUNTING

FOR THAT GUARANTEE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER FIN 45 BECAUSE THE GUARANTEE WAS IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 45. UPON THE RESTRUCTURING EVENT, THE FIRMS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY VISA WAS LIMITED TO CERTAIN

IDENTIFIED LITIGATIONS. SUCH A LIMITATION IS DEEMED A MODIFICATION OF THE INDEMNITY BY-LAW AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS NOW SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 45. THE VALUE OF THE LITIGATION GUARANTEE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASED ON ITS FAIR VALUE; THE NET AMOUNT RECORDED (WITHIN OTHER LIABILITIES) DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A

GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED

DATE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES THAT EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON A COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS $85.3 BILLION AND $71.5

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS OR BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUE

RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OF $213 MILLION AND $230 MILLION, AND A DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $2.5 BILLION AND $987 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH SETTLEMENT AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR THE BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION TO OWN THE REFERENCE

ASSET. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45.

NOTE 32  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR

ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY

MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND BY

GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE LOAN PRODUCT WITH VARYING TERMS (E.G., INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS FOR AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD) OR EXPOSURE TO LOANS WITH HIGH

LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTE 33  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE BY MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC

AREA. THE FIRM DEFINES INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES AS BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE CUSTOMERS RESIDING OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., AND THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW IS BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE DOMICILE OF THE CUSTOMER OR THE LOCATION FROM WHICH THE

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP IS MANAGED. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE FIRMS U.S. OPERATIONS SERVE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.

AS THE FIRMS OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED, ESTIMATES AND

SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO APPORTION REVENUE AND EXPENSE BETWEEN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLOCATIONS USED FOR THE FIRMS SEGMENT REPORTING AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 34

ON PAGES 175177 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN

RELATION TO TOTAL ASSETS. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN THE U.S.

NOTE 34  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS  INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET MANAGEMENT, AS WELL

AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE SEGMENTS ARE BASED UPON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF

BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ON PAGES 3637 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION CONCERNING

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 3839 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

CAPITAL ALLOCATION CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM

REFINED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL (I.E., EQUITY) TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS REFINEMENT, RFS, CS, CB, TSS AND AM HAVE HIGHER AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THEM COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. THE REVISED

METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH BUSINESS SEGMENTS ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE MERGER. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE REVISED METHODOLOGY ASSIGNS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

SUPPORTING ACQUISITION-RELATED GOODWILL. AS PART OF THIS REFINEMENT IN THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY, THE FIRM ASSIGNED TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AN AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL EQUAL TO THE THEN-CURRENT BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL FROM AND PRIOR TO THE

MERGER. AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS, CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR 2005 IS NOT COMPARABLE TO SUBSEQUENT PERIODS AND CERTAIN BUSINESS METRICS, SUCH AS RETURN ON COMMON

EQUITY, ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS EQUITY CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION WITH THE BANK OF NEW YORK, SELECTED CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM TSS TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AND

REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS REPORTED.

(A)

THE AVERAGE YIELD WAS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AND DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS). YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF RELATED DERIVATIVES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE

USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(B)

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF STATE AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) OF

PRIVATE ISSUERS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

(C)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGE 134. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL

AGENCY OBLIGATIONS WAS $4.5 BILLION, U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS WAS $22.6 BILLION AND OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WAS $20.9 BILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY

OBLIGATIONS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WAS $77 MILLION. THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

(D)

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES MORTGAGED-BACKED SECURITIES

(MBSS) AND CMOS ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS FOR MBSS AND

CMOS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES WERE THE ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES EXCEEDED 10% OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

NONPERFORMING LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL TERMS HAD THEY BEEN PERFORMING AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THIS DATA FOR THE YEARS SPECIFIED. THE INCREASE FROM 2006 IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. BASED ON NEW RULES FROM THE FFIEC, BEGINNING IN 2006 SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE NOW ALLOCATED TO

A COUNTRY BASED UPON THE DOMICILE OF THE COUNTERPARTY; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE BASED UPON THE DOMICILE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITYS ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY, LOCAL FOREIGN OFFICE COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN COMMITMENTS; PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE

EXCLUDED FROM COMMITMENTS. PRIOR PERIOD DATA WERE NOT REVISED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

EXCEED 0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED

UNDER THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC METHODOLOGIES ARE: THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DERIVATIVES; NET LOCAL COUNTRY ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION); AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE

COUNTERPARTY, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY COLLATERAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF

EXPOSURE AT YEAR END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES EMERGING MARKETS CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE, SEE EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY EXPOSURE ON PAGE 83.
