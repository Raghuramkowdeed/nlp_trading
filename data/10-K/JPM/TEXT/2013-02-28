$2.4 TRILLION

IN ASSETS AND

$204.1 BILLION

IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY. UNDER THE J.P. MORGAN AND CHASE BRANDS, THE FIRM SERVES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. AND MANY OF THE WORLD’S MOST PROMINENT CORPORATE, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT CLIENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

”), A NATIONAL BANK WITH U.S. BRANCHES IN

23

STATES, AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“CHASE BANK USA, N.A.”), A NATIONAL BANK THAT IS THE FIRM’S CREDIT CARD–ISSUING BANK.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC (“JPMORGAN SECURITIES”), THE FIRM’S U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS. ONE OF THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (“U.K.”) IS

J.

P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC (FORMERLY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LTD.), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

THE FIRM’S WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM.

JPMORGAN CHASE

MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND OTHER SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO

FOUR

MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT. THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESS IS THE CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING SEGMENT. THE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING, AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENTS COMPRISE THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS PROVIDED IN THE “BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS” SECTION OF MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”), BEGINNING ON PAGE

64

AND IN NOTE 33 ON PAGES

326–329.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION AND PRICE. COMPETITION ALSO VARIES BASED ON THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS,

JPMORGAN CHASE

COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED AND, IN SOME CASES, FAILED. THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS LIKELY THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS COMPANIES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS GLOBALLY AND AS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OR MAY BECOME LARGER OR BETTER CAPITALIZED, THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES OR THAT OPERATE UNDER DIFFERENT RULES AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAN THE FIRM.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS.

REGULATORY REFORM

: ON JULY 21, 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”), WHICH IS INTENDED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THE DODD-FRANK ACT INSTRUCTS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO CONDUCT APPROXIMATELY 285 RULE-MAKINGS AND 130 STUDIES AND REPORTS. THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES INCLUDE THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE “CFTC”); THE

1

PART I

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”); THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE “FEDERAL RESERVE”); THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (THE “OCC”); THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE “FDIC”); THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION (THE “CFPB”); AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE “FSOC”). AS A RESULT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT RULE-MAKING AND OTHER REGULATORY REFORMS, THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE IN REGULATION AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY IN ASSESSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE REGULATORY CHANGES IT IS FACING, AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING ALL THE NEW REGULATIONS, WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, BEST MEETING THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, THE FIRM CANNOT CURRENTLY QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “RISK FACTORS” ON PAGES

8–21

. CERTAIN OF THESE CHANGES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”) AND STRESS TESTING

. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL RULES REGARDING THE SUBMISSION OF CAPITAL PLANS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE. PURSUANT TO THESE RULES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OCC ISSUED RULES REQUIRING THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OF ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO PERFORM STRESS TESTS UNDER ONE STRESS SCENARIO CREATED BY THE FIRM AS WELL AS THREE SCENARIOS (BASELINE, ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE) MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS TO THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CCAR AND STRESS TESTING” ON PAGES

5–6.

•

RESOLUTION PLAN.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED, PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE AND COMPANIES DESIGNATED AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BY THE FSOC TO SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC A PLAN FOR RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (A “RESOLUTION PLAN”). IN JANUARY 2012, THE FDIC ALSO ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE TO SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FDIC A PLAN FOR RESOLUTION UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE. THE TIMING OF INITIAL, ANNUAL AND INTERIM RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS UNDER BOTH RULES IS THE SAME. THE FIRM’S INITIAL RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS WERE FILED BY JULY 1, 2012, AND ANNUAL UPDATES WILL BE DUE BY JULY 1 EACH YEAR.

•

DERIVATIVES

. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FIRM WILL BE SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF ITS DERIVATIVES BUSINESS (INCLUDING CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE TRADED ON REGULATED TRADING PLATFORMS) AND HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION. FURTHER, SOME OF THE RULES FOR DERIVATIVES WILL APPLY EXTRATERRITORIALLY TO U.S. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH CLIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO REQUIRES BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURE THEIR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGING THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED.

•

VOLCKER RULE

. THE FIRM WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 619 OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROVISIONS PROHIBITING PROPRIETARY TRADING AND RESTRICTING THE ACTIVITIES INVOLVING PRIVATE EQUITY AND HEDGE FUNDS (THE “VOLCKER RULE”). ON OCTOBER 11, 2011, REGULATORS PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE. THESE ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN 2013. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULES, “PROPRIETARY TRADING” IS DEFINED AS THE TRADING OF SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES, OR FUTURES (OR OPTIONS ON ANY OF THE FOREGOING) AS PRINCIPAL, WHERE SUCH TRADING IS PRINCIPALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHORT-TERM RESALE, BENEFITING FROM ACTUAL OR EXPECTED SHORT-TERM PRICE MOVEMENTS AND REALIZING SHORT-TERM ARBITRAGE PROFITS. THE PROPOSED RULE’S DEFINITION OF PROPRIETARY TRADING SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES MARKET-MAKING-RELATED ACTIVITY, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT ISSUED SECURITIES TRADING AND CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM CEASED SOME PROHIBITED PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES DURING 2010 AND HAS SINCE EXITED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL SUCH ACTIVITIES.

•

MONEY MARKET FUND REFORM

. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FSOC AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (THE “FSB”) ISSUED SEPARATE PROPOSALS REGARDING MONEY MARKET FUND REFORM. PURSUANT TO SECTION 120 OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FSOC PUBLISHED PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE SEC PROCEED WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER POSSIBILITIES, REQUIRING THAT MONEY MARKET FUNDS ADOPT A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE, MANDATING A CAPITAL BUFFER AND REQUIRING A HOLD-BACK ON REDEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS. ON JANUARY 15, 2013, THE FSOC ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD EXTENDED THE COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SEC. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SEC WILL ISSUE ITS OWN RULE PROPOSAL ON MONEY MARKET FUND REFORM IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE FSB ENDORSED AND PUBLISHED FOR PUBLIC CONSULTATION 15 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS PROPOSED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF SECURITIES COMMISSIONS (“IOSCO”), INCLUDING REQUIRING MONEY MARKET FUNDS TO ADOPT A FLOATING NET ASSET VALUE. THE FSB HAS STATED THAT IT EXPECTS TO PUBLISH FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN SEPTEMBER 2013 AND, THEREAFTER, WORK ON PROCEDURES FOR THE

2

CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS.

•

CAPITAL

. THE TREATMENT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES WILL BE PHASED OUT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD, BEGINNING IN 2013. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FSB ANNOUNCED THAT CERTAIN GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (“GSIBS”) WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, ABOVE THE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY MINIMUM, IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 2.5%, DEPENDING UPON THE BANK’S SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND FDIC ISSUED FINAL RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING RATINGS ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPUTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS” ON PAGES

4–5.

•

FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND ASSESSMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE CHANGING THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENT RATE. THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 1, 2011, AND RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THE FIRM’S BANK SUBSIDIARIES PAY ANNUALLY TO THE FDIC. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2011, THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN ASSESSMENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “DEPOSIT INSURANCE” ON PAGE

6.

•

BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ESTABLISHED THE CFPB AS A NEW REGULATORY AGENCY. THE CFPB HAS AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE CFPB HAS EXAMINATION AUTHORITY OVER LARGE BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., WITH RESPECT TO THE BANKS’ CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE CFPB ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2014. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CFPB REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES” ON PAGE

7

AND “OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION” ON PAGES

7–8.

•

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATES A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND SUBJECTS THEM TO HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS” BELOW.

•

DEBIT INTERCHANGE.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ADOPTED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING THE “DURBIN AMENDMENT” PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH LIMIT THE AMOUNT THE FIRM CAN CHARGE FOR EACH DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION IT PROCESSES.

OTHER PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL APPLY TO NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, SUCH AS J.P.

MORGAN SECURITIES PLC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE “RISK FACTORS” ON PAGES

8–21.

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

: THE DODD-FRANK ACT CREATES A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SUBJECTS THEM TO HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING HEIGHTENED CAPITAL, LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT, RESOLUTION PLAN, SINGLE-COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMITS, AND EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS. SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL BE SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN ASSETS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CERTAIN NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT ARE DESIGNATED BY THE FSOC, WILL BE CONSIDERED SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUBJECT TO THE HEIGHTENED STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION.

IN ADDITION, IF THE REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE REGULATORS HAVE THE POWER TO REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN OF THESE HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING.

•

RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE OVERSIGHT OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT BY A STAND-ALONE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A CHIEF RISK OFFICER. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REVIEW AND APPROVE THE LIQUIDITY COSTS, BENEFITS, AND RISK OF EACH SIGNIFICANT NEW LINE OF BUSINESS AND PRODUCT.

•

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE A COMPANY TO CONDUCT A LIQUIDITY STRESS TEST AT LEAST MONTHLY.

•

STRESS TESTS.

STRESS TESTS WOULD BE CONDUCTED ANNUALLY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AND SEMI-ANNUALLY BY THE COMPANY.

•

SINGLE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE LIMITS.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIMIT NET CREDIT EXPOSURE OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A SINGLE COUNTERPARTY AS A PERCENTAGE OF REGULATORY CAPITAL. THERE WOULD BE A TWO-TIER COUNTERPARTY CREDIT LIMIT: (1) A GENERAL LIMIT THAT PROHIBITS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES) FROM HAVING AGGREGATE NET CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE UNAFFILIATED COUNTERPARTY (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES) IN EXCESS OF 25% OF THE COMPANY’S CAPITAL STOCK AND SURPLUS; AND (2) A MORE STRINGENT LIMIT BETWEEN A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH OVER $500 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS, AND ALL ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ANY COUNTERPARTY WITH OVER $500 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS, AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OF 10% OF THE COMPANY’S CAPITAL STOCK AND SURPLUS.

PART I

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

: JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000, PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. IF A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY OR ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANY’S DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST PROHIBIT THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS PROPOSED RULES UNDER WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL WEAKNESS, WHICH RESTRICTIONS COULD INCLUDE LIMITS ON ACQUISITIONS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE RESTRICTIONS, SEE “PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION AND EARLY REMEDIATION” ON PAGE

6.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE THEY MAY ACQUIRE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTING SHARES OF AN UNAFFILIATED BANK. PURSUANT TO THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994 (THE “RIEGLE-NEAL ACT”), THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY APPROVE AN APPLICATION FOR SUCH AN ACQUISITION WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAW OF ANY STATE, PROVIDED THAT THE ACQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANY, BEFORE OR AFTER THE ACQUISITION, DOES NOT CONTROL MORE THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR MORE THAN 30% (OR SUCH GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNTS AS PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW) OF THE TOTAL DEPOSITS OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACQUIRED BANK HAS ITS HOME OFFICE OR A BRANCH. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESTRICTS ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES IF, AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED 10% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES. FOR NON-U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANIES, LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED USING ONLY THE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF THEIR U.S. OPERATIONS. U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANIES MUST INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING ASSETS HELD OVERSEAS). THIS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF ALLOWING A NON-U.S. FINANCIAL COMPANY TO GROW TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN 10% OF THE U.S. MARKET WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE CONCENTRATION LIMIT. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FIRM MUST PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY WITH OVER $10 BILLION IN ASSETS THAT IS ENGAGED IN “FINANCIAL IN NATURE” ACTIVITIES.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

: FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY NATIONAL BANKS. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., AS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE, ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A “RECENT EARNINGS” TEST AND AN “UNDIVIDED PROFITS” TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT YEAR’S NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS, UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANK’S “UNDIVIDED PROFITS.” SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGE

306

FOR THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2013, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATOR’S OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION. UNDER PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DIVIDENDS ARE RESTRICTED ONCE ANY ONE OF THREE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS (TIER 1 COMMON, TIER 1 CAPITAL, OR TOTAL CAPITAL) FALLS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT (INCLUSIVE OF THE GSIB SURCHARGE) PLUS 2.5%.

MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED RULES REQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND RECEIVE A NOTICE OF NON-OBJECTION FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE TAKING CAPITAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS PAYING DIVIDENDS, IMPLEMENTING COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAMS OR REDEEMING OR REPURCHASING CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE “CCAR AND STRESS TESTING” ON PAGES

5–6.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

: FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO RISK-WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THESE GUIDELINES, SEE NOTE 28 ON PAGES

306–308.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS. THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 4% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS. THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (“BASEL I”). IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE ACCORD (“BASEL II”). THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE FINALIZED FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE ACCORD (“BASEL III”) WHICH NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES, INTRODUCED SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY COVERAGE AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AND ESTABLISHED AN INTERNATIONAL LEVERAGE RATIO. IN JUNE 2011, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED RULES TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT BASEL I FLOOR UNDER BASEL II/BASEL III CALCULATIONS. FOR FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, SEE PAGES

4–5.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009, U.S. BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY - SUCH AS PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. TIER 1 COMMON, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USED BY BANKING REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE QUALITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL WITH THE CAPITAL OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. THE FIRM USES TIER 1 COMMON ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION. IN JUNE 2012, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS REVISED, EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2013, CERTAIN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING POSITIONS AND SECURITIZATIONS (“BASEL 2.5”). FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

117–120.

IN JUNE 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FSB ANNOUNCED THAT GSIBS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, ABOVE THE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY MINIMUM, IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 2.5%, DEPENDING UPON THE BANK’S SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FSB ANNOUNCED THAT THE FIRM WOULD BE IN THE CATEGORY SUBJECT TO A 2.5% CAPITAL SURCHARGE. FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A DISINCENTIVE FOR BANKS FACING THE HIGHEST REQUIRED LEVEL OF TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY TO “INCREASE MATERIALLY THEIR GLOBAL SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE IN THE FUTURE,” AN ADDITIONAL 1% CHARGE COULD BE APPLIED. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE-MAKING THAT INCORPORATES THE CONCEPT OF A CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR GSIBS.

THE BASEL III REVISIONS GOVERNING THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PROLONGED OBSERVATION AND TRANSITION PERIODS.

THE TRANSITION PERIOD FOR BANKS TO MEET THE REVISED TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENT WERE TO BEGIN IN 2013, WITH IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GSIBS WILL BE PHASED-IN STARTING JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ONGOING RULE-MAKING PROCESS TO ASSESS BOTH THE TIMING AND THE IMPACT OF BASEL III ON ITS BUSINESSES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PROPOSED TWO NEW MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK: THE “LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO” AND THE “NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO,” WHICH ARE INTENDED TO MEASURE, OVER DIFFERENT TIME SPANS, THE AMOUNT OF LIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM. THE OBSERVATION PERIODS FOR BOTH THESE STANDARDS BEGAN IN 2011, WITH IMPLEMENTATION COMMENCING IN 2015 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROHIBITS THE USE OF EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS IN FEDERAL REGULATIONS. IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, OCC AND FDIC ISSUED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING RATINGS ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPUTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRM’S REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

117–120.

CCAR AND STRESS TESTING.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL RULES REGARDING THE SUBMISSION OF CAPITAL PLANS BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE. PURSUANT TO THESE RULES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED RULES REQUIRING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS TO PERFORM AN ANNUAL STRESS TEST AND REPORT THE RESULTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN JANUARY. THE RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL STRESS TEST WILL ALSO BE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED, AND WILL BE USED AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL OR WILL NOT OBJECT TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S CAPITAL PLAN. ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2013 CCAR PROCESS. THE FIRM’S PLAN RELATES TO THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2013 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 (THAT IS, THE 2013 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN RELATES TO DIVIDENDS TO BE DECLARED COMMENCING IN JUNE 2013 AND PAYABLE IN JULY 2013, AND TO COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASES AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIONS COMMENCING APRIL 1, 2013). THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FINAL RESPONSE TO ITS PLAN NO LATER THAN MARCH 14, 2013. IN REVIEWING THE CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONSIDER BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MEET SUPERVISORY EXPECTATION FOR MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIOS AND A BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 5% THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING HORIZON UNDER SEVERELY ADVERSE STRESS CONDITIONS OF THE STRESS TEST, EVEN IF THE FIRM DID NOT REDUCE PLANNED CAPITAL ACTIONS. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE PLAN, THE ASSUMPTIONS AND

5

PART I

ANALYSES UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN, AND ANY RELEVANT SUPERVISORY INFORMATION. IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS TO THE FIRM’S CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM WILL BE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MUST PERFORM AN ADDITIONAL STRESS TEST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THOSE RESULTS AS WELL. THE OCC ISSUED SIMILAR REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE NATIONAL BANKS WITH OVER $10 BILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS TO PERFORM ANNUAL STRESS TESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SEPARATE STRESS TESTS TO THE OCC FOR ITS NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED THAT THRESHOLD.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION AND EARLY REMEDIATION

: THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 REQUIRES THE RELEVANT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE “PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION” WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. WHILE THESE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST THE PARENT BANK HOLDING COMPANY, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., BASED ON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED STATUS OF ANY BANK SUBSIDIARY. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN FOR ITS UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY.

IN ADDITION, IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED PROPOSED RULES WHICH PROVIDE FOR EARLY REMEDIATION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL WEAKNESS. THESE PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS COULD INCLUDE LIMITS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, ACQUISITIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE

: THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN DEPOSITS, WHICH INSURANCE IS FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANKS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FDIC. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR INSURED DEPOSITS HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR TO $250,000 PER DEPOSITOR. IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED STRESS ON THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND CAUSED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE THE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY. AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE IN FEBRUARY 2011 THAT CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT BASE FROM INSURED DEPOSITS TO AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS LESS AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY, AND CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT RATE CALCULATION. THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 1, 2011, AND RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENTS THAT THE FIRM’S BANK SUBSIDIARIES PAY ANNUALLY TO THE FDIC. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2011, THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN ASSESSMENTS.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR THE FIRM

: UPON THE INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, THE FDIC WILL BE APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT. IN SUCH AN INSOLVENCY, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER.

•

TO TRANSFER ANY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE INSTITUTION’S CREDITORS;

•

TO ENFORCE THE INSTITUTION’S CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR

•

TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION IS A PARTY.

THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS “PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS”) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OR DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., SUCH PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. HOWEVER, THE U.K. FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (THE “FSA”) HAS RECENTLY ISSUED A PROPOSAL THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EITHER OBTAIN EQUAL TREATMENT FOR U.K. DEPOSITORS OR “SUBSIDIARIZE” IN THE U.K.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING “IN DEFAULT” OR “IN DANGER OF DEFAULT” (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “CROSS-GUARANTEE” LIABILITY). AN FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHERE A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, IS IN DEFAULT OR DANGER OF DEFAULT, THE FDIC MAY BE APPOINTED RECEIVER IN ORDER TO CONDUCT AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION OF SUCH SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE FDIC HAS ISSUED RULES TO IMPLEMENT ITS ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, AND IS EXPECTED TO PROPOSE ADDITIONAL RULES. THE FDIC HAS POWERS AS RECEIVER SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE. HOWEVER, THE DETAILS OF CERTAIN POWERS WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF ADDITIONAL RULE-MAKINGS AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY DELINEATED.

THE BANK SECRECY ACT

: THE BANK SECRECY ACT (“BSA”) REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING BANKS AND SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM. THE BSA INCLUDES A VARIETY OF RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS CASH AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING), AS WELL AS DUE DILIGENCE/KNOW-YOUR-CUSTOMER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH BSA REQUIREMENTS. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH THE OCC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE RELATING TO ITS BSA AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE

: THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACTS AS AN “UMBRELLA REGULATOR” AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE REGULATED BY THE OCC. SEE “OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION” ON PAGES

7–8

FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY SUPERVISION TO WHICH THE FIRM’S SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT.

HOLDING COMPANY AS SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES

: EFFECTIVE JULY 2011, PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT CODIFIED THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S HISTORICAL POLICY THAT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARY AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THESE SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

: THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LIMITS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 27 ON PAGE

306

. EFFECTIVE IN 2012, THE DODD-FRANK ACT EXTENDED SUCH RESTRICTIONS TO DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE DODD-FRANK ACT’S VOLCKER RULE IMPOSES SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND HEDGE FUNDS OR PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS FOR

WHICH THE BANKING ENTITY SERVES AS THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, INVESTMENT ADVISOR OR SPONSOR.

CFPB REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES

: THE CFPB ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2014 AND WHICH WILL PROHIBIT MORTGAGE SERVICERS FROM BEGINNING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL A MORTGAGE LOAN IS 120 DAYS DELINQUENT. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE BORROWER MAY APPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION OR OTHER OPTION AND THE SERVICER CANNOT BEGIN FORECLOSURE UNTIL THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. THE CFPB ISSUED ANOTHER FINAL REGULATION IN DECEMBER 2012 IMPOSING AN “ABILITY TO REPAY” REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. A CREDITOR (OR ITS ASSIGNEE) WILL BE LIABLE TO THE BORROWER FOR DAMAGES IF THE CREDITOR FAILS TO MAKE A “GOOD FAITH AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION OF A BORROWER’S REASONABLE ABILITY TO REPAY AS OF CONSUMMATION.” BORROWERS CAN SUE THE CREDITOR OR ASSIGNEE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS AFTER CLOSING, AND CAN RAISE AN ABILITY TO REPAY CLAIM AGAINST THE SERVICER AS A SET OFF AT ANY POINT DURING THE LOAN’S LIFE IF IN FORECLOSURE. A “QUALIFIED MORTGAGE” AS DEFINED IN THE REGULATION IS GENERALLY PROTECTED FROM SUCH SUITS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

: THE FIRM’S BANKS AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED “FUNCTIONAL REGULATORS” UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT). JPMORGAN CHASE’S NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A., ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANK’S BUSINESS AND CONDITION, STRESS TESTS OF BANKS AND IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, AMONG OTHER POWERS.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING, DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMILAR SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES SUBJECT TO LOCAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED BY J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC, WHICH IS REGULATED BY THE FSA. IT IS EXPECTED THAT, DURING 2013, REGULATION OF J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC WILL TRANSITION TO THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA), PURSUANT TO THE U.K. GOVERNMENT’S PLAN UNDER THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT 2012 TO RESTRUCTURE REGULATORY COMPETENCES AS BETWEEN THE PRA (WHICH WILL BE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVING RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRUDENTIAL REGULATION OF BANKS AND OTHER SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (WHICH WILL REGULATE PRUDENTIAL MATTERS FOR OTHER FIRMS AND CONDUCT MATTERS FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS).

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASE MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC, IN ADDITION TO THE SUPERVISION ALREADY DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS.

THE FIRM HAS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF FUTURES EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND ARE REGISTERED ACCORDINGLY.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TWO SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE EITHER REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS OR EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION. THESE CFTC-REGISTERED SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION. THE FIRM’S U.S. ENERGY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS GLOBALLY.

UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CFTC AND SEC WILL BE THE REGULATORS OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN VENTURES ENERGY CORPORATION HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS SWAP DEALERS. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC WILL ALSO REGISTER WITH THE SEC AS SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS.

THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THOSE NON-U.S. BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY, FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AND CARD ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATION AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CFPB WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RULE-MAKING AND ENFORCEMENT PURSUANT TO SUCH STATUTES.

UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRM’S POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARING OF NONPUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND OTHERS, AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, RETAIL CUSTOMERS ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO “OPT OUT” OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH THE MATERIAL RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

REGULATORY RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AND CAN RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES AND LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR CAN MAKE ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE FSOC, THE SEC, THE CFTC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE CFPB AND THE FDIC ARE ALL ENGAGED IN EXTENSIVE RULE-MAKING MANDATED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE RULE-MAKING REMAINS TO BE DONE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPLETE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND SUCH RULE-MAKING ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ON PAGES

1–8.

DEBIT INTERCHANGE

. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE “DURBIN AMENDMENT” PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT THE FIRM CAN CHARGE FOR EACH DEBIT CARD TRANSACTION, THE FIRM’S ANNUALIZED NET INCOME HAS BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION PER YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CONTINUES TO CONSIDER VARIOUS ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THIS REDUCTION IN NET INCOME, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY SUCH ACTIONS WILL WHOLLY OFFSET SUCH REDUCTION.

VOLCKER RULE

. UNTIL THE FINAL REGULATIONS UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE ARE ADOPTED, THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF PROHIBITED “PROPRIETARY TRADING”, THE SCOPE OF ANY EXCEPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO MARKET-MAKING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND THE SCOPE OF PERMITTED HEDGE FUND AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUND INVESTMENTS REMAIN UNCERTAIN. IT IS UNCLEAR UNDER THE PROPOSED RULES WHETHER SOME PORTION OF THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING-RELATED AND RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES, AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED, WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE CURTAILED OR WILL BE OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, THE RULES, IF ENACTED AS PROPOSED, COULD PROHIBIT THE FIRM’S PARTICIPATION AND INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES AND COULD BAR THE FIRM FROM SPONSORING OR INVESTING IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. FUNDS. ALSO, SHOULD REGULATORS NOT EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO HOLD CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN ILLIQUID PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, BEYOND THE MINIMUM STATUTORY

8

DIVESTMENT PERIOD, THE FIRM COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES WHEN IT DISPOSES OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. THE FIRM MAY BE FORCED TO SELL SUCH INVESTMENTS AT A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT IN THE SECONDARY MARKET AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE CONSTRAINED TIMING OF SUCH SALES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE LIKEWISE LIQUIDATING INVESTMENTS AT THE SAME TIME.

DERIVATIVES

. IN ADDITION TO IMPOSING COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION ON THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO REQUIRES BANKING ENTITIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, TO SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURE THEIR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGING THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH SUCH BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED. FURTHER, SOME OF THE RULES FOR SWAPS WILL APPLY EXTRATERRITORIALLY TO U.S. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS WITH CLIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. CLIENTS OF NON-U.S. FIRMS DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME RULES IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. THIS DISPARITY IN THE APPLICATION OF THE DIFFERENT RULES COULD PLACE JPMORGAN CHASE AT A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO ITS NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE EARNINGS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, JPMORGAN CHASE IS CONSIDERED TO BE A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND IS SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION. IF THE PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN DECEMBER 2011 ARE ADOPTED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED, THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT COSTS, AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CFPB

. THE CFPB HAS ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS REGARDING MORTGAGES WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2014 AND WHICH WILL PROHIBIT MORTGAGE SERVICERS FROM BEGINNING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL A MORTGAGE LOAN IS 120 DAYS DELINQUENT, AND WILL IMPOSE AN “ABILITY TO REPAY” REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. OTHER NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CFPB MAY PROMULGATE COULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN JPMORGAN CHASE’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES, RESULT IN INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT’S POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF THE AUTHORITY OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO BRING ACTIONS TO ENFORCE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION, THE FIRM COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL STATE LAWSUITS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THEREBY FURTHER INCREASING ITS LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.

RESOLUTION

. THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT PERIODICALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC A RESOLUTION PLAN UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE (A “RESOLUTION PLAN”). THE FDIC ALSO ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT REQUIRES THE FIRM TO SUBMIT PERIODIC CONTINGENCY PLANS TO THE FDIC UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT OUTLINING ITS RESOLUTION PLAN IN THE EVENT OF ITS FAILURE. THE FIRM’S INITIAL RESOLUTION PLAN SUBMISSIONS WERE FILED IN JULY

2012, AND UPDATES ARE DUE ANNUALLY. IF THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DETERMINE THAT THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN IS NOT CREDIBLE OR WOULD NOT FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY JOINTLY IMPOSE MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON THE FIRM, OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE GROWTH, ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO RESTRUCTURE, REORGANIZE OR DIVEST CERTAIN ASSETS OR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION. ANY SUCH MEASURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE AIMED AT THE DISAGGREGATION OF THE FIRM, MAY REDUCE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY, INCREASE THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGERIAL COSTS, LESSEN EFFICIENCIES AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE THE FIRM’S BUSINESS STRATEGIES.

IN ADDITION, HOLDERS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT OR PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY THE FIRM MAY BE FULLY SUBORDINATED TO INTERESTS HELD BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT THAT THE FIRM ENTERS INTO A RECEIVERSHIP, INSOLVENCY, LIQUIDATION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING.

CONCENTRATION LIMITS

. THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESTRICTS ACQUISITIONS BY FINANCIAL COMPANIES IF, AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANY WOULD EXCEED 10% OF THE TOTAL LIABILITIES OF ALL FINANCIAL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE RULES RELATED TO THESE PROVISIONS IN 2013. THIS CONCENTRATION LIMIT COULD RESTRICT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING ITS GROWTH PROSPECTS.

THE TOTAL IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT CANNOT BE FULLY ASSESSED WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOW NON-U.S. POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS RESPOND TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS UNDER THE ACT, AND HOW THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL AFFECT THE BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE FIRM, LIMIT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING, AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY SUCH NEW OR ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NON-U.S. REGULATIONS AND INITIATIVES MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR MAY CONFLICT WITH CURRENT OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH COULD CREATE INCREASED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER COSTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS OR PROFITABILITY.

THE EU HAS CREATED A EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD TO MONITOR FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND THE GROUP OF TWENTY FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS (“G-20”) BROADENED THE MEMBERSHIP AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY FORUM IN 2008 TO FORM THE FSB. THESE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH ARE

9

PART I

CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING WAYS TO PROMOTE CROSS-BORDER FINANCIAL STABILITY, ARE CONSIDERING VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THE INITIATIVES ADOPTED INCLUDE INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRADING INSTRUMENTS OR EXPOSURES AND COMPENSATION LIMITS ON CERTAIN EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES. IN THE U.K., REGULATORS HAVE INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING REGULATED U.K. SUBSIDIARIES OF NON-U.K. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BRANCHES OF NON-U.K. BANKS LOCATED IN THE U.K.; ADOPTED A BANK TAX LEVY THAT APPLIES TO BALANCE SHEETS OF BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES OF NON-U.K. BANKS; PROPOSED THAT NON-U.K. BANKS EITHER OBTAIN EQUAL TREATMENT FOR U.K. DEPOSITORS OR “SUBSIDIARIZE” IN THE U.K.; AND PROPOSED THE CREATION OF RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANS BY U.K. REGULATED ENTITIES, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES.

IN THE EU, THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX PROGRAM OF PROPOSED REGULATORY ENHANCEMENT WHICH REFLECTS, IN PART, THE EU’S COMMITMENTS TO POLICIES OF THE G-20 TOGETHER WITH OTHER PLANS SPECIFIC TO THE EU. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES THE EUROPEAN MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION (“EMIR”) WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WOULD REQUIRE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED DERIVATIVES AND WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE PHASED IN STARTING IN 2013. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE REVISION OF THE EXISTING MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE (“MIFID II”) TO DELIVER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE G20 COMMITMENT TO ON-VENUE TRADING OF DERIVATIVES. BOTH EMIR AND MIFID II INCLUDE MANY OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY HAVE WIDE-RANGING AND MATERIAL EFFECTS ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

THE EU IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONSIDERING SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS TO LAWS COVERING: DEPOSITARY ACTIVITIES; CREDIT RATING ACTIVITIES; RESOLUTION OF BANKS, INVESTMENT FIRMS AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES; ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING CONTROLS; DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN FINANCIAL FIRMS, TOGETHER WITH IMPLEMENTATION IN THE EU OF THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM IS MONITORING ANY POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ITS BUSINESS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN RELATION TO BOTH BANK STRUCTURE (IN RESPECT OF WHICH BOTH THE EU ITSELF AND A VARIETY OF EU MEMBER STATES UNILATERALLY ARE CONSIDERING NEW RULES) AND THE EU’S PLANS FOR A SINGLE SUPERVISORY MECHANISM FOR SYSTEMIC BANKS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.K. INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON BANKING (THE “VICKERS COMMISSION”) PROPOSED PROVISIONS, WHICH ARE NOW SET FORTH IN DRAFT LEGISLATION, THAT WOULD MANDATE THE SEPARATION (OR “RING-FENCING”) OF DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES FROM SECURITIES TRADING AND OTHER ANALOGOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN BANKS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. THE FINAL LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT AND INCLUDE THE SUPPLEMENTAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION ON BANKING STANDARDS (THE “TYRIE COMMISSION”) THAT SUCH RING-FENCES SHOULD BE “ELECTRIFIED” BY THE IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY FORCED SEPARATION ON BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF THE SAFEGUARDS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE FIRM WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE ABOVE-REFERENCED EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO “RING-FENCE,” BUT THIS CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL THE CRITERIA ARE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY.

PARALLEL BUT DISTINCT DRAFT PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE FRENCH AND GERMAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AT THE CURRENT TIME HOW THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS WILL AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, OR HOW EACH RELATE TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S FORTHCOMING LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ON BANK STRUCTURE ARISING OUT OF THE REPORT OF THE HIGH LEVEL EXPERT GROUP ON REFORMING THE STRUCTURE OF THE EU BANKING SECTOR (THE “LIIKANEN GROUP”). HOWEVER, AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORS MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR CONFLICT WITH REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT IN THE UNITED STATES (AS WELL AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD), THE FIRM MAY, IF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ADOPTED, BE SUBJECTED TO HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL COSTS, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER OPERATIONAL, CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.

THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ON THE FIRM THAT COULD DECREASE ITS COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE “BASEL COMMITTEE”) ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2010 REVISIONS TO ITS CAPITAL ACCORD; SUCH REVISIONS ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “BASEL III”. BASEL III WILL REQUIRE HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS, NARROW THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AND INTRODUCE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. IN JUNE 2012, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED PROPOSED CAPITAL RULES TO IMPLEMENT BASEL III.

CAPITAL SURCHARGE

. IN JUNE 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FSB PROPOSED THAT GSIBS BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ABOVE THE BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY MINIMUM. SEE PAGE

5

IN ITEM 1: BUSINESS, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSED CAPITAL CHANGE. BASED ON THE FIRM’S CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THESE NEW CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT IT WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE STANDARDS TO WHICH IT WILL BE SUBJECT AS THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE CAPITAL STANDARDS MAY REDUCE THE FIRM’S RETURN ON EQUITY OR CAUSE THE FIRM TO ALTER THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS IT OFFERS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, THEREBY CAUSING THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS ATTRACTIVE OR PLACING THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME CAPITAL SURCHARGE.

LIQUIDITY COVERAGE AND NET STABLE FUNDING RATIOS

. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ALSO PROPOSED TWO NEW MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK: THE “LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO” AND THE “NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO,” WHICH ARE INTENDED TO MEASURE, DURING AN ACUTE STRESS, OVER DIFFERENT TIME SPANS, THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUID ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM IN RELATION TO LIQUIDITY REQUIRED. IF THE RATIOS ARE FINALIZED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS TO RAISE LIQUIDITY AND TO TAKE CERTAIN MITIGATING ACTIONS, SUCH AS CEASING TO

10

OFFER CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS OR CHARGING HIGHER FEES FOR EXTENDING CERTAIN LINES OF CREDIT, IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH RATIOS. ACCORDINGLY, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE STANDARDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FUNDING COSTS OR REDUCE ITS PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.

ELIMINATION OF USE OF EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS

. THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE ISSUED FINAL RULES FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES WHICH ELIMINATE THE USE OF EXTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS FOR THE CALCULATION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CALCULATION OF THE FIRM’S RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE FIRM TO HOLD MORE CAPITAL, INCREASE ITS COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND PLACE THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO NON-U.S. COMPETITORS.

EXPANDED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES WILL INCREASE THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS AND MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT. THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS RELATING TO ITS BANK SECRECY ACT (“BSA”) AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (“AML”) POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM ALSO AGREED IN 2012 TO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH A NUMBER OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES. THE MORTGAGE-RELATED CONSENT ORDER AND GLOBAL SETTLEMENT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS AND PROVIDE CERTAIN REFINANCING AND OTHER BORROWER RELIEF, AS WELL AS TO ADHERE TO CERTAIN ENHANCED MORTGAGE SERVICING STANDARDS, AND THE BSA/AML CONSENT ORDER WILL REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCEDURES, MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ITS TECHNOLOGY AND HIRE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, ALL OF WHICH WILL INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.

NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CFPB MAY PROMULGATE COULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND PRACTICES OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES AND AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH BUSINESSES.

FINALLY, AS A RESULT OF INCREASING FEDERAL AND STATE SCRUTINY OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER PRACTICES, THE FIRM MAY FACE A GREATER NUMBER OR WIDER SCOPE OF INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND LITIGATION, THEREBY INCREASING ITS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO OR DEFENDING SUCH ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, INCREASED REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES, AND ANY REQUIRED CHANGES TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE, LIMIT THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THE FIRM OFFERS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, IMPOSE

ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON THE FIRM, CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT APPROPRIATELY COMPLY WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO ITS CONSUMER OPERATIONS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, OR MATERIAL REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN UNDER THE U.S. RESOLUTION PLAN RULES COULD MATERIALLY IMPAIR THE CLAIMS OF JPMORGAN CHASE DEBT HOLDERS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, IN JULY 2012 JPMORGAN CHASE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS INITIAL PLAN FOR RESOLUTION OF THE FIRM. THE FIRM’S RESOLUTION PLAN INCLUDES STRATEGIES TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, AND ALSO RECOMMENDS TO THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE FIRM’S PROPOSED OPTIMAL STRATEGY TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE SPECIAL RESOLUTION PROCEDURE PROVIDED IN TITLE II OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT (“TITLE II”).

THE FIRM’S RECOMMENDATION FOR ITS OPTIMAL TITLE II STRATEGY WOULD INVOLVE A “SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY” RECAPITALIZATION MODEL IN WHICH THE FDIC WOULD USE ITS POWER TO CREATE A “BRIDGE ENTITY” FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, TRANSFER THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND VIABLE PARTS OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY THE STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S MAIN OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE BRIDGE ENTITY, RECAPITALIZE THOSE BUSINESSES BY CONTRIBUTING SOME OR ALL OF SUCH INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS TO THE CAPITAL OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, AND BY EXCHANGING DEBT CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FOR EQUITY IN THE BRIDGE ENTITY. IF THE FIRM WERE TO BE RESOLVED UNDER THIS STRATEGY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE BRIDGE ENTITY DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOLDERS OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY OR SATISFY ALL OR PART OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF, AND INTEREST ON, THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH SUCH STOCK WAS EXCHANGED.

MARKET RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE HEALTH OF U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES.

IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS CAN AFFECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRM’S UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES; THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS; THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND,

11

PART I

THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS EXTENSIVE POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITIES AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS. THE FIRM MAY HAVE MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS, CREDIT SPREADS, AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUE RELATING TO ITS MARKET-MAKING AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL AFFECT PRICING OR THE ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES, AND THAT THIS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS.

THE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN SECURITIES MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S REVENUE. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRM’S FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS.

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET AND THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM EARNS FROM NET INTEREST INCOME. A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT OR A FLAT OR INVERTED YIELD CURVE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES BY COMPRESSING NET INTEREST MARGINS, REDUCING THE AMOUNTS THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR REDUCING THE VALUE OF ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”) ASSET, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER REVENUES.

THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. IF THE CURRENT POSITIVE TRENDS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY ARE NOT SUSTAINED, THIS COULD DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES OR PERSISTENT HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE FIRM’S EARNINGS.

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE FIRM TO BORROW ON BOTH A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS. CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN OR NARROW NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO FIRM-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS AND CONDITIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS WILL IMPACT, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FIRM’S EARNINGS ON LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

DESPITE IMPROVED FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS, MANY OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES FACING THE EUROZONE REMAIN AND PROBLEMS COULD RESURFACE WHICH COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

NOTWITHSTANDING IMPROVED FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS, MANY OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES FACING THE EUROZONE REMAIN AND PROBLEMS COULD RESURFACE WHICH COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IF THEY LEAD TO SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULT, SIGNIFICANT BANK FAILURES OR DEFAULTS AND/OR THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION (THE “EMU”).

THE ECB’S OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTION PROGRAM CONTINUES TO UNDERPIN AN IMPROVED RISK ENVIRONMENT, SHIFTING THE FOCUS OF THE CRISIS FROM IMMEDIATE FINANCING STRAINS TO THE MORE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES OF FISCAL RETRENCHMENT AND STIMULATION OF GDP GROWTH. HOWEVER, FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY WORSEN IF, FOR EXAMPLE, CONSECUTIVE EUROZONE COUNTRIES WERE TO DEFAULT ON THEIR SOVEREIGN DEBT, SIGNIFICANT BANK FAILURES OR DEFAULTS IN THESE COUNTRIES WERE TO OCCUR, AND/OR ONE OR MORE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EUROZONE WERE TO EXIT THE EMU. YIELDS ON GOVERNMENT BONDS OF CERTAIN EUROZONE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN, HAVE REMAINED VOLATILE, DESPITE VARIOUS STABILIZATION PACKAGES AND FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ASSIST VARIOUS DISTRESSED EUROZONE COUNTRIES. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE RAISED AS TO THE FINANCIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ASSISTANCE MEASURES TAKEN TO DATE AND SUCH CONCERNS COULD INTENSIFY. CONCERNS COULD ALSO BE TRIGGERED BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, WITH KEY ELECTIONS IN ITALY AND GERMANY DURING 2013, AND ONGOING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TOLERANCE OF AUSTERITY ACROSS THE EUROZONE.

CONTINUED ECONOMIC TURMOIL IN THE EUROZONE COULD LEAD TO A FURTHER DETERIORATION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE VARIOUS STEPS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN TO PROTECT ITS BUSINESSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AGAINST THE RESULTS OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

FURTHER, THE EFFECTS OF THE EUROZONE DEBT CRISIS COULD BE EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IF THEY LEAD TO A PARTIAL OR COMPLETE BREAK-UP OF THE EMU. THE PARTIAL OR FULL BREAK-UP OF THE EMU WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED AND ITS IMPACT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE EMU OR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE EMU COULD LEAD TO REDENOMINATION OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF OBLIGORS IN EXITING COUNTRIES. ANY SUCH EXIT AND REDENOMINATION WOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OF COUNTERPARTIES AND DEBTORS IN ANY EXITING COUNTRY, WHETHER SOVEREIGN OR OTHERWISE, AND LEAD TO COMPLEX AND LENGTHY DISPUTES AND LITIGATION. THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY AND

12

MARKET STRESS COULD ALSO CAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SEVERE DISRUPTION TO EQUITY MARKETS, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOND YIELDS GENERALLY, POTENTIAL FAILURE OR DEFAULT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE, A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN GLOBAL LIQUIDITY, A FREEZE-UP OF GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS AND A POTENTIAL WORLDWIDE RECESSION. ANY COMBINATION OF SUCH EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ONE OR MORE EMU EXITS AND CURRENCY REDENOMINATIONS COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY IMPOSITION OF CAPITAL, EXCHANGE AND SIMILAR CONTROLS, WHICH COULD FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT JPMORGAN CHASE’S CROSS-BORDER RISK AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESSES AND ITS EARNINGS. SEE “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT” ON PAGES

170–173

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S EUROPEAN EXPOSURES.

CHANGES ARE BEING CONSIDERED IN THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING LIBOR AND IT IS NOT APPARENT HOW ANY SUCH CHANGES COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF LIBOR-LINKED OBLIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE, OR HOW SUCH CHANGES COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BEGINNING IN 2008, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE CALCULATION OF THE DAILY LONDON INTER-BANK OFFERED RATE (“LIBOR”), WHICH IS CURRENTLY OVERSEEN BY THE BRITISH BANKERS’ ASSOCIATION (THE “BBA”). THE BBA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CHANGE THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING LIBOR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BANKS SURVEYED TO SET LIBOR AND TO STRENGTHEN THE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS. THE FINAL REPORT OF THE WHEATLEY REVIEW OF LIBOR, PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER 2012, SET FORTH RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO THE SETTING AND ADMINISTRATION OF LIBOR, INCLUDING THE GRADUAL PHASING OUT OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES AND MATURITIES. IN DECEMBER 2012 THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ADOPTED LEGISLATION ENACTING ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS, MAKING IT A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE THE SETTING OF BENCHMARK RATES. THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.K. FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (“FSA”) INTENDS TO INCORPORATE THE REST OF THE WHEATLEY REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS IN NEW REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE LIBOR PROCESS.

AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS UNCERTAIN THE EXTENT OF CHANGES, IF ANY, MAY BE REQUIRED OR MADE BY THE FSA OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING LIBOR. ACCORDINGLY, AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS NOT APPARENT WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT ANY SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF ANY LIBOR-LINKED DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE FIRM OR ANY LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS AN OBLIGOR, OR WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT ANY SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF ANY LIBOR-LINKED SECURITIES, LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT HELD BY OR DUE TO THE FIRM, OR ON THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CREDIT RISK

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF THE CURRENT POSITIVE ECONOMIC TRENDS GLOBALLY ARE NOT SUSTAINED, MORE OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S CUSTOMERS MAY BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR IN REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASE ASSETS FROM OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING TO ITS CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF THE FIRM’S COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS IN THE MARKET ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY, THEREBY EXACERBATING THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES (INCLUDING MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES) THAT THE FIRM COULD INCUR IN ITS MARKET-MAKING AND CLEARING BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF MARKET-MAKING, TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK AND, IN SOME CASES, DISPUTES AND LITIGATION IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT.

DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS OR ILLIQUIDITY, THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE FIRM CANNOT REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT OR WHEN COLLATERAL IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO THE FIRM. FURTHER, DISPUTES WITH OBLIGORS AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY COULD PRODUCE LOSSES IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRM’S INABILITY TO SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE THE VALUE OF ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRM’S POSITIONS MAY NOT ONLY INCREASE THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASE

13

PART I

THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ROLE AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE BUSINESS EXPOSES IT TO CREDIT RISKS, INCLUDING INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK.

THE FIRM IS A MARKET LEADER IN PROVIDING CLEARING, CUSTODIAL AND PRIME BROKERAGE SERVICES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ACTS AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT AND, IN THE CASE OF ITS ROLE IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE BUSINESS, CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF THE CASH BORROWERS, USUALLY BROKER-DEALERS; HOWEVER, THIS EXPOSURE IS SECURED BY COLLATERAL AND TYPICALLY EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS BY THE END OF THE DAY. THE FIRM ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE TRI-PARTY REPO INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM TASK FORCE SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK, WHICH ISSUED RECOMMENDATIONS TO MODIFY AND IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MITIGATE INTRA-DAY CREDIT EXPOSURE. THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THE INTRA-DAY CREDIT RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE END OF 2013. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM EXPECTS ITS INTRA-DAY CREDIT EXPOSURE AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. NEVERTHELESS, IF A BROKER-DEALER THAT IS PARTY TO A REPURCHASE TRANSACTION CLEARED BY THE FIRM BECOMES BANKRUPT OR INSOLVENT, THE FIRM MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN DISPUTES AND LITIGATION WITH THE BROKER-DEALER’S BANKRUPTCY ESTATE AND OTHER CREDITORS, OR INVOLVED IN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, ALL OF WHICH CAN INCREASE THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL AND LITIGATION COSTS AND MAY RESULT IN LOSSES IF THE SECURITIES IN THE REPURCHASE TRANSACTION DECLINE IN VALUE.

LIQUIDITY RISK

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE OTHERWISE EXPERIENCING DISRUPTION, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (“SPES”) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN SELLING OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IF THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO STABLE AND LOW COST SOURCES OF FUNDING, SUCH AS BANK DEPOSITS, ARE REDUCED, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO RAISE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING WHICH MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE OR OF LIMITED AVAILABILITY.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH FLOW AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION OR CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD REDUCE ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

SOME REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING LARGE BANKS TO INCORPORATE A SEPARATE SUBSIDIARY IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY FOR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. IF ADOPTED, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD HINDER THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE ITS FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER.

REDUCTIONS IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY AND COST OF FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ARE CURRENTLY RATED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. IN 2012, MOODY’S AND FITCH DOWNGRADED THE RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IN ADDITION, AS OF YEAR-END 2012, MOODY’S HAD JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., AND S&P HAD JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, ON “NEGATIVE” OUTLOOK, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A FURTHER DOWNGRADE IN RATINGS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RATING AGENCIES, HAVE INDICATED THAT FURTHER CONTROL FAILURES BY THE FIRM (SUCH AS WAS EVIDENCED IN THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”) MATTER DISCUSSED BELOW), DETERIORATION IN CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND ASSET QUALITY LEVELS, OR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RISK APPETITE COULD PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE FIRM’S RATINGS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY INTEND TO RE-EVALUATE THE CREDIT RATINGS OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN LIGHT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT THAT SEEK TO ELIMINATE ANY IMPLICIT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SUCH INSTITUTIONS.

FURTHERMORE, THE RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN CREDITWORTHINESS, ELEVATED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND HIGHER FUNDING SPREADS, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO DOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF GLOBAL BANKS, INCLUDING THE FIRM. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DOWNGRADES FROM RATING AGENCIES, IF THEY AFFECTED THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS, WOULD NOT OCCUR AT TIMES OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY WHEN THE

14

FIRM’S OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS MAY BE MORE LIMITED AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

FURTHER, A REDUCTION IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS, MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING DEBT, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY CURTAILING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCH REDUCTION IN CREDIT RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT SPREADS CHARGED BY THE MARKET FOR TAKING CREDIT RISK ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE ISSUED OR MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE.

LEGAL RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT LITIGATION WITH PRIVATE PARTIES WILL NOT INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. ACTIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IN 2012, THE FIRM WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONSENT ORDERS FROM ITS BANKING REGULATORS AND ENTERED INTO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES RELATING TO ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FIRM ALSO ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS RELATED TO RISK MANAGEMENT, MODEL GOVERNANCE AND OTHER CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CIO AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AT THE FIRM AND WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRM’S AND CERTAIN OF ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES’ POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS RELATING TO COMPLIANCE WITH BSA AND AML REQUIREMENTS. AS THE REGULATORS CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM AND ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL CONSENT ORDERS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ISSUED BY THEM IN THE FUTURE. THESE AND OTHER INITIATIVES FROM FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FURTHER JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES, OR CAUSE THE FIRM TO BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL ISSUES, OR HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRM’S REVENUE.

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES) ARE BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES ON THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND MARKET-MAKING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH SUCH COMPANIES OPERATE, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS AND CONSIDERATIONS AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS OR MAY CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THOSE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS. AS NOTED ABOVE, CONCERNS REGARDING THE FISCAL CONDITION OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EUROZONE CONTINUE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH CONCERNS WILL NOT LEAD TO “MARKET CONTAGION” BEYOND THOSE COUNTRIES IN THE EUROZONE OR BEYOND THE EUROZONE. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY MAY BE HINDERED BY LOCAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPANDED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GROW, ITS INTERNATIONAL WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IN EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA (“EMEA”), ASIA/PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA/CARIBBEAN. AS PART OF ITS INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY, THE FIRM SEEKS TO PROVIDE A WIDER RANGE OF

15

PART I

FINANCIAL SERVICES TO ITS CLIENTS THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THOSE REGIONS AND TO EXPAND ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE INTENDS TO GROW ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES HAVE ECONOMIES OR MARKETS THAT ARE LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE VOLATILE, AND MAY HAVE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE LESS ESTABLISHED OR PREDICTABLE, THAN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS IN WHICH THE FIRM CURRENTLY OPERATES. SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS, OR HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICIES SUCH AS CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THESE COUNTRIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO, SOCIAL UNREST, GENERAL STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES, OVERTHROW OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER FORMS OF INTERNAL DISCORD, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRIES. POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OR DISLOCATION IN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES CAN HINDER THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THOSE OPERATIONS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ITS INTERNATIONAL GROWTH INITIATIVES.

LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES CAN ALSO HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY BASIS OR GUIDANCE FOR ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS OR TRANSACTIONS, OR THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OR INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; DIFFICULTY IN COMPETING IN ECONOMIES IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS OR PROTECTS ALL OR A PORTION OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY OR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES, OR WHERE GRAFT OR CORRUPTION MAY BE PERVASIVE; AND THE THREAT OF ARBITRARY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, CIVIL LITIGATIONS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS INCLUDING EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS

OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES OFTEN REQUIRES THE FIRM TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UNDERSTANDING, AND MONITORING CHANGES IN, LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING RELATED INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL ALWAYS BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS PREDICTABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM CAN ALSO INCUR HIGHER COSTS, AND FACE GREATER COMPLIANCE RISKS, IN STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO COMPLY WITH U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOAN REPURCHASE AND INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS (WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT RECOURSE), THE ORIGINATOR IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A VARIETY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BOTH THE ORIGINATOR AND THE LOANS BEING SOLD OR SECURITIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS, AND THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WHEN IT SECURITIZES LOANS IT HAS ORIGINATED. IF A LOAN THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IS SOLD OR SECURITIZED, THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN AND INCUR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS DIRECTLY, OR THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSSES. SINCE 2010, THE COSTS OF REPURCHASING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES (“GSES”), SUCH AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, HAVE BEEN ELEVATED, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH COSTS WILL NOT CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY, REPURCHASE OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO THE GSES OR TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM RECORDS WITH RESPECT TO ITS LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS TO THE GSES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS MADE BY PURCHASERS, THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPURCHASES DEMANDS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE, THE FIRM’S POTENTIAL ABILITY TO RECOVER CERTAIN LOSSES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, AND THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURERS AND OTHER PARTIES. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT REPURCHASE LIABILITY RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE, THE FACTORS REFERRED TO ABOVE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON THE GSES’ FUTURE BEHAVIOR, THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RESERVES WILL NOT BE INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES LITIGATION RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS NOT SOLD TO THE GSES. THE

16

FIRM SEPARATELY EVALUATES ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH LITIGATION IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESERVES IN RESPECT OF SUCH LITIGATION MATTERS ARE ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RESERVES WILL NOT NEED TO BE INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ENSURING THAT IT SATISFIES REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO MORTGAGE SERVICING AND FORECLOSURES.

THE FIRM HAS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, ENTERED INTO THE CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS RELATING TO ITS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES, AND AGREED TO THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EFFORTS TO ENHANCE ITS MORTGAGE ORIGINATION, SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE ENHANCEMENTS REQUIRED UNDER THE CONSENT ORDERS AND THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE GSES IMPOSE COMPENSATORY FEES ON THEIR MORTGAGE SERVICERS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, IF SUCH SERVICERS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE FORECLOSURE TIMETABLES MANDATED BY THE GSES, AND SUCH FEES MAY CONTINUE TO BE IMPOSED ON THE FIRM IN THE FUTURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION AND HAS INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY, AND TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES FROM THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. FURTHERMORE, LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS.

THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY

OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE FIRM’S CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE FIRM’S ACTIONS TO MITIGATE ITS RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OR MORE OF ITS EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF THE SYSTEMS OR MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PARTIES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM CHANGES PROCESSES OR INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE FIRM’S POSSESSION WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER THROUGH THE FAULT OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRM’S CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY BREACHES (AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW); ELECTRICAL OR

17

PART I

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES; FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS, INCLUDING STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESILIENCY PLANS ARE BOTH SUFFICIENT AND ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PLANS WILL FULLY MITIGATE ALL POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS TO THE FIRM. ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SUBJECTING THE FIRM TO LOSSES OR LIABILITY, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE FAILURE OR DISRUPTION, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

A BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S SYSTEMS COULD DISRUPT ITS BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE ITS REPUTATION AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND LEGAL EXPOSURE FOR THE FIRM.

ALTHOUGH JPMORGAN CHASE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPGRADE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION BELONGING TO THE FIRM AND ITS CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES WILL PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS AND COMPANIES ENGAGED IN DATA PROCESSING HAVE REPORTED BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF THEIR WEBSITES OR OTHER SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE INVOLVED SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED ATTACKS INTENDED TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISABLE OR DEGRADE SERVICE, OR SABOTAGE SYSTEMS, OFTEN THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALWARE, CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER MEANS. THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH WERE INTENDED TO DISRUPT CONSUMER ONLINE BANKING SERVICES.

DESPITE THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ITS SYSTEMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES OF THESE TYPES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE SECURITY ATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE THE FIRM SUCH AS PERSONS WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR WHO MAY BE LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THOSE PARTIES MAY ALSO

ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR OTHER USERS OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE FIRM’S DATA OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS MOBILE-PAYMENT AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANDS ITS INTERNAL USAGE OF WEB-BASED PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS.

A SUCCESSFUL PENETRATION OR CIRCUMVENTION OF THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRM, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS, OR DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS OR SYSTEMS OF THE FIRM AND THOSE OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE FIRM OR TO ITS CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM’S SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION EXPOSURE, AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.’S COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION EFFORTS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS OR RESULTS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH INTEGRATION EFFORTS WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN THE DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S ONGOING BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, DEPOSITORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS.

RISK MANAGEMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS AND ITS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET

18

RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, COUNTRY RISK, PRINCIPAL RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, AND REPUTATIONAL RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES CHANGE AND GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR MANAGED. IN ADDITION, IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES, LENDING COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE, AS WELL AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK. AS ONE OF THE NATION’S LARGEST LENDERS, THE FIRM HAS EXPOSURES ARISING FROM ITS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS EARNINGS. THE FIRM ESTABLISHES ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE, INCLUDING UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM’S BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT SUCH AS A DERIVATIVE. CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS

WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES. IN PARTICULAR, DISPUTES REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, AND IMPAIR THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OR TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT’S SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ITS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE REPORTED LOSSES IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGED BY CIO, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 CIO’S RISK MANAGEMENT HAD BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE GROWTH IN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE PORTFOLIO DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. AMONG OTHER MATTERS, THE FIRM’S INTERNAL REVIEW FOUND THAT CIO LACKED A ROBUST RISK COMMITTEE STRUCTURE; THAT CIO’S RISK LIMITS WERE INSUFFICIENTLY GRANULAR AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN REASSESSED IN LIGHT OF THE POSITIONS BEING ADDED TO THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012; THAT CIO RISK MANAGEMENT WAS INSUFFICIENTLY ENGAGED IN THE APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 OF A NEW CIO VALUE-AT-RISK (“VAR”) MODEL RELATED TO THE PORTFOLIO (BEFORE THAT MODEL WAS DISCONTINUED AND THE PREVIOUS MODEL WAS RESTORED); AND THAT THERE WAS INADEQUATE ESCALATION TO THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT OF CERTAIN RISK ISSUES RELATING TO THE PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CORRECT SUCH LAPSES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, APPOINTING A NEW CHIEF RISK OFFICER FOR CIO/TREASURY/CORPORATE (“CTC”); ADDING RESOURCES AND TALENT IN CIO RISK MANAGEMENT; INSTITUTING NEW CTC RISK COMMITTEES TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE AND CONTROLS AND ENSURE TIGHTER LINKAGES BETWEEN CIO, TREASURY AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR; AND INTRODUCING MORE GRANULAR RISK LIMITS FOR CIO.

19

PART I

IN JANUARY 2013, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER WITH THE OCC RELATING TO THE BANKING REGULATORS’ REVIEWS OF THE CIO MATTER. THESE CONSENT ORDERS RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT, MODEL GOVERNANCE AND OTHER CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CIO AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AT THE FIRM. MANY OF THE ACTIONS REQUIRED BY THE CONSENT ORDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN, OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING, IMPLEMENTED BY THE FIRM.

WHILE THE FIRM HAS TAKEN, AND IS TAKING, STEPS TO CORRECT THE LAPSES IN THE CIO RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT NEW OR ADDITIONAL LAPSES IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUCH LAPSES OR OTHER INADEQUACIES IN THE DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE, PROCEDURES OR PRACTICES COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE FIRM, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE ANY RISK MANAGEMENT DEFICIENCY, ATTRACT HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

LAPSES IN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, PROFITABILITY OR REPUTATION.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. NEVERTHELESS, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME. ON JULY 13, 2012, THE FIRM REPORTED THAT IT HAD DETERMINED THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTED IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT MARCH 31, 2012. THIS DETERMINATION RELATED TO THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION FOR THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGED BY CIO DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. AS A RESULT OF THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRM’S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AT MARCH 31, 2012. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO REMEDIATE THE INTERNAL CONTROL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING ENHANCING MANAGEMENT SUPERVISION OF VALUATION MATTERS. THE CONTROL DEFICIENCY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY REMEDIATED BY JUNE 30, 2012, AND WAS CLOSED-OUT BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2012.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM’S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN THE FUTURE OR THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN. ANY SUCH LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

CORRECT THE LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT IT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

OTHER RISKS

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRM’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPETITORS OF THE FIRM’S NON-U.S. WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REGULATORY OBJECTIVES UNDERLYING SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE AND THE DERIVATIVES “PUSH-OUT” RULES, HAVE NOT BEEN EMBRACED BY GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED INTO LAW IN MOST COUNTRIES. THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, CAN PUT THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO ITS NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING

20

PROHIBITING THE FIRM FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE FIRM’S PRICING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE FIRM’S COST STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE THE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS, AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRM’S MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON THE FIRM OR ITS EMPLOYEES OF RESTRICTIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES, MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AND RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, OR A FAILURE OR

PERCEIVED FAILURE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS FAIRLY, CAN RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST REVENUE, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND HARM TO THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. ADVERSE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRM’S PROSPECTS. ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRM’S REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OCCUR, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING RISE TO THE REPUTATIONAL HARM COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRM’S CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH THE FIRM, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ITS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE. SEE EXHIBITS 31.1 AND 31.2 FOR THE CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

THE FIRM IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS

JPMORGAN CHASE

, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DEFICIENCIES WILL NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THE FUTURE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING” ON PAGE

186

. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE

THREE MONTHS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

ITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION

PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012, WHICH ADDED SECTION 13(R) TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE “EXCHANGE ACT”), AN ISSUER IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN ITS ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY REPORTS, AS APPLICABLE, WHETHER IT OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES KNOWINGLY ENGAGED IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS RELATING TO IRAN OR WITH INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVE ORDERS. DISCLOSURE IS GENERALLY REQUIRED EVEN WHERE THE ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS WERE CONDUCTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

CARLSON WAGONLIT TRAVEL (“CWT”), A BUSINESS TRAVEL MANAGEMENT FIRM IN WHICH

JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS INVESTED THROUGH ITS MERCHANT BANKING ACTIVITIES, MAY BE DEEMED TO BE AN AFFILIATE OF THE FIRM, AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 12B-2. CWT HAS INFORMED THE FIRM THAT, DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, IT BOOKED APPROXIMATELY 30 FLIGHTS (OF THE APPROXIMATELY 59 MILLION TRANSACTIONS IT BOOKED IN

2012

) TO IRAN ON IRAN AIR FOR PASSENGERS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.

CWT AND THE FIRM BELIEVE THAT THIS ACTIVITY IS PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM U.S. SANCTIONS FOR TRAVEL-RELATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT, AS AMENDED. CWT HAD APPROXIMATELY $27,000 IN GROSS REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE TRANSACTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

(A)

RESULTS FOR 2008 INCLUDED A CONFORMING LOAN LOSS PROVISION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK’S (“WASHINGTON MUTUAL”) BANKING OPERATIONS.

(B)

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED THE BANKING OPERATIONS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL. THE ACQUISITION RESULTED IN NEGATIVE GOODWILL, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM RECORDED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAIN. A PRELIMINARY GAIN OF $1.9 BILLION WAS RECOGNIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE FINAL TOTAL EXTRAORDINARY GAIN THAT RESULTED FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WAS $2.0 BILLION.

(C)

THE CALCULATION OF 2009 EARNINGS PER SHARE (“EPS”) AND NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON EQUITY INCLUDES A ONE-TIME, NONCASH REDUCTION OF

$1.1 BILLION

, OR

$0.27

PER SHARE, RESULTING FROM REPAYMENT OF U.S. TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (“TARP”) PREFERRED CAPITAL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. EXCLUDING THIS REDUCTION, THE ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE WERE

7%

AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2009. THE FIRM VIEWS THE ADJUSTED ROE AND ROTCE, BOTH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEY ENABLE THE COMPARABILITY TO PRIOR PERIODS.

(D)

TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AND ROTCE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY DIVIDED BY PERIOD-END COMMON SHARES. ROTCE MEASURES THE FIRM’S ANNUALIZED EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE MEASURES, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ON PAGES

76–77

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

(E)

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

THE EUROZONE CRISIS WAS CENTER STAGE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, WITH SOCIAL STRESSES AND FEARS OF BREAKUP OF THE EURO. HOWEVER, STRONG STANDS BY EUROZONE STATES AND THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (“ECB”) HELPED STABILIZE THE EUROZONE LATER IN THE YEAR. THE ECB’S OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONS (“OMT”) PROGRAM SHOWED ITS COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE A SAFETY NET FOR EUROPEAN NATIONS. EUROZONE MEMBER STATES ALSO TOOK CRUCIAL STEPS TOWARD FURTHER FISCAL INTEGRATION BY HANDING OVER POWER TO THE ECB TO REGULATE THE LARGEST BANKS IN THE EURO AREA AND BY PASSING MORE BUDGETARY AUTHORITY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. DESPITE THE EASING OF THE CRISIS, THE ECONOMIES OF MANY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES STALLED IN 2012.

ASIA’S DEVELOPING ECONOMIES CONTINUED TO EXPAND IN 2012, ALTHOUGH GROWTH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, REDUCING GLOBAL INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.

IN THE U.S., THE ECONOMY GREW AT A MODEST PACE AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINED TO A FOUR YEAR LOW OF 7.8% BY THE END OF 2012 AS U.S. LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE. THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET TURNED THE CORNER DURING 2012 AS THE SECTOR CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT: EXCESS INVENTORIES WERE REDUCED, PRICES BEGAN TO RISE AND HOME AFFORDABILITY IMPROVED IN MOST AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AS HOUSEHOLD INCOMES STABILIZED AND MORTGAGE RATES DECLINED TO HISTORIC LOWS. HOMEBUILDER CONFIDENCE IMPROVED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN SIX YEARS AND HOUSING STARTS INCREASED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN FOUR YEARS DURING 2012. AT THE SAME TIME, INFLATION REMAINED BELOW THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM’S (THE “FEDERAL RESERVE”) 2% LONG-RUN GOAL.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAINTAINED THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT ZERO TO ONE QUARTER PERCENT AND TIED THE INTEREST RATE FORECASTS TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY, IN PARTICULAR INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED A NEW ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE OPEN-ENDED AND IS INTENDED TO SPEED UP THE PACE OF THE U.S. ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PRODUCE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR MARKET.

FINANCIAL MARKETS REACTED FAVORABLY WHEN THE U.S. CONGRESS REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE SO-CALLED “FISCAL CLIFF” BY PASSING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012. THIS ACT MADE PERMANENT MOST OF THE TAX CUTS INITIATED IN 2001 AND 2003 AND ALLOWED THE TAX RATE ON THE TOP INCOME BRACKET, WHICH WAS INCREASED TO $450,000 ANNUALLY FOR

JOINT TAX FILERS, TO REVERT TO 39.6% FROM 35.0%. SPENDING AND DEBT CEILING ISSUES WERE POSTPONED INTO 2013.

GOING INTO 2013, THE U.S. ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EUROPE’S FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S MONETARY POLICY, AND THE ONGOING FISCAL DEBATE OVER THE U.S. DEBT LIMIT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTED FULL-YEAR 2012 RECORD NET INCOME OF $21.3 BILLION, OR $5.20 PER SHARE, ON NET REVENUE OF $97.0 BILLION. NET INCOME INCREASED BY $2.3 BILLION, OR 12%, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $19.0 BILLION, OR $4.48 PER SHARE, IN 2011. ROE FOR BOTH 2012 AND 2011 WAS 11%.

THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. NET REVENUE WAS FLAT COMPARED WITH 2011 AS LOWER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE AND LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, HIGHER OTHER INCOME, AND HIGHER SECURITIES GAINS. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR 2012 INCLUDED LOSSES FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

THE DECLINE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED A LOWER CONSUMER PROVISION AS NET CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS REDUCED BY $5.5 BILLION IN 2012. THE DECLINE IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE REFLECTED IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND REDUCED ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIOS. THE WHOLESALE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT REMAINED FAVORABLE THROUGHOUT 2012. FIRMWIDE, NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $9.1 BILLION FOR THE YEAR, DOWN $3.2 BILLION, OR 26%, FROM 2011, AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS AT YEAR-END WERE $11.7 BILLION, UP $419 MILLION, OR 4%. THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF REGULATORY GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTED DURING 2012, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FIRM REPORTING AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF NONPERFORMING LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 (SEE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD ON PAGES

140–148

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION). BEFORE THE

66

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

IMPACT OF THESE REPORTING CHANGES, NONPERFORMING ASSETS WOULD HAVE BEEN $8.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE TOTAL FIRMWIDE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $22.6 BILLION, RESULTING IN A LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO OF 2.43% OF TOTAL LOANS, EXCLUDING THE PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM’S 2012 RESULTS REFLECTED STRONG UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE ACROSS VIRTUALLY ALL ITS BUSINESSES, WITH STRONG LENDING AND DEPOSIT GROWTH. CONSUMER & BUSINESS BANKING WITHIN CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING ADDED 106 BRANCHES AND INCREASED DEPOSITS BY 11% IN 2012. BUSINESS BANKING LOANS INCREASED TO A RECORD $18.9 BILLION, UP 7% COMPARED WITH 2011. MORTGAGE BANKING REPORTED STRONG PRODUCTION REVENUE DRIVEN BY STRONG ORIGINATIONS GROWTH. IN CARD, MERCHANT SERVICES & AUTO, CREDIT CARD SALES VOLUME (EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL CARD) WAS UP 11% FOR THE YEAR. THE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK MAINTAINED ITS #1 RANKING IN GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND REPORTED RECORD ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY OF $18.8 TRILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. COMMERCIAL BANKING REPORTED RECORD NET REVENUE OF $6.8 BILLION AND RECORD NET INCOME OF $2.6 BILLION IN 2012. COMMERCIAL BANKING LOANS INCREASED TO A RECORD $128.2 BILLION, A 14% INCREASE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. ASSET MANAGEMENT REPORTED RECORD REVENUE IN 2012 AND ACHIEVED ITS FIFTEENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE NET LONG-TERM CLIENT FLOWS INTO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. ASSET MANAGEMENT ALSO INCREASED LOAN BALANCES TO A RECORD $80.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENDED THE YEAR WITH A BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON RATIO OF 11.0%, COMPARED WITH 10.1% AT YEAR-END 2011. THE FIRM ESTIMATED THAT ITS BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 8.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF FINAL BASEL 2.5 RULES AND THE PROPOSALS SET FORTH IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING (“NPR”). TOTAL DEPOSITS INCREASED TO $1.2 TRILLION, UP 6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WAS $204.1 BILLION. (THE BASEL I AND III TIER 1 COMMON RATIOS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH THE FIRM USES ALONG WITH THE OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES, TO ASSESS AND MONITOR ITS CAPITAL POSITION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL RATIOS, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

117–120

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.)

DURING 2012, THE FIRM WORKED TO HELP ITS CUSTOMERS, CORPORATE CLIENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS. THE FIRM PROVIDED CREDIT AND RAISED CAPITAL OF MORE THAN $1.8 TRILLION FOR ITS CLIENTS DURING 2012; THIS INCLUDED $20 BILLION LENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND $85 BILLION FOR NEARLY 1,500 NON-PROFIT AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, INCLUDING STATES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES. THE FIRM ALSO ORIGINATED MORE THAN 920,000 MORTGAGES, AND PROVIDED CREDIT CARDS TO APPROXIMATELY 6.7 MILLION PEOPLE. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2009, THE FIRM HAS OFFERED NEARLY 1.4 MILLION MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS AND OF THESE APPROXIMATELY 610,000 HAVE ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATIONS.

IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE DAMAGE AND DISRUPTION AT MANY OF ITS BRANCHES AND FACILITIES CAUSED BY SUPERSTORM SANDY AT

THE END OF OCTOBER 2012, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ASSIST CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND BORROWERS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. THE FIRM CONTINUED TO DISPENSE CASH THROUGH ATMS, LOAN MONEY, PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CUSTOMERS, AND SETTLE TRADES, AND IT WAIVED A NUMBER OF CHECKING ACCOUNT AND LOAN FEES, INCLUDING LATE PAYMENT FEES, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING

NET INCOME INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER NET REVENUE AND LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. NET REVENUE INCREASED, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NONINTEREST REVENUE. NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEPOSIT MARGINS AND LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO NET PORTFOLIO RUNOFF, LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED, DRIVEN BY HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBIT CARD REVENUE, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DURBIN AMENDMENT. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2012 WAS $3.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH $7.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $5.5 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE MORTGAGE LOAN AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $4.2 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCTION EXPENSE REFLECTING HIGHER VOLUMES, INVESTMENTS IN SALES FORCE AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE IN CARD. RETURN ON EQUITY FOR THE YEAR WAS 25% ON $43.0 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK

NET INCOME INCREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET REVENUE, LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND A LARGER BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. NET REVENUE FOR 2012 INCLUDED A $930 MILLION LOSS FROM DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS. THE PRIOR YEAR NET REVENUE INCLUDED A $1.4 BILLION GAIN FROM DVA. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A LARGER BENEFIT IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTED RECOVERIES AND A NET REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BOTH RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS, CURRENT CREDIT TRENDS AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE. RETURN ON EQUITY FOR THE YEAR WAS 18%, OR 19% EXCLUDING DVA (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE), ON $47.5 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

REPORTED RECORD NET INCOME FOR 2012, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE. NET REVENUE WAS A RECORD, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME AND HIGHER NONINTEREST REVENUE. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN LOAN AND LIABILITY BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPREAD COMPRESSION ON LOAN AND LIABILITY PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

67

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, LARGELY DRIVEN BY INCREASED INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE. RETURN ON EQUITY FOR THE YEAR WAS 28% ON $9.5 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NET INCOME INCREASED IN 2012, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET REVENUE. NET REVENUE INCREASED, DRIVEN BY NET INFLOWS TO PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME RESULTING FROM HIGHER LOAN AND DEPOSIT BALANCES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. RETURN ON EQUITY FOR THE YEAR WAS 24% ON $7.0 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY

REPORTED A NET LOSS IN 2012, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY LOSSES IN TREASURY AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE (“CIO”). TREASURY AND CIO NET REVENUE INCLUDED $5.8 BILLION OF PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS LOSSES FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN CIO DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 AND $449 MILLION OF LOSSES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012 ON THE RETAINED INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, CIO EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT THE INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT WERE RETAINED FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINDER OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO CIB ON JULY 2, 2012. TREASURY AND CIO NET REVENUE ALSO INCLUDED SECURITIES GAINS OF $2.0 BILLION FOR THE YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR NET REVENUE ALSO INCLUDED $888 MILLION OF EXTINGUISHMENT GAINS RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS NEGATIVE IN 2012, AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER PORTFOLIO YIELDS AND HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES ACROSS THE FIRM.

OTHER CORPORATE REPORTED A NET LOSS IN 2012. NONINTEREST REVENUE INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT AND A $665 MILLION GAIN FOR THE RECOVERY ON A BEAR STEARNS-RELATED SUBORDINATED LOAN. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDED AN EXPENSE OF $3.7 BILLION FOR ADDITIONAL LITIGATION RESERVES, PREDOMINANTLY FOR MORTGAGE-RELATED MATTERS. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED EXPENSE OF $3.2 BILLION FOR ADDITIONAL LITIGATION RESERVES.

NOTE: THE FIRM USES A SINGLE U.S.-BASED, BLENDED MARGINAL TAX RATE OF 38% (“THE MARGINAL RATE”) TO REPORT THE ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX EFFECTS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT ITEM AFFECTING NET INCOME. THIS RATE REPRESENTS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE MARGINAL TAX RATE FOR THE U.S. CONSOLIDATED TAX GROUP. THE FIRM USES THIS SINGLE MARGINAL RATE TO REFLECT THE TAX EFFECTS OF ALL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS BECAUSE (A) IT SIMPLIFIES THE PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS; (B) IT HAS PROVED TO BE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MARGINAL TAX EFFECTS; AND (C) OFTEN THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AT THE TIME A SIGNIFICANT ITEM IS DISCLOSED REGARDING ITS ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME.

2013 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE THE FIRM’S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SEE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ON PAGE

185

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT AND THE RISK FACTORS SECTION ON PAGES

8–21

OF THE 2012 FORM 10-K.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR 2013 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL AND U.S. ECONOMIES, FINANCIAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. EACH OF THESE LINKED FACTORS WILL AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND ITS LINES OF BUSINESS.

IN THE CONSUMER & BUSINESS BANKING BUSINESS WITHIN CCB, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT, GIVEN THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED DEPOSIT SPREAD COMPRESSION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ANNUAL NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION IN 2013. THIS DECLINE MAY BE OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF DEPOSIT BALANCE GROWTH, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT EXTENT OF ANY SUCH DEPOSIT GROWTH CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

IN THE MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESS WITHIN CCB, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ELEVATED DEFAULT- AND FORECLOSURE-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE SERVICING PROCESSES, PARTICULARLY ITS LOAN MODIFICATION AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE HIGH PRODUCTION MARGINS EXPERIENCED IN RECENT QUARTERS LIKELY PEAKED IN 2012 AND WILL DECLINE OVER TIME. MANAGEMENT ALSO EXPECTS THERE WILL BE CONTINUED ELEVATED LEVELS OF REPURCHASES OF MORTGAGES PREVIOUSLY SOLD, PREDOMINANTLY TO U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES (“GSES”). HOWEVER, BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS AND ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE EXISTING MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER SUCH LOSSES.

FOR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS WITHIN MORTGAGE BANKING, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT TOTAL QUARTERLY NET CHARGE-OFFS MAY BE APPROXIMATELY $550 MILLION, SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THE POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO CONTINUE OR ACCELERATE AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY DECLINES, THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY BE REDUCED OVER TIME. GIVEN MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT ESTIMATE OF PORTFOLIO RUNOFF LEVELS, THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 10% TO 15% IN 2013 FROM YEAR-END 2012 LEVELS. THE RUN-OFF IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO CAN BE EXPECTED TO REDUCE ANNUAL NET INTEREST INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN 2013. OVER TIME, THE REDUCTION IN NET INTEREST INCOME SHOULD BE OFFSET BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT COSTS

AND LOWER EXPENSES.

IN CARD SERVICES WITHIN CCB, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT, IF CURRENT POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS CONTINUE, THE CARD- RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COULD BE REDUCED BY UP TO $1 BILLION OVER THE COURSE OF 2013.

THE CURRENTLY A

NTICIPATED RESULTS FOR CCB DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. HOUSING PRICES OR THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, DO NOT CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PORTFOLIOS IN THESE BUSINESSES.

IN PRIVATE EQUITY, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, EARNINGS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND

68

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

INFLUENCED BY CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY, MARKET LEVELS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BROADER ECONOMY AND INVESTMENT-SPECIFIC ISSUES.

FOR TREASURY AND CIO, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS A QUARTERLY NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION WITH THAT AMOUNT LIKELY TO VARY DRIVEN BY THE IMPLIED YIELD CURVE AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS RELATED TO THE POSITIONING OF THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.

FOR OTHER CORPORATE, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS QUARTERLY NET INCOME, EXCLUDING MATERIAL LITIGATION EXPENSE AND SIGNIFICANT ITEMS, IF ANY, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION, BUT THIS AMOUNT IS ALSO LIKELY TO VARY EACH QUARTER.

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE FIRM'S NET INTEREST INCOME TO BE GENERALLY FLAT DURING 2013, AS MODEST PRESSURE ON THE NET YIELD ON INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY OFFSET BY ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON EXPENSE DISCIPLINE AND IS TARGETING EXPENSE FOR 2013 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION LOWER THAN IN 2012 (NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT, FOR SUCH PURPOSES, ANY EXPENSES IN EACH YEAR RELATED TO CORPORATE LITIGATION AND FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS).

CIO SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO

ON AUGUST 9, 2012, THE FIRM RESTATED ITS PREVIOUSLY-FILED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2012. THE RESTATEMENT RELATED TO VALUATIONS OF CERTAIN POSITIONS IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO OF THE FIRM’S CIO. THE RESTATEMENT HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE FIRM’S REPORTED NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012, BY $459 MILLION. THE RESTATEMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON ANY OF THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, AND DECEMBER 31, 2011, OR FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESTATEMENT AND THE RELATED VALUATION MATTER, SEE THE FIRM’S FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, FILED ON AUGUST 9, 2012.

MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINED THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTED IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT MARCH 31, 2012. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO REMEDIATE THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS, INCLUDING ENHANCING MANAGEMENT SUPERVISION OF VALUATION MATTERS. THESE REMEDIAL STEPS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BY JUNE 30, 2012; HOWEVER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS DESIGNATION COULD NOT BE CLOSED UNTIL THE REMEDIAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATIONAL FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND SUCCESSFULLY TESTED. THE TESTING WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012 AND THE CONTROL DEFICIENCY WAS CLOSED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2012. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE REMEDIAL CHANGES IN, AND RELATED TESTING OF, THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, SEE PART I, ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES IN THE FIRM’S FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, FILED ON NOVEMBER 8, 2012.

ON JULY 2, 2012, THE MAJORITY OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE CIO TO THE FIRM’S CIB, WHICH HAS THE EXPERTISE, TRADING PLATFORMS AND MARKET FRANCHISE TO MANAGE THESE POSITIONS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE. AN AGGREGATE POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $12 BILLION NOTIONAL WAS RETAINED IN CIO. BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012, CIO EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT THE INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT HAD BEEN RETAINED BY IT FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER. CIO INCURRED LOSSES OF $5.8 BILLION FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, AND LOSSES OF $449 MILLION FROM THE RETAINED INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN THE PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE LINE ITEM OF THE INCOME STATEMENT. CIB CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE AND REDUCE THE RISKS IN THE REMAINING SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO THAT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO IT ON JULY 2, 2012. THIS PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCED MODEST LOSSES IN EACH OF THE TWO QUARTERS OF 2012 FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER; THESE LOSSES WERE INCLUDED IN FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE FOR CIB (AND ALSO RECORDED IN THE PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE).

ON JANUARY 16, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE AND THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE “BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE”) HAD EACH CONCLUDED THEIR REVIEWS RELATING TO THE 2012 LOSSES BY THE CIO AND HAD RELEASED THEIR RESPECTIVE REPORTS. THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE’S REPORT SETS FORTH RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO THE BOARD’S OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FULL BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND HAVE BEEN, OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING, IMPLEMENTED.

THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REPORT, IN ADDITION TO SUMMARIZING THE KEY EVENTS AND SETTING FORTH ITS OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE LOSSES INCURRED IN CIO’S SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, DESCRIBES THE BROAD RANGE OF REMEDIAL MEASURES TAKEN BY THE FIRM TO RESPOND TO THE LESSONS IT HAS LEARNED FROM THE CIO EVENTS, INCLUDING.

•

REVAMPING THE GOVERNANCE, MANDATE AND REPORTING AND CONTROL PROCESSES OF CIO;

•

IMPLEMENTING NUMEROUS RISK MANAGEMENT CHANGES, INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN MODEL GOVERNANCE AND MARKET RISK; AND

•

EFFECTING A SERIES OF CHANGES TO THE RISK FUNCTION’S GOVERNANCE, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND INTERACTION WITH THE BOARD.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FORMED THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE IN MAY 2012 TO OVERSEE THE SCOPE AND WORK OF THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REVIEW, ASSESS THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES RELATED TO THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REVIEW, AND TO REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON THE REVIEW COMMITTEE’S FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IN PERFORMING THESE TASKS, THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ITS OWN COUNSEL AND EXPERT ADVISOR, CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW, INCLUDING ANALYZING THE VOLUMINOUS DOCUMENTARY RECORD AND CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS OF BOARD MEMBERS AND

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NUMEROUS CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE FIRM. BASED ON ITS REVIEW, THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REPORT. THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE REPORT AND THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT SET OUT FACTS THAT IN THEIR VIEW WERE THE MOST RELEVANT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE PURPOSES. OTHERS (INCLUDING REGULATORS CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS) MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE FACTS, OR MAY FOCUS ON OTHER FACTS, AND MAY ALSO DRAW DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE FACTS AND ISSUES.

THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT RECOMMENDS A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS TO THE BOARD’S OWN PRACTICES TO STRENGTHEN ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE NOTED THAT SOME OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ALREADY BEING FOLLOWED BY THE BOARD OR THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OR HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PUT INTO EFFECT.

THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE’S RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE.

•

BETTER FOCUSED AND CLEARER REPORTING OF PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE KEY RISKS FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, IDENTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT FUTURE CHANGES TO THE BUSINESS AND ITS RISK PROFILE, AND ADEQUACY OF STAFFING, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER RESOURCES;

•

CLARIFYING TO MANAGEMENT THE BOARD’S EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE CAPABILITIES, STATURE, AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL;

•

MORE SYSTEMATIC REPORTING TO THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE ON SIGNIFICANT MODEL RISK, MODEL APPROVAL AND MODEL GOVERNANCE, ON SETTING OF SIGNIFICANT RISK LIMITS AND RESPONSES TO SIGNIFICANT LIMIT EXCESSIONS, AND WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORY MATTERS REQUIRING ATTENTION;

•

FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE’S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AND MORE COORDINATION OF MATTERS PRESENTED TO THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE;

•

CONCURRENCE BY THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE HIRING OR FIRING OF THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND THAT IT BE CONSULTED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTING OF SUCH CHIEF RISK OFFICER’S COMPENSATION; AND

•

STAFF WITH APPROPRIATE RISK EXPERTISE BE ADDED TO THE FIRM’S INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION AND THAT INTERNAL AUDIT MORE SYSTEMATICALLY INCLUDE THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IN ITS AUDITS.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO OVERSEE THE FIRM’S REMEDIATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

ALSO, ON JANUARY 14, 2013, THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH, RESPECTIVELY, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“THE OCC”) THAT RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT, MODEL GOVERNANCE AND OTHER CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CIO AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AT THE FIRM. MANY OF THE ACTIONS REQUIRED BY THE CONSENT ORDERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE AND THE BOARD REVIEW COMMITTEE AND, AS SUCH, A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE BEEN, OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING, IMPLEMENTED. THE

FIRM IS COMMITTED TO THE FULL REMEDIATION OF ALL ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE CONSENT ORDERS.

THE CIO SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO LOSSES HAVE RESULTED IN LITIGATION AGAINST THE FIRM, AS WELL AS HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN ADDITION TO THE CONSENT ORDERS NOTED ABOVE. SUCH REGULATORY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS OR LOSSES, HARM THE FIRM’S REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO THE CIO MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES

316–325

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”), U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE INSTRUCTED TO CONDUCT APPROXIMATELY 285 RULEMAKINGS AND 130 STUDIES AND REPORTS. THESE AGENCIES INCLUDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (THE “OCC”), THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE “FDIC”), THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE “SEC”) AND THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION (THE “CFPB”). THE FIRM CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY IN ASSESSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE REGULATORY CHANGES IT IS FACING, AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENTING ALL THE NEW REGULATIONS WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, BEST MEETING THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF ITS CLIENTS.

DURING 2012, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS “RESOLUTION PLAN” IN THE EVENT OF A MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE, REGISTERED SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE CFTC AS SWAP DEALERS, AND CONTINUED ITS PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO NEW REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS DERIVATIVES, TRADING AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS BUSINESSES. THE FIRM ALSO FACES REGULATORY INITIATIVES RELATING TO ITS STRUCTURE, INCLUDING PUSH-OUT OF CERTAIN DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS UNDER SECTION 716 OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, A PROPOSED REQUIREMENT FROM THE U.K. FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (THE “FSA”) REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EITHER OBTAIN EQUAL TREATMENT FOR THE U.K. DEPOSITORS OF ITS U.S. BANK WHO MAKES DEPOSITS IN THE U.K., OR “SUBSIDIARIZE” IN THE U.K., AND VARIOUS OTHER PROPOSED U.K. AND EU INITIATIVES THAT COULD AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY EFFICIENTLY AMONG ITS GLOBAL OPERATIONS. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO COMPLY WITH THE HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW BASEL ACCORDS (BOTH THE “BASEL 2.5” REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013 AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF “BASEL III”). THE FIRM IS ALSO PREPARING TO COMPLY WITH BASEL III’S NEW LIQUIDITY MEASURES -- THE “LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO” (“LCR”) AND THE “NET STABLE

70

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

FUNDING RATIO” (“NSFR”) - WHICH REQUIRE THE FIRM TO HOLD SPECIFIED TYPES OF “HIGH QUALITY” LIQUID ASSETS TO MEET ASSUMED LEVELS OF CASH OUTFLOWS FOLLOWING A STRESS EVENT. MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT OBJECTIVE IS FOR THE FIRM TO REACH, BY THE END OF 2013, AN ESTIMATED BASEL III TIER I COMMON RATIO OF 9.5% (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE BASEL 2.5 RULES AND THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE OTHER APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S ADVANCED NPR ISSUED IN JUNE 2012). THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY TARGETING REACHING A 100% LCR, BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, BY THE END OF 2013.

FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM IS EXPERIENCING HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY BY ITS REGULATORS OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH NEW AND EXISTING REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE ISSUED UNDER THE BANK SECRECY ACT, THE UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES LAWS, THE REAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES ACT (“RESPA”), THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT, LAWS GOVERNING THE FIRM’S CONSUMER COLLECTIONS PRACTICES AND THE LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF FOREIGN CONTROL, AMONG OTHERS. THE FIRM IS ALSO UNDER SCRUTINY BY ITS SUPERVISORS WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONTROLS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES, SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO MODEL DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW, GOVERNANCE AND APPROVALS. ON JANUARY 14, 2013, THE FIRM AND THREE OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OCC RELATING PRINCIPALLY TO THE FIRM’S AND SUCH BANKS’ BSA/AML POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALSO ON JANUARY 14, 2013, THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS ARISING OUT OF THEIR REVIEWS OF THE FIRM’S CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE. THESE LATTER CONSENT ORDERS RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT, MODEL GOVERNANCE AND OTHER CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CIO AND CERTAIN OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AT THE FIRM. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT ITS BANKING SUPERVISORS WILL IN THE FUTURE CONTINUE TO TAKE MORE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM RATHER THAN ISSUING INFORMAL SUPERVISORY ACTIONS OR CRITICISMS.

WHILE THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGES IN LAW AND THE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OF ITS REGULATORS IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS, THE FIRM CANNOT, GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY DEVELOPMENTS, QUANTIFY THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF ALL THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ON PAGES

1–8

AND RISK FACTORS ON PAGES

8–21.

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2013 COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”) PROCESS. THE FIRM’S PLAN RELATES TO THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2013 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 (THAT IS, THE 2013 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN RELATES TO DIVIDENDS TO BE DECLARED COMMENCING IN JUNE 2013 AND PAYABLE IN JULY 2013, AND TO COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASES AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIONS COMMENCING APRIL 1, 2013). THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FINAL RESPONSE TO ITS PLAN NO LATER THAN MARCH 14, 2013. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRM’S 2012 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL DECLARE THE REGULAR QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER SHARE FOR THE 2013 FIRST QUARTER AT ITS BOARD MEETING TO BE

HELD ON MARCH 19, 2013. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO A NON-OBJECTION RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2012 WITH RESPECT TO THE 2012 CAPITAL PLAN IT RESUBMITTED IN AUGUST 2012, THE FIRM IS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF COMMON EQUITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TIMING AND EXACT AMOUNT OF ANY COMMON EQUITY TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION; ORGANIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

116–122.

BUSINESS EVENTS

SUPERSTORM SANDY

ON OCTOBER 29, 2012, THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST REGIONS OF THE U.S. WERE AFFECTED BY SUPERSTORM SANDY, WHICH CAUSED MAJOR FLOODING AND WIND DAMAGE AND RESULTED IN MAJOR DISRUPTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO HOMES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE AFFECTED REGIONS. DESPITE THE DAMAGE AND DISRUPTION TO MANY OF ITS BRANCHES AND FACILITIES, THE FIRM HAS BEEN ASSISTING ITS CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND BORROWERS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. THE FIRM HAS CONTINUED TO DISPENSE CASH VIA ATMS AND BRANCHES, LOAN MONEY, PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CUSTOMERS, AND SETTLE TRADES, AND IT WAIVED A NUMBER OF CHECKING ACCOUNT AND LOAN FEES, INCLUDING LATE PAYMENT FEES. SUPERSTORM SANDY DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FIRM AND THE FIRM DOES NOT ANTICIPATE TOTAL LOSSES DUE TO THE STORM WILL BE MATERIAL.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM PROVIDING FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW PROGRAMS (THE “INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW”). UNDER THIS SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM WILL MAKE A CASH PAYMENT OF

$753 MILLION

INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND FOR DISTRIBUTION TO QUALIFIED BORROWERS. THE FIRM HAS ALSO COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL

$1.2 BILLION

TO FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS, WHICH WILL BE FULFILLED THROUGH CREDITS GIVEN TO THE FIRM FOR MODIFICATIONS, SHORT SALES AND OTHER SPECIFIED TYPES OF BORROWER RELIEF. FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS THAT EARN CREDIT UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT ARE IN ADDITION TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM TO EARN CREDIT UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE FIRM WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS REQUIRED UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED A PRETAX CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY

$700 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 RELATED TO THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2012 WAS

$97.0 BILLION

, DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2011. RESULTS FOR 2012 WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FROM LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO, AND LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME. THESE ITEMS WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME IN CCB AND HIGHER OTHER INCOME IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 2011, REFLECTING LOWER ADVISORY FEES ON LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SLIGHTLY LOWER EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES ON INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES THAT WERE FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE DECLINES WERE PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY RECORD DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATES.

AND NOTE 7 ON PAGES

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2011, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO $5.8 BILLION OF LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, AND $449 MILLION OF LOSSES INCURRED BY CIO FROM THE RETAINED INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE POSITIONS FOR THE

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTION REVENUE ALSO INCLUDED A

$930 MILLION

LOSS IN 2012, COMPARED WITH A

$1.4 BILLION

GAIN IN 2011, FROM DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES, RESULTING FROM THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKET-MAKING REVENUE IN CIB, DRIVEN BY STRONG CLIENT REVENUE AND HIGHER REVENUE IN RATES-RELATED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS A

$665 MILLION

GAIN RECOGNIZED IN OTHER CORPORATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOVERY ON A BEAR STEARNS-RELATED SUBORDINATED LOAN. PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS DECREASED IN 2012, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER UNREALIZED AND REALIZED GAINS ON PRIVATE INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER UNREALIZED GAINS ON PUBLIC SECURITIES.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE DECREASED FROM 2011. THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS IN CIB. THIS DECREASE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM DRIVEN BY NET CLIENT INFLOWS, THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS, AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE FEES; AND HIGHER INVESTMENT SERVICE FEES IN CCB, AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN BRANCH SALES OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011. THE INCREASE RESULTED FROM HIGHER PRODUCTION REVENUE, REFLECTING WIDER MARGINS DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS; AND HIGHER VOLUMES DUE TO HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES AND THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAMS (“HARP”). THE INCREASE ALSO RESULTED FROM A FAVORABLE SWING IN RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS RELATED

72

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

TO MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”), WHICH WAS A GAIN OF

$619 MILLION

IN 2012, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF

CARD INCOME DECREASED DURING 2012, DRIVEN BY LOWER DEBIT CARD REVENUE, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DURBIN AMENDMENT; AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS. THE DECREASE IN CREDIT CARD INCOME WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD SALES VOLUME, AND HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE THE CCB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

80–91

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, LARGELY DUE TO A

$1.1 BILLION

BENEFIT FROM THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT, AND

$888 MILLION

OF EXTINGUISHMENT GAINS IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY RELATED TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES (“TRUPS”). THE EXTINGUISHMENT GAINS WERE RELATED TO ADJUSTMENTS APPLIED TO THE COST BASIS OF THE TRUPS DURING THE PERIOD THEY WERE IN A QUALIFIED HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIP. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR-YEAR GAIN ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTMENT IN AM.

NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER AVERAGE TRADING ASSET BALANCES, THE RUNOFF OF HIGHER-YIELDING LOANS, FASTER PREPAYMENT OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, LIMITED REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE FIRM’S INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPOSIT AND OTHER BORROWING COSTS. THE FIRM’S AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE

$1.8 TRILLION

FOR 2012, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (“FTE”) BASIS, WAS

2.48%

, A DECREASE OF

26

BASIS POINTS FROM 2011.

2011 COMPARED WITH 2010

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2011 WAS

$97.2 BILLION

, A DECREASE OF

$5.5 BILLION

, OR

5%

, FROM 2010. RESULTS FOR 2011 WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME IN SEVERAL BUSINESSES, LOWER SECURITIES GAINS IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, LOWER MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME IN CCB, AND LOWER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES, LARGELY IN AM.

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES DECREASED FROM 2010, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO DECLINES IN EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES. THE IMPACT FROM LOWER INDUSTRY-WIDE VOLUMES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2011 MORE THAN OFFSET THE FIRM’S RECORD LEVEL OF DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR. ADVISORY FEES INCREASED FOR THE YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED M&A VOLUMES RELATIVE TO THE 2010 LEVEL.

PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE DECREASED COMPARED WITH 2010. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER TRADING REVENUE AND LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS. TRADING REVENUE INCLUDED A

$1.4 BILLION

GAIN FROM DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES, RESULTING FROM THE WIDENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS; THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

$769 MILLION

LOSS, NET OF HEDGES, FROM CVA ON DERIVATIVE ASSETS IN CIB’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO, DUE TO THE WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATED TO THE FIRM’S COUNTERPARTIES. THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED A

$509 MILLION

GAIN FROM DVA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

$403 MILLION

LOSS, NET OF HEDGES, FROM CVA. EXCLUDING DVA AND CVA, LOWER TRADING REVENUE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS ON CORPORATE AND CIB DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. LOWER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO NET WRITE-DOWNS ON PRIVATELY-HELD INVESTMENTS AND THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR GAINS FROM SALES IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES INCREASED MODESTLY IN 2011 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHECKING ACCOUNT PRODUCT OFFERING BY CCB IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, AND THE SUBSEQUENT CONVERSION OF CERTAIN EXISTING ACCOUNTS INTO THE NEW PRODUCT. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET PARTLY BY THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY AND POLICY CHANGES AFFECTING NONSUFFICIENT FUND/OVERDRAFT FEES IN CCB.

ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE INCREASED FROM 2010, REFLECTING HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT FEES IN AM AND CCB, DRIVEN BY NET INFLOWS TO PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MARKET LEVELS; AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATION FEES IN CIB, REFLECTING NET INFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY.

SECURITIES GAINS DECREASED, COMPARED WITH THE 2010 LEVEL, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPOSITIONING OF THE AFS PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND TO REBALANCING EXPOSURES.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME DECREASED IN 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010, REFLECTING A MSR RISK MANAGEMENT LOSS OF

$1.6 BILLION

FOR 2011, COMPARED WITH INCOME OF

$1.1 BILLION

FOR 2010, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER REPURCHASE LOSSES IN 2011. THE

$1.6 BILLION

LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY A

111–115

AND NOTE 29 ON PAGES

308–315

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CARD INCOME INCREASED DURING 2011, LARGELY REFLECTING HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME ON CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, AS WELL AS LOWER PARTNER REVENUE-SHARING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO SALE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE FROM FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE DURBIN AMENDMENT.

OTHER INCOME INCREASED IN 2011, DRIVEN BY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ON CERTAIN ASSETS AND INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS IN CIB, AND HIGHER AUTO OPERATING LEASE INCOME IN CCB, RESULTING FROM GROWTH IN LEASE VOLUME.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS A GAIN ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTMENT IN AM.

NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED IN 2011 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES AND YIELDS IN CCB, REFLECTING THE EXPECTED RUNOFF OF CREDIT CARD BALANCES AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS; LOWER FEES ON CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSIT BALANCES AND RELATED YIELDS; AND LOWER YIELDS ON SECURITIES, REFLECTING PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING IN ANTICIPATION OF AN INCREASING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE DECREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CREDIT CARD CHARGE-OFFS, AND HIGHER TRADING ASSET BALANCES. THE FIRM’S AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WERE

$1.8 TRILLION

FOR THE 2011 FULL YEAR, AND THE NET YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS, ON A FTE BASIS, WAS

2.74%

, A DECREASE OF

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED BY

$4.2 BILLION

FROM 2011. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER PROVISION FOR CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD LOANS, WHICH REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE NON-PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO AS DELINQUENCY TRENDS IMPROVED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHARGE-OFFS OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS. A HIGHER LEVEL OF RECOVERIES AND LOWER CHARGE-OFFS IN THE WHOLESALE PROVISION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, LARGELY DUE TO A SMALLER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2012 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

$770 MILLION

, REFLECTING ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PCI LOANS PORTFOLIO. THE CREDIT CARD PROVISION WAS DOWN, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY IMPROVED

DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND NET CREDIT LOSSES. THE BENEFIT FROM THE WHOLESALE PROVISION WAS LOWER IN 2011 THAN IN 2010, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOAN GROWTH AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY.

, UP BY

, FROM 2011. COMPENSATION EXPENSE DROVE THE INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE SALES FORCE IN CCB AND BANKERS IN THE OTHER BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN CIB.

NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR 2012 INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING BRANCH BUILDS IN CCB; HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME IN CIB AND CCB; HIGHER REGULATORY DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS; EXPENSES RELATED TO EXITING A NON-CORE PRODUCT AND WRITING-OFF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN CCB; AND HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LITIGATION EXPENSE IN AM AND CCB (INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT) AND LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE IN CCB.

TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2011 WAS

$62.9 BILLION

, UP BY

$1.7 BILLION

, OR

3%

, FROM 2010. BOTH COMPENSATION AND NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN BRANCH AND MORTGAGE PRODUCTION SALES AND SUPPORT STAFF IN CCB AND INCREASED HEADCOUNT IN AM, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE ABSENCE OF THE 2010 U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX IN CIB.

THE INCREASE IN NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2011 WAS DUE TO ELEVATED FORECLOSURE- AND DEFAULT-RELATED COSTS IN CCB, INCLUDING

$1.7 BILLION

OF EXPENSE FOR FEES AND ASSESSMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER COSTS OF FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS, HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE IN CCB, HIGHER FDIC ASSESSMENTS ACROSS BUSINESSES, NON-CLIENT-RELATED LITIGATION EXPENSE IN AM, AND THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING NEW BRANCHES IN CCB. THESE WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER LITIGATION EXPENSE IN 2011 IN CORPORATE AND CIB. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE FDIC CHANGED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENT RATE FOR LARGE BANKS. THE NEW RULE CHANGED THE ASSESSMENT BASE FROM INSURED DEPOSITS TO AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS LESS AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY, AND CHANGED THE ASSESSMENT RATE CALCULATION.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S.(“U.S. GAAP”); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES

188–192

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS “REPORTED” BASIS, PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRM’S RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM’S PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES’ U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRM’S RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRM’S RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS ON A “MANAGED” BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE FIRM’S DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND INCLUDES CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRESENT TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FIRM (AND EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS) ON A FTE BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS PRESENTED IN

THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES. THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUE ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME AS REPORTED BY THE FIRM AS A WHOLE OR BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE BUSINESS-SEGMENT LEVEL, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THESE OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND, THEREFORE, FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS COMPETITORS. NON- GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY THE FIRM MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION FROM THE FIRM’S REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO MANAGED BASIS.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (“TCE”), ROTCE, TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE (“TBVS”), AND TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I AND III RULES ARE EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TCE REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (I.E., TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY LESS PREFERRED STOCK) LESS GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OTHER THAN MSRS), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ROTCE MEASURES THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TCE. TBVS REPRESENTS THE FIRM’S TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY DIVIDED BY PERIOD-END COMMON SHARES. TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I AND III RULES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT, ALONG WITH OTHER CAPITAL MEASURES, TO ASSESS AND MONITOR THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION. TCE, ROTCE, AND TBVS ARE MEANINGFUL TO THE FIRM, AS WELL AS ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, IN ASSESSING THE FIRM’S USE OF EQUITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I AND III, SEE REGULATORY CAPITAL ON PAGES

CORE NET INTEREST INCOME

IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING JPMORGAN CHASE’S NET INTEREST INCOME ON A MANAGED BASIS, MANAGEMENT ALSO REVIEWS CORE NET INTEREST INCOME TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS CORE LENDING, INVESTING (INCLUDING ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT) AND DEPOSIT-RAISING ACTIVITIES (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CIB’S MARKET-BASED ACTIVITIES). THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF CORE NET INTEREST INCOME, CORE AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, AND THE CORE NET INTEREST YIELD ON CORE AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, ON A MANAGED BASIS. EACH OF THESE AMOUNTS IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF CIB’S MARKET-BASED NET INTEREST INCOME AND THE RELATED ASSETS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE EXCLUSION OF CIB’S MARKET-BASED ACTIVITIES PROVIDES INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS A MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURE BY WHICH TO ANALYZE THE NON-MARKET-RELATED BUSINESS TRENDS OF THE FIRM AND PROVIDES A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON CORE LENDING, INVESTING AND DEPOSIT-RAISING ACTIVITIES.

$101.4 BILLION

IN 2012 TO

$1,343.1 BILLION

. THE DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME IN 2012 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE RUNOFF OF HIGHER-YIELDING LOANS, FASTER PREPAYMENT OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, LIMITED REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE FIRM’S INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPOSIT AND OTHER BORROWING COSTS. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, INCREASED LEVELS OF LOANS, AND AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT SECURITIES. THE CORE NET INTEREST YIELD DECREASED BY

32

BASIS POINTS TO

IN 2012, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RUNOFF OF HIGHER-YIELDING LOANS AS WELL AS LOWER CUSTOMER LOAN RATES, HIGHER FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, LIMITED REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY LOWER CUSTOMER DEPOSIT RATES.

IN 2011 TO

$1,241.7 BILLION

. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER LEVELS OF DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND SECURITIES BORROWED DUE TO WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CLIENT DEPOSIT GROWTH. THE CORE NET INTEREST YIELD DECREASED BY

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE OF BUSINESS BASIS. THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS – CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING, CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON A MANAGED BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF MANAGED BASIS, SEE EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ON PAGES

76–77

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BUSINESS SEGMENT CHANGES

COMMENCING WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE FIRM'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN REORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES & AUTO (“CARD”) BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE COMBINED TO FORM ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT CALLED CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (“CCB”), AND INVESTMENT BANK AND TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE COMBINED TO FORM ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT CALLED CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK (“CIB”). COMMERCIAL BANKING (“CB”) AND ASSET MANAGEMENT (“AM”) WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED CHANGES. A TECHNOLOGY FUNCTION SUPPORTING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING WAS TRANSFERRED FROM CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY TO THE CCB BUSINESS SEGMENT. THIS TRANSFER DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF EITHER THE CCB BUSINESS SEGMENT OR CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY.

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE BUSINESS REORGANIZATION RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2010.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ALLOCATES INCOME AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS, METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRM’S CLIENTS, THE PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THE SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT THESE REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO THE TREASURY GROUP WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THAT SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, AND AS COMPARED WITH ITS STAND-ALONE PEERS. THIS PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE (“ALCO”). BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY BE PERMITTED TO RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT APPROVAL.

78

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPITAL THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS), ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS.

THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2012, THE FIRM REVISED THE CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO CERTAIN BUSINESSES, REFLECTING ADDITIONAL REFINEMENT OF EACH SEGMENT’S ESTIMATED BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND BALANCE SHEET TRENDS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL ALLOCATION, INCLUDING REFINEMENTS TO THE CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT – LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ON PAGE

121

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, OR ANOTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT, THE COSTS OF THOSE SERVICES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE EXPENSE IS GENERALLY ALLOCATED BASED ON ACTUAL COST AND UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. IN CONTRAST, CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, OR TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. RETAINED EXPENSE INCLUDES: PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT ALIGNED WITH A PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

THE CURRENT YEAR PROVISION ALSO INCLUDED A $230 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS A REDUCTION OF $1.0 BILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE RELATED TO THE NON-CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIO, AS ESTIMATED LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO HAVE DECLINED, PREDOMINANTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $770 MILLION REFLECTING ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PCI PORTFOLIO DUE TO HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED DEFAULT FREQUENCY RELATIVE TO MODELED LIFETIME LOSS ESTIMATES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A HIGHER IMPAIRMENT OF THE PCI PORTFOLIO AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.5 BILLION, OR 43%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY ELEVATED FORECLOSURE- AND DEFAULT-RELATED COSTS IN MORTGAGE SERVICING.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NET PRODUCTION REVENUE

INCLUDES NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON ORIGINATIONS AND SALES OF PRIME AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS, OTHER PRODUCTION-RELATED FEES AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF PREVIOUSLY-SOLD LOANS.

NET MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE

INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

(A) OPERATING REVENUE COMPRISES.

– GROSS INCOME EARNED FROM SERVICING THIRD-PARTY MORTGAGE LOANS INCLUDING STATED SERVICE FEES, EXCESS SERVICE FEES AND OTHER ANCILLARY FEES; AND

– MODELED MSR ASSET AMORTIZATION (OR TIME DECAY).

(B) RISK MANAGEMENT COMPRISES.

– CHANGES IN MSR ASSET FAIR VALUE DUE TO MARKET-BASED INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS UPDATES TO ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MSR VALUATION MODEL; AND

– CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE AND OTHER, WHICH REPRESENTS CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES TO THE MSR VALUATION MODEL.

MORTGAGE ORIGINATION CHANNELS COMPRISE THE FOLLOWING.

RETAIL

– BORROWERS WHO BUY OR REFINANCE A HOME THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH A MORTGAGE BANKER EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM USING A BRANCH OFFICE, THE INTERNET OR BY PHONE. BORROWERS ARE FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO A MORTGAGE BANKER BY A BANKER IN A CHASE BRANCH, REAL ESTATE BROKERS, HOME BUILDERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

WHOLESALE

– THIRD-PARTY MORTGAGE BROKERS REFER LOAN APPLICATION PACKAGES TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM THEN UNDERWRITES AND FUNDS THE LOAN. BROKERS ARE INDEPENDENT LOAN ORIGINATORS THAT SPECIALIZE IN COUNSELING APPLICANTS ON AVAILABLE HOME FINANCING OPTIONS, BUT DO NOT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR LOANS. CHASE MATERIALLY ELIMINATED BROKER-ORIGINATED LOANS IN 2008, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL NUMBER OF LOANS GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE UNDER ITS SECTION 502 GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM THAT SERVES LOW-AND-MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES IN SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES.

CORRESPONDENT

– BANKS, THRIFTS, OTHER MORTGAGE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SELL CLOSED LOANS TO THE FIRM.

CORRESPONDENT NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS (“CNTS”)

– MID-TO-LARGE-SIZED MORTGAGE LENDERS, BANKS AND BANK-OWNED MORTGAGE COMPANIES SELL SERVICING TO THE FIRM ON AN AS-ORIGINATED BASIS (EXCLUDING SALES OF BULK SERVICING TRANSACTIONS). THESE TRANSACTIONS SUPPLEMENT TRADITIONAL PRODUCTION CHANNELS AND PROVIDE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SERVICING PORTFOLIO IN PERIODS OF STABLE AND RISING INTEREST RATES.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

MORTGAGE PRODUCTION

PRETAX INCOME WAS $3.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2.6 BILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION-RELATED REVENUE, EXCLUDING REPURCHASE LOSSES, WAS

$6.6 BILLION

, AN INCREASE OF

$2.3 BILLION

, OR

55%

, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE RESULTS REFLECTED WIDER MARGINS, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS, AND HIGHER VOLUMES DUE TO HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES AND THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAMS (“HARP”). PRODUCTION EXPENSE, INCLUDING CREDIT COSTS, WAS

$2.7 BILLION

, AN INCREASE OF

$852 MILLION

, OR

45%

, REFLECTING HIGHER VOLUMES AND ADDITIONAL LITIGATION COSTS. REPURCHASE LOSSES WERE $272 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT-YEAR REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF $683 MILLION COMPARED WITH A BUILD OF $213 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED CURE RATES ON AGENCY REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND LOWER OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE DEMAND PIPELINE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY ON PAGES

111–115

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE SERVICING

REPORTED A PRETAX LOSS OF

$1.2 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH A PRETAX LOSS OF

$3.8 BILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION, WAS $3.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $337 MILLION, OR 13%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (“MSR”) ASSET AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF LOWER MSR ASSET VALUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOAN SERVICING REVENUE DUE TO THE DECLINE IN THE THIRD-PARTY LOANS SERVICED. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT INCOME WAS

$616 MILLION

, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF

$1.6 BILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIOR YEAR MSR RISK MANAGEMENT LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY REFINEMENTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL AND RELATED INPUTS. SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

291–295

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET AND RELATED HEDGES. SERVICING EXPENSE WAS

$4.7 BILLION

, DOWN

2%

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, BUT ELEVATED IN BOTH THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DEFAULT SERVICING COSTS.

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

PRETAX INCOME WAS $2.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A PRETAX LOSS OF $504 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY A BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT TRENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. NET REVENUE WAS $4.1 BILLION, DOWN $500 MILLION, OR 11%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO PORTFOLIO RUNOFF. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES REFLECTED A BENEFIT OF $509 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A PROVISION EXPENSE OF $3.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A $3.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO IMPROVED DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. CURRENT-YEAR NET CHARGE-OFFS TOTALED $3.3 BILLION, INCLUDING $744 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS, RELATED TO REGULATORY GUIDANCE, COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

138–149

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF AMOUNTS AND RATES. NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE $7.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.9 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY GUIDANCE, NONACCRUAL LOANS WOULD HAVE BEEN $4.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE REPORTING OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS AND PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AS NONACCRUAL, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

138–149

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $1.7 BILLION, UP $132 MILLION, OR 9%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SERVICING COSTS.

$216 MILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. PRODUCTION-RELATED REVENUE, EXCLUDING REPURCHASE LOSSES, WAS

$4.2 BILLION

, A DECREASE OF

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER VOLUMES AND NARROWER MARGINS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. PRODUCTION EXPENSE WAS

$1.9 BILLION

, AN INCREASE OF

$282 MILLION

, OR

17%

, REFLECTING A STRATEGIC SHIFT TO HIGHER-COST RETAIL ORIGINATIONS BOTH THROUGH THE BRANCH NETWORK AND DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER. REPURCHASE LOSSES WERE

$1.3 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH PRIOR-YEAR REPURCHASE LOSSES OF

$2.9 BILLION

, WHICH INCLUDED A

$1.6 BILLION

INCREASE IN THE REPURCHASE RESERVE.

MORTGAGE SERVICING

REPORTED A PRETAX LOSS OF

$3.8 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH PRETAX INCOME OF

$1.2 BILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. MORTGAGE SERVICING REVENUE, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION WAS

$2.6 BILLION

, OR FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. MSR RISK MANAGEMENT WAS A LOSS OF

$1.6 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH INCOME OF

$1.2 BILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY REFINEMENTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL AND RELATED INPUTS. SERVICING EXPENSE WAS

$4.8 BILLION

, AN INCREASE OF

$2.3 BILLION

, DRIVEN BY

$1.7 BILLION

RECORDED FOR FEES AND ASSESSMENTS, AND OTHER COSTS OF FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS, AS WELL AS HIGHER CORE AND DEFAULT SERVICING COSTS. SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

291–295

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET AND RELATED HEDGES.

REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS

REPORTED A PRETAX LOSS OF $504 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A PRETAX LOSS OF $4.3 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE. NET REVENUE WAS

$4.6 BILLION

, DOWN BY

$955 MILLION

, OR

17%

, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF LOWER LOAN BALANCES DUE TO PORTFOLIO RUNOFF AND NARROWER LOAN SPREADS. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$3.6 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$8.2 BILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN IMPROVEMENT IN CHARGE-OFF TRENDS AND A NET REDUCTION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES OF

$230 MILLION

. THE NET CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE REFLECTED A

$1.0 BILLION

REDUCTION RELATED TO THE NON-CREDIT-IMPAIRED PORTFOLIOS AS ESTIMATED LOSSES DECLINED, PREDOMINATELY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF

$770 MILLION

REFLECTING ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PCI PORTFOLIO DUE TO HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED DEFAULT FREQUENCY RELATIVE TO MODELED LIFETIME LOSS ESTIMATES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED A HIGHER IMPAIRMENT OF THE PCI PORTFOLIO AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS. SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

138–149

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF AMOUNTS AND RATES. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS

$1.5 BILLION

, DOWN BY

$106 MILLION

, OR

7%

, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN FORECLOSED ASSET EXPENSE DUE TO TEMPORARY DELAYS IN FORECLOSURE ACTIVITY.

PCI LOANS

INCLUDED WITHIN REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS ARE PCI LOANS THAT THE FIRM ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION. FOR PCI LOANS, THE EXCESS OF THE UNDISCOUNTED GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOANS (THE “ACCRETABLE YIELD”) IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE LOANS.

THE NET SPREAD BETWEEN THE PCI LOANS AND THE RELATED LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER TIME, EXCEPT FOR ANY BASIS RISK OR OTHER RESIDUAL INTEREST RATE RISK THAT REMAINS AND FOR CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE (E.G., FROM EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS AND FROM PREPAYMENTS). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF THE PCI LOAN PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO BE

8

YEARS. THE LOAN BALANCES ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE MORE RAPIDLY OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS AS THE MOST TROUBLED LOANS ARE LIQUIDATED, AND MORE SLOWLY THEREAFTER AS THE REMAINING TROUBLED BORROWERS HAVE LIMITED REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. SIMILARLY, DEFAULT AND SERVICING EXPENSE ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND DECLINE OVER TIME AS LIQUIDATIONS SLOW DOWN.

TO DATE THE IMPACT OF THE PCI LOANS ON REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS’ NET INCOME HAS BEEN NEGATIVE. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES RECOGNIZED SUBSEQUENT TO ITS ACQUISITION, AND THE HIGHER LEVEL OF DEFAULT AND SERVICING EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PORTFOLIO. OVER TIME, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THIS PORTFOLIO WILL CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO NET INCOME.

2012 COMPARED WITH 2011

CARD, MERCHANT SERVICES & AUTO

NET INCOME WAS $4.0 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $537 MILLION, OR 12%, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET REVENUE AND HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

NET REVENUE WAS $18.8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $371 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $13.7 BILLION, DOWN $580 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS AND LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $5.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $209 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, INCLUDING LOWER PARTNER REVENUE-SHARING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO SALE ON APRIL 1, 2011

,

AND HIGHER MERCHANT SERVICING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND A $1.6 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED A $3.9 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

1

WAS 3.94%, DOWN FROM 5.40% IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATE

1

WAS 2.10%, DOWN FROM 2.81% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 3.87% ABSENT A POLICY CHANGE ON RESTRUCTURED LOANS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS. THE AUTO NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 0.39%, UP FROM 0.32% IN THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDING $53 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO REGULATORY GUIDANCE. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGE-OFFS, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 0.28%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $171 MILLION, OR 2%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY EXPENSES RELATED TO A NON-CORE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING EXITED AND THE WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH A NON-STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING EXPENSE.

2011 COMPARED WITH 2010

CARD, MERCHANT SERVICES & AUTO

NET INCOME WAS $4.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.9 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE WAS $19.1 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $1.3 BILLION, OR 7%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $14.2 BILLION, DOWN BY $1.9 BILLION, OR 12%. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES, THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AND A DECREASED LEVEL OF FEES. THESE DECREASES WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE REVERSALS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CHARGE-OFFS. NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $4.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $614 MILLION, OR 14%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE TRANSFER OF THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS TO CARD FROM CIB IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, HIGHER NET INTERCHANGE INCOME, AND LOWER PARTNER REVENUE-SHARING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO SALE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE FROM FEE-BASED PRODUCTS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS, NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED 8%.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $3.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $8.6 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT-YEAR PROVISION REFLECTED LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN DELINQUENCY RATES, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION OF $3.9 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO LOWER ESTIMATED LOSSES. THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION INCLUDED A REDUCTION OF $6.2 BILLION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFF RATE

1

WAS 5.40%, DOWN FROM 9.72% IN THE PRIOR YEAR; AND THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATE

1

WAS 2.81%, DOWN FROM 4.07% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE AUTO NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 0.32%, DOWN FROM 0.63% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $8.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $867 MILLION, OR 12%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE AND THE INCLUSION OF THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS, NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 8%.

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT WAS ENACTED. THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. THE TOTAL ESTIMATED REDUCTION IN NET INCOME RESULTING FROM THE CARD ACT WAS APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION AND $300 MILLION IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

1

THE NET CHARGE-OFF AND 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY RATES PRESENTED FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, WHICH INCLUDE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. MANAGEMENT USES THIS AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE WAS A RECORD $4.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.8 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY CONTINUED DEPOSIT BALANCE GROWTH AND HIGHER AVERAGE TRADE LOANS OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. LENDING REVENUE WAS $1.3 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME ON INCREASED AVERAGE RETAINED LOANS AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FAIR VALUE LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK-RELATED HEDGES OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO.

MARKETS AND INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE WAS $23.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $23.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. COMBINED FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $19.8 BILLION, UP FROM $19.3 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR AS CLIENT REVENUE REMAINED STRONG ACROSS MOST PRODUCTS, WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTH IN RATES-RELATED PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. 2012 GENERALLY SAW CREDIT SPREAD TIGHTENING AND LOWER VOLATILITY IN BOTH THE CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, DURING WHICH MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE EUROZONE, CAUSED CREDIT SPREAD WIDENING AND GENERALLY MORE VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. SECURITIES SERVICES REVENUE WAS $4.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.9

BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES. ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY GREW TO A RECORD $18.8 TRILLION BY THE END OF 2012, DRIVEN BY BOTH MARKET APPRECIATION AS WELL AS NET INFLOWS. CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS & OTHER WAS A LOSS OF $841 MILLION, DRIVEN PREDOMINANTLY BY DVA, WHICH WAS A LOSS OF $930 MILLION DUE TO THE TIGHTENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $479 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $285 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS CREDIT TRENDS REMAINED STABLE. THE CURRENT-YEAR BENEFIT REFLECTED RECOVERIES AND A NET REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS, CURRENT CREDIT TRENDS AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES. NET RECOVERIES WERE $284 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $161 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE DOWN 49% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.9 BILLION, DOWN 1%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 18% ON $47.5 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

2011 COMPARED WITH 2010

NET INCOME WAS $8.0 BILLION, UP 4% COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER NET REVENUE COMPARED WITH 2010, AND LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE, LARGELY OFFSET BY A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. NET REVENUE INCLUDED A $1.4 BILLION GAIN FROM DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE WIDENING OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREADS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DVA, NET REVENUE WAS $32.5 BILLION AND NET INCOME WAS $7.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $33.0 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY.

NET REVENUE WAS $34.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $33.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. BANKING REVENUES WERE $10.8 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $10.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WERE $5.9 BILLION, DOWN 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR; THESE CONSISTED OF DEBT UNDERWRITING FEES OF $2.9 BILLION (DOWN 8%), ADVISORY FEES OF $1.8 BILLION (UP 22%) AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $1.2 BILLION (DOWN 26%). TREASURY SERVICES REVENUE WAS $3.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES AS WELL AS HIGHER TRADE LOAN VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TRANSFER OF THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS TO CARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. LENDING REVENUE WAS $1.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $811 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY LOWER FAIR VALUE LOSSES ON HEDGES OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO.

MARKETS AND INVESTOR SERVICES REVENUE WAS $23.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $22.8 BILLION THE YEAR PRIOR. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE WAS $14.8 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $14.7 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WITH CONTINUED SOLID CLIENT REVENUE. EQUITY MARKETS REVENUE WAS $4.5 BILLION COMPARED WITH $4.6 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR ON SLIGHTLY LOWER PERFORMANCE. SECURITIES SERVICES REVENUE WAS $3.9 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.7 BILLION THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY HIGHER

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

NET INTEREST INCOME DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT BALANCES AND NET INFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY. CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS & OTHER WAS A GAIN OF $109 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $221 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $285 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $1.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE BENEFIT IN 2011 REFLECTED A NET REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES LARGELY DRIVEN BY PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW LOAN GROWTH. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $161 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $736 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $22.0 BILLION, DOWN 4% DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR PERIOD WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE U.K. BANK PAYROLL TAX. NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS ALSO LOWER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH INCLUDED HIGHER LITIGATION RESERVES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSE RELATED TO BUSINESS GROWTH AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO EXITING UNPROFITABLE BUSINESS.

RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 17% ON $47.0 BILLION OF AVERAGE ALLOCATED CAPITAL.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.2 BILLION, FLAT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

ON A CLIENT SEGMENT BASIS, REVENUE FROM MIDDLE MARKET BANKING WAS $3.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $85 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER CLIENT DEPOSITS AND LOAN BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPREAD COMPRESSION ON CLIENT DEPOSITS AND LOWER LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES. REVENUE FROM COMMERCIAL TERM LENDING WAS $1.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $145 MILLION, OR 14%, AND INCLUDES THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF THE PURCHASE OF A $3.5 BILLION LOAN PORTFOLIO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010. REVENUE FROM CORPORATE CLIENT BANKING WAS $1.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $107 MILLION, OR 9% DUE TO GROWTH IN CLIENT DEPOSITS AND LOAN BALANCES AND HIGHER LENDING- AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPREAD COMPRESSION ON CLIENT DEPOSITS. REVENUE FROM REAL ESTATE BANKING WAS $416 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $44 MILLION, OR 10%, DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN LOAN BALANCES AND LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF LOANS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WIDER LOAN SPREADS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $208 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $297 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE $187 MILLION (0.18% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) COMPARED WITH $909 MILLION (0.94% NET CHARGE-OFF RATE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE REDUCTION WAS LARGELY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES TO PERIOD-END LOANS RETAINED WAS 2.34%, DOWN FROM 2.61% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NONACCRUAL LOANS WERE $1.1 BILLION, DOWN BY $947 MILLION, OR 47% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE REPAYMENTS AND LOANS SALES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $79 MILLION, OR 4% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSE.

TREASURY AND

CIO

OVERVIEW

TREASURY AND CIO ARE PREDOMINANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY, FUNDING, CAPITAL AND STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS.

TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, AMONG OTHER FUNCTIONS, FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING. FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING IS USED TO TRANSFER STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF THE FIRM TO TREASURY AND CIO AND ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS BASED ON MARKET RATES. CIO, THROUGH ITS MANAGEMENT OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, GENERATES NET INTEREST INCOME TO PAY THE LINES OF BUSINESS MARKET RATES. ANY VARIANCE (WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) BETWEEN AMOUNTS GENERATED BY CIO THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES AND AMOUNTS PAID TO OR RECEIVED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE RETAINED BY CIO, AND ARE NOT REFLECTED IN LINE OF BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS. TREASURY AND CIO ACTIVITIES OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF THE OVERALL FIRM.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE’S TOTAL ASSETS INCREASED 4% AND TOTAL LIABILITIES INCREASED 3% FROM DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL ASSETS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, REFLECTING THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LIABILITIES WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSITS, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE BALANCES; AND HIGHER SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCING THE FIRM’S ASSETS. THE INCREASE IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET INCOME.

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC LINE CAPTIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR THE LINE CAPTIONS THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, A DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGES IS ALSO INCLUDED.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AND DEPOSITS WITH BANKS

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS CASH AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE NET INCREASE REFLECTED THE PLACEMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS FUNDS WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PRIMARILY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

127–133

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; AND SECURITIES BORROWED

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT ITS CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND TO MANAGE ITS CASH POSITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED ARE USED TO PROVIDE FUNDING OR LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS THROUGH SHORT-TERM PURCHASES AND BORROWINGS OF THEIR SECURITIES BY THE FIRM. THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY; THE DECREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED REFLECTS A SHIFT IN DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS CASH TO RESALE AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY IN CIB.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

–

DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE DEBT; EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES; LOANS, INCLUDING PRIME MORTGAGES AND OTHER LOANS WAREHOUSED BY CCB AND CIB FOR SALE OR SECURITIZATION PURPOSES AND ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE; AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET (MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE). THE INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS IN 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVELS OF NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 3 ON PAGES

196–214

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

–

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. DERIVATIVES ENABLE CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE.

DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DECREASED PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS;

106

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS TO INTEREST RATE, CREDIT DERIVATIVE, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE BALANCES.

DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DECREASED PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS; THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS TO INTEREST RATE, AND CREDIT DERIVATIVE BALANCES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON PAGES

156–159

, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES

196–214

AND

218–227

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS CLASSIFIED AS AFS AND USED PRIMARILY TO MANAGE THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND TO INVEST CASH RESULTING FROM EXCESS LIQUIDITY. SECURITIES INCREASED LARGELY DUE TO REINVESTMENT AND REPOSITIONING OF THE CIO AFS PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCREASED THE LEVELS OF NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (“MBS”) AS WELL AS OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES; THE INCREASE WAS MAINLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY-ISSUED MBS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT ON PAGES

102–104

, AND NOTE 3 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES

196–214

AND

244–248

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE FIRM PROVIDES LOANS TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, TO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. LOAN BALANCES INCREASED THROUGHOUT 2012 DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF WHOLESALE LOANS, PRIMARILY IN CB AND AM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BALANCES OF CONSUMER LOANS. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE LOANS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER WHOLESALE ACTIVITY ACROSS MOST OF THE FIRM’S REGIONS AND BUSINESSES. THE DECLINE IN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOANS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO MORTGAGE-RELATED PAYDOWNS, PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF, AND NET CHARGE-OFFS. THE DECLINE IN CREDIT CARD LOANS WAS DUE TO HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, BUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE REDUCTION OCCURRED IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCES, PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO THE CONTINUING TREND OF IMPROVED DELINQUENCIES ACROSS MOST PORTFOLIOS, NOTABLY NON-PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD. THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE ALSO DECREASED,

DRIVEN BY RECOVERIES, THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS, CURRENT CREDIT TRENDS AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY.

FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

250–275

AND

276–279

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

THE FIRM’S PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT CONSIST OF LAND, BUILDINGS, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. THE INCREASE

IN PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT WAS LARGELY DUE TO RETAIL BRANCH EXPANSION IN THE U.S. AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES GLOBALLY.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MSRS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED FOR PERFORMING SPECIFIED MORTGAGE-SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR THIRD PARTIES. THE INCREASE IN THE MSR ASSET WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO ORIGINATIONS AND PURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DISPOSITIONS AND AMORTIZATION. THESE NET ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES DUE TO MARKET INTEREST RATES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER CHANGES IN VALUATION DUE TO INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MSRS, SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGES

291–295

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER ASSETS

OTHER ASSETS CONSIST OF PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER

INSTRUMENTS, CASH COLLATERAL PLEDGED, CORPORATE- AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN

SATISFACTIONS (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE OWNED), AND ALL OTHER

ASSETS. OTHER ASSETS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

DEPOSITS

DEPOSITS REPRESENT A LIABILITY TO BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS RELATED TO NON-BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS HELD ON THEIR BEHALF. DEPOSITS PROVIDE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE FIRM. THE INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WAS DUE TO GROWTH IN BOTH CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS. CONSUMER DEPOSIT BALANCES INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, LARGELY DRIVEN BY A FOCUS ON SALES ACTIVITY, LOWER ATTRITION DUE TO INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND THE IMPACT OF NETWORK EXPANSION. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES WAS DUE TO HIGHER CLIENT OPERATING BALANCES IN CIB; A HIGHER LEVEL OF SEASONAL INFLOWS AT YEAR-END IN BOTH CIB AND AM; AND IN AM, CLIENTS REALIZING CAPITAL GAINS IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGES IN U.S. TAX RATES; THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BALANCES RELATED TO CHANGES IN FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE FIRM USES THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND TO SUPPORT ITS CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE USED BY THE FIRM AS SHORT-TERM FUNDING SOURCES AND TO PROVIDE SECURITIES TO CLIENTS FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY PURPOSES. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER SECURED FINANCING OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS. FOR ADDITIONAL

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS

THE FIRM USES COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS IN ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, AND IN CONNECTION WITH A CIB LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, WHEREBY CLIENTS CHOOSE TO SWEEP THEIR DEPOSITS INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER. COMMERCIAL PAPER INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE FROM WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES RELATED TO CIB’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT. OTHER BORROWED FUNDS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER SECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, SEE PAGES

127–133

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES CONSIST OF PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS; PAYABLES TO BROKERS, DEALERS AND CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS; PAYABLES FROM FAILED SECURITIES PURCHASES; INCOME TAXES PAYABLE; ACCRUED EXPENSE, INCLUDING INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES; AND ALL OTHER LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES AND OBLIGATIONS TO RETURN SECURITIES RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES DECREASED PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER CIB CLIENT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLES AND LITIGATION RESERVES RELATED TO MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 20 ON PAGE

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES REPRESENT INTEREST-BEARING BENEFICIAL-INTEREST LIABILITIES, WHICH DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO CREDIT CARD MATURITIES AND A REDUCTION IN OUTSTANDING CONDUIT COMMERCIAL PAPER HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW CREDIT CARD ISSUANCES AND NEW CONSOLIDATED MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FIRM-SPONSORED VIES AND LOAN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, SEE OFF–BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AND NOTE 16 ON PAGES

280–291

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

THE FIRM USES LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING TRUPS AND LONG-TERM FHLB ADVANCES) TO PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDS AND AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF TRUPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITIES, SEE THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

127–133

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY INCREASED, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET INCOME; A NET INCREASE IN AOCI DRIVEN BY NET UNREALIZED MARKET VALUE INCREASES ON AFS SECURITIES, PREDOMINANTLY NON-U.S. RESIDENTIAL MBS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REALIZED GAINS; ISSUANCES AND COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE UNDER THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS; AND THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REPURCHASES OF COMMON EQUITY, AND THE DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF–BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGH NONCONSOLIDATED SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (“SPES”), WHICH ARE A TYPE OF VIE, AND THROUGH LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS AN SPE. SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-B

A

CKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, AS THEY PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS’ ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. SPES MAY BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY ESTABLISHED FOR A SINGLE, DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES SPES AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR ITSELF AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND BY CREATING INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH SPES THROUGH MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, AND LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

280–291

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE TYPES OF SPES.

THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARM’S LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING. CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRM’S CODE OF CONDUCT. THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

IMPLICATIONS OF A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF ITS SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY “P-1”, “A-1” AND “F1” FOR MOODY’S, STANDARD & POOR’S AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS SUPPORT THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER BY BOTH FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED AND THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED NONCONSOLIDATED SPES. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ABSENT OTHER SOLUTIONS, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE SPE, IF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER COULD NOT BE

REISSUED AS IT MATURED. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, ISSUED BY BOTH FIRM-ADMINISTERED AND THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED SPES, THAT ARE HELD BY THIRD PARTIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, WAS $18.1 BILLION

AND

$19.7 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING COULD INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD CLIENTS OF THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONSOLIDATED OR THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED NONCONSOLIDATED SPES DRAW DOWN ON CERTAIN UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE

$10.9 BILLION

AND

$11.0 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM COULD FACILITATE THE REFINANCING OF SOME OF THE CLIENTS’ ASSETS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FUNDING OBLIGATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES

284–285

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM ALSO ACTS AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR CERTAIN MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. THE FIRM’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

280–291

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC (THE “GSES”) AND OTHER MORTGAGE LOAN SALE AND PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS MADE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. FOR TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES, THESE REPRESENTATIONS RELATE TO TYPE OF COLLATERAL, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, VALIDITY OF CERTAIN BORROWER REPRESENTATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN, PRIMARY MORTGAGE INSURANCE BEING IN FORCE FOR ANY MORTGAGE LOAN WITH A LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIO GREATER THAN 80% AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINATION DATE, AND THE USE OF THE GSES’ STANDARD LEGAL DOCUMENTATION. THE FIRM MAY BE, AND HAS BEEN, REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE GSES AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT ARE RECEIVED RELATE TO LOANS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES THAT REMAIN VIABLE, THE FIRM TYPICALLY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE RELATED THIRD PARTY.

TO DATE, THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS THE FIRM HAS RECEIVED FROM THE GSES PRIMARILY RELATE TO LOANS ORIGINATED FROM 2005 TO 2008. REPURCHASES RESULTING FROM DEMANDS AGAINST PRE-2005 AND POST-2008 VINTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT; THE FIRM ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THE COMPARATIVELY FAVORABLE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THESE VINTAGES AND TO THE ENHANCED UNDERWRITING AND LOAN QUALIFICATION STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED PROGRESSIVELY DURING 2007 AND 2008. FROM 2005 TO 2008, EXCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM MAY BE LIABLE WAS APPROXIMATELY

$380 BILLION

(THIS AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY, SUCH AS BORROWER REPAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL OR REPURCHASES COMPLETED TO DATE). SEE THE DISCUSSION BELOW FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PROCESS THE FIRM USES TO EVALUATE REPURCHASE DEMANDS FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AND THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES RELATED TO SUCH EXPOSURE.

FROM 2005 TO 2008, WASHINGTON MUTUAL SOLD APPROXIMATELY $150 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF LOANS TO THE GSES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRM’S ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE FDIC IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED AND/OR LIMITED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS FOR LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE FIRM’S POSITION THAT SUCH OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT IT HAS NO REMAINING EXPOSURE RELATED TO LOANS SOLD BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO THE GSES.

THE FIRM ALSO SELLS LOANS IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE; THESE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE FIRM, IN ITS ROLE AS SERVICER, MAY ELECT, BUT IS TYPICALLY NOT REQUIRED, TO REPURCHASE DELINQUENT LOANS SECURITIZED BY GINNIE MAE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD BACK TO GINNIE MAE

SUBSEQUENT TO MODIFICATION. BECAUSE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE REPURCHASED LOANS CONTINUE TO BE INSURED AND THE REIMBURSEMENT OF INSURED AMOUNTS CONTINUES TO PROCEED NORMALLY, THE FIRM HAS NOT RECORDED ANY MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE LOANS. HOWEVER, THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION’S DIRECT ENDORSEMENT PROGRAM. THE FIRM IS COOPERATING IN THAT INVESTIGATION.

FROM 2005 TO 2008, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED ENTITIES MADE CERTAIN LOAN LEVEL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH APPROXIMATELY

$450 BILLION

OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS THAT WERE SOLD OR DEPOSITED INTO PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS. WHILE THE TERMS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS VARY, THEY GENERALLY DIFFER FROM LOAN SALES TO THE GSES IN THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) IN ORDER TO DIRECT THE TRUSTEE TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL CLAIMS, THE SECURITY HOLDERS MUST MAKE A FORMAL REQUEST FOR THE TRUSTEE TO DO SO, AND TYPICALLY, THIS REQUIRES AGREEMENT OF THE HOLDERS OF A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES; (II) GENERALLY, THE MORTGAGE LOANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET ALL GSE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; AND (III) IN MANY CASES, THE PARTY DEMANDING REPURCHASE IS REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOAN-LEVEL BREACH OF A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HAS MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE VALUE OF THE LOAN. OF THE

$450 BILLION

ORIGINALLY SOLD OR DEPOSITED (INCLUDING

$165 BILLION

BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, AS TO WHICH THE FIRM MAINTAINS THAT CERTAIN OF THE REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP), APPROXIMATELY

$197 BILLION

OF PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN REPAID (INCLUDING

$72 BILLION

RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL). IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY

$118 BILLION

OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH LOANS HAS BEEN LIQUIDATED (INCLUDING

$43 BILLION

RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL), WITH AN AVERAGE LOSS SEVERITY OF

60%

. ACCORDINGLY, THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THESE LOANS (INCLUDING WASHINGTON MUTUAL) WAS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, APPROXIMATELY

$135 BILLION

, OF WHICH

$39 BILLION

WAS 60 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE. THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF LOANS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL WAS APPROXIMATELY

$50 BILLION

, OF WHICH

$14 BILLION

WERE 60 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE.

THERE HAVE BEEN GENERALIZED ALLEGATIONS, AS WELL AS SPECIFIC DEMANDS, THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASE LOANS SOLD OR DEPOSITED INTO PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS (INCLUDING CLAIMS FROM INSURERS THAT HAVE GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS). ALTHOUGH THE FIRM ENCOURAGES PARTIES TO USE THE CONTRACTUAL REPURCHASE PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN THE GOVERNING AGREEMENTS, THESE PRIVATE-LABEL REPURCHASE CLAIMS HAVE GENERALLY MANIFESTED THEMSELVES THROUGH THREATENED OR PENDING LITIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE LIABILITY RELATED TO REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THE PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY THE FIRM IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

REPURCHASE DEMAND PROCESS - GSES

THE FIRM FIRST BECOMES AWARE THAT A GSE IS EVALUATING A PARTICULAR LOAN FOR REPURCHASE WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES A FILE REQUEST FROM THE GSE. UPON COMPLETING ITS REVIEW, THE GSE MAY SUBMIT A REPURCHASE DEMAND TO THE FIRM; HISTORICALLY, MOST FILE REQUESTS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN REPURCHASE DEMANDS.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES RELATE TO ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS PRIMARILY ARISING FROM: (I) CREDIT QUALITY AND/OR UNDISCLOSED DEBT OF THE BORROWER; (II) INCOME LEVEL AND/OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THE BORROWER; AND (III) APPRAISED VALUE OF COLLATERAL. INELIGIBILITY OF THE BORROWER FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT, MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS AND MISSING DOCUMENTATION ARE OTHER REASONS FOR REPURCHASE DEMANDS. THE SUCCESSFUL RESCISSION OF MORTGAGE INSURANCE TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A VIOLATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO THE GSES AND, THEREFORE, HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES. THE FIRM ACTIVELY REVIEWS ALL RESCISSION NOTICES FROM MORTGAGE INSURERS AND CONTESTS THEM WHEN APPROPRIATE.

AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER RECEIVING A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM A GSE, THE FIRM EVALUATES THE REQUEST AND TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTIONS BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE REPURCHASE DEMAND. LOAN-LEVEL APPEALS WITH THE GSES ARE TYPICAL AND THE FIRM SEEKS TO RESOLVE THE REPURCHASE DEMAND (I.E., EITHER REPURCHASE THE LOAN OR HAVE THE REPURCHASE DEMAND RESCINDED) WITHIN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OF THE DATE OF RECEIPT. IN MANY CASES, THE FIRM ULTIMATELY IS NOT REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE A LOAN BECAUSE IT IS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE PURPORTED DEFECT. ALTHOUGH REPURCHASE DEMANDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE LOAN IS PAID IN FULL, THE MAJORITY OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES HAVE HISTORICALLY RELATED TO LOANS THAT BECAME DELINQUENT IN THE FIRST 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING ORIGINATION. MORE RECENTLY, THE FIRM HAS OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES WITH RESPECT TO LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAVE MADE MORE THAN 24 MONTHS OF PAYMENTS BEFORE DEFAULTING.

WHEN THE FIRM ACCEPTS A REPURCHASE DEMAND FROM ONE OF THE GSES, THE FIRM MAY EITHER (I) REPURCHASE THE LOAN OR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL FROM THE GSE AT THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, OR (II) REIMBURSE THE GSE FOR ITS REALIZED LOSS ON A LIQUIDATED PROPERTY (A “MAKE-WHOLE” PAYMENT).

ESTIMATED MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, WHICH ARE PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL REPURCHASE EXPERIENCE WITH THE GSES.

(I)

THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMANDS,

(II)

ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS, CONSIDERING INFORMATION ABOUT FILE REQUESTS, DELINQUENT AND LIQUIDATED LOANS, RESOLVED AND UNRESOLVED MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES AND THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

(III)

THE POTENTIAL ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS (“CURE RATE”),

(IV)

THE ESTIMATED SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OF THE LOAN OR COLLATERAL, MAKE-WHOLE SETTLEMENT, OR INDEMNIFICATION,

(V)

THE FIRM’S POTENTIAL ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS LOSSES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, AND

(VI)

THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURERS AND OTHER PARTIES.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED A MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF

$2.8 BILLION

AND

$3.6 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO COVER REPURCHASE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ALL LOANS PREVIOUSLY SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THOSE LOSSES OCCUR OR HOW THEY ARE ULTIMATELY RESOLVED (E.G., REPURCHASE, MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT). WHILE UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUE TO EXIST WITH RESPECT TO BOTH GSE BEHAVIOR AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE MODEL INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT USES TO ESTIMATE ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SEASONED AND STABLE. BASED ON THESE MODEL INPUTS, WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AND ALSO CONSIDERING PROJECTIONS REGARDING FUTURE UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING THE GSES’ CURRENT BEHAVIOR, THE FIRM HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONFIDENT IN ITS ABILITY TO ESTIMATE RELIABLY ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY. FOR THESE REASONS, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE LOSSES ARISING FROM LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES.

THE TABLE INCLUDES REPURCHASE DEMANDS RECEIVED FROM THE GSES AS WELL AS REPURCHASE DEMANDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE FIRM BY TRUSTEES WHO ASSERT AUTHORITY TO PRESENT SUCH CLAIMS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING SALE OR SECURITIZATION AGREEMENT (BUT EXCLUDES REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSERTED IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH PENDING REPURCHASE LITIGATION). HOWEVER, ALL MORTGAGE REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS (HOWEVER ASSERTED) ARE EVALUATED BY THE FIRM IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY.

THE DECREASE FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 PREDOMINANTLY RELATES TO REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS THAT HAD BEEN PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 BUT THAT SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE LITIGATION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012; SUCH REPURCHASE DEMANDS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS TABLE.

(B)

BECAUSE THE GSES AND OTHERS MAY MAKE REPURCHASE DEMANDS BASED ON MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED, CERTAIN LOANS MAY BE SUBJECT TO BOTH AN UNRESOLVED MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICE AND AN OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE DEMAND.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT REPURCHASE DEMANDS AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES RECEIVED BY LOAN ORIGINATION VINTAGE, EXCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL, FOR THE PAST FIVE QUARTERS. THE FIRM EXPECTS REPURCHASE DEMANDS TO REMAIN AT ELEVATED LEVELS OR TO INCREASE IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PRIVATE-LABEL REPURCHASE DEMANDS OUTSIDE OF PENDING REPURCHASE LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE FIRM CONSIDERS FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS, INCLUDING THIS POTENTIAL VOLATILITY, IN ESTIMATING ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

113

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2011, THE FIRM’S CUMULATIVE CURE RATE (EXCLUDING LOANS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL) HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY

60%

. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS NOW RELATE TO LOANS WITH A LONGER PAY HISTORY, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE HAD HIGHER CURE RATES. REPURCHASES THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIRM’S OVERALL CURE RATE. WHILE THE ACTUAL CURE RATE MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT THE CUMULATIVE CURE RATE WILL REMAIN IN THE

55-65%

RANGE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE FIRM HAS NOT OBSERVED A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TYPE OF DEFECT THAT ALLEGEDLY CAUSES THE BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND THE SEVERITY OF THE REALIZED LOSS. THEREFORE, THE LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTION IS ESTIMATED USING THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING CHANGES IN HOME PRICES. ACTUAL PRINCIPAL LOSS SEVERITIES ON FINALIZED REPURCHASES AND “MAKE-WHOLE” SETTLEMENTS TO DATE (EXCLUDING LOANS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL) CURRENTLY AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY

50%

, BUT MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CHANGES IN HOME PRICES.

WHEN A LOAN WAS ORIGINATED BY A THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATOR, THE FIRM TYPICALLY HAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK A RECOVERY OF RELATED REPURCHASE LOSSES FROM THE THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATOR. ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY RECOVERY RATES MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING MIX OF THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS (E.G., ACTIVE, INACTIVE, OUT-OF-BUSINESS ORIGINATORS) FROM WHICH RECOVERIES ARE BEING SOUGHT.

THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH TWO MORTGAGE INSURERS TO RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS ON CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS A SERVICER. THESE TWO AGREEMENTS COVER AND HAVE RESOLVED APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE FIRM’S TOTAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION RISK EXPOSURE, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SERVICED LOANS COVERED BY MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE IMPACT OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS REFLECTED IN THE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AND THE OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, DISCLOSED ON THE PRIOR PAGE. THE FIRM HAS CONSIDERED ITS REMAINING UNRESOLVED MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION RISK EXPOSURE IN ESTIMATING THE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTING ITS RECORDED MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY — INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE FUTURE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES (BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE GSES’ FUTURE BEHAVIOR), THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE IDENTIFIED DEFECTS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE AND RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES — REQUIRE APPLICATION OF A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. WHILE THE FIRM USES THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT IN ESTIMATING ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY, THIS ESTIMATE IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND IMPRECISE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE POSITION. THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRATEGY FOCUSES ON LONG-TERM STABILITY, WHICH ENABLES THE FIRM TO BUILD AND INVEST IN MARKET-LEADING BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SENIOR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRENGTH. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S EARNINGS OUTLOOK, SENIOR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL WITH A VIEW TO PRESERVING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL STRENGTH. MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET TO MANAGE THROUGH ECONOMIC VOLATILITY IS CONSIDERED A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CEO AND OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FIRM’S BALANCE SHEET PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, STRONG CAPITAL AND RESERVES, AND ROBUST LIQUIDITY.

THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO HOLD CAPITAL SUFFICIENT TO.

•

COVER ALL MATERIAL RISKS UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;

•

MAINTAIN “WELL-CAPITALIZED” STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

•

MAINTAIN DEBT RATINGS THAT ENABLE THE FIRM TO OPTIMIZE ITS FUNDING MIX AND LIQUIDITY SOURCES WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS;

•

RETAIN FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES; AND

•

BUILD AND INVEST IN BUSINESSES, EVEN IN A HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

THESE OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH ONGOING MONITORING OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION, REGULAR STRESS TESTING, AND A CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO REACT TO A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EVENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS FREQUENT FIRMWIDE AND LOB PROCESSES FOR ONGOING MONITORING AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ITS CAPITAL POSITION.

CAPITAL GOVERNANCE

THE FIRM’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF A CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT SUPPORTS STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED THE REGULATORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE (“RCMO”) WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING AND REPORTING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL AND RELATED RISKS. THE RCMO IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL CAPITAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING, APPROVING AND MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POLICIES AND STRATEGIES, AS WELL AS ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE ASSESSES THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND ITS COMPONENTS. THIS REVIEW ENCOMPASSES EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE RISK TOLERANCE LEVELS, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

123–126

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS

SEMIANNUALLY, THE FIRM COMPLETES THE INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS (“ICAAP”), WHICH PROVIDES MANAGEMENT WITH A VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF SEVERE AND UNEXPECTED EVENTS ON EARNINGS, BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS, RESERVES AND CAPITAL. THE FIRM’S ICAAP INTEGRATES STRESS TESTING PROTOCOLS WITH CAPITAL PLANNING.

THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON THE FIRM’S EARNINGS AND CAPITAL. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE KEY DRIVERS OF BUSINESS RESULTS; GLOBAL MARKET SHOCKS, WHICH GENERATE SHORT-TERM BUT SEVERE TRADING LOSSES; AND IDIOSYNCRATIC OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. THE SCENARIOS ARE INTENDED TO CAPTURE AND STRESS KEY VULNERABILITIES AND IDIOSYNCRATIC RISKS FACING THE FIRM. HOWEVER, WHEN DEFINING A BROAD RANGE OF SCENARIOS, REALIZED EVENTS CAN ALWAYS BE WORSE. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS, AS NECESSARY. ICAAP RESULTS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”)

THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUIRES LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE FIRM, TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE USES THE CCAR AND DODD-FRANK ACT WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”) STRESS TEST PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS, AND HAVE ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT ADDRESS EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S UNIQUE RISKS TO ENABLE THEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB LOSSES UNDER CERTAIN STRESS SCENARIOS. THROUGH THE CCAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE EVALUATES EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANY’S CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESSES, AS WELL AS ITS PLANS TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OR STOCK REPURCHASES.

THE FIRM’S CCAR PROCESS IS INTEGRATED INTO AND EMPLOYS THE SAME METHODOLOGIES UTILIZED IN THE FIRM’S ICAAP PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS 2012 CAPITAL PLAN ON JANUARY 9, 2012, AND RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S NON-OBJECTION ON MARCH 13, 2012. THE FIRM INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS COMMON EQUITY TO $0.30 PER SHARE COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, AND DURING 2012 REPURCHASED (ON A TRADE-DATE BASIS)

31 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND

18 MILLION

WARRANTS FOR

$1.3 BILLION

AND

$238 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. FOLLOWING THE VOLUNTARY CESSATION OF ITS COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN MAY 2012, THE FIRM RESUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE 2012 CCAR PROCESS IN AUGUST 2012. PURSUANT TO A NON-OBJECTION RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2012, WITH RESPECT TO THE RESUBMITTED CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM IS AUTHORIZED TO

116

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

REPURCHASE UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF COMMON EQUITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TIMING AND EXACT AMOUNT OF ANY COMMON EQUITY TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION; ORGANIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES; AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM SUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S 2013 CCAR PROCESS. THE FIRM’S PLAN RELATES TO THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2013 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 (THAT IS, THE 2013 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN RELATES TO DIVIDENDS TO BE DECLARED COMMENCING IN JUNE 2013, AND TO COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASES AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIONS COMMENCING APRIL 1, 2013). THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S RESPONSE TO ITS PLAN NO LATER THAN MARCH 14, 2013. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL DECLARE THE REGULAR QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER SHARE FOR THE 2013 FIRST QUARTER AT ITS BOARD MEETING TO BE HELD ON MARCH 19, 2013. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ACTIONS, SEE CAPITAL ACTIONS ON PAGE

122

, AND NOTES 22 AND 23 ON PAGES

300

AND

300–301

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CAPITAL DISCIPLINES

THE FIRM ASSESSES CAPITAL BASED ON.

•

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

•

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL ASSESSMENT

•

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY ATTRIBUTION

REGULATORY CAPITAL IS THE CAPITAL REQUIRED TO BE HELD BY THE FIRM PURSUANT TO THE STANDARDS STIPULATED BY U.S. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. REGULATORY CAPITAL IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AT JPMORGAN CHASE, AS REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES ARE THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECTS OR DOES NOT OBJECT TO THE FIRM’S PLANNED CAPITAL ACTIONS AS SET FORTH IN THE FIRM’S CCAR SUBMISSION.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL IS ASSESSED BY EVALUATING THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES USING INTERNAL RISK EVALUATION METHODS. THESE METHODS RESULT IN CAPITAL ALLOCATIONS FOR BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND AGGREGATED LOB TRANSACTIONS AND CAN BE GROUPED INTO FOUR MAIN CATEGORIES.

•

CREDIT RISK

•

MARKET RISK

•

OPERATIONAL RISK

•

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK

THESE INTERNAL CALCULATIONS RESULT IN THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO COVER JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE EVENT OF UNEXPECTED LOSSES.

IN DETERMINING LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY THE FIRM EVALUATES THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THE LINE OF BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS

DISCUSSED BELOW), ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS, FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“OCC”) ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRM’S NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

BASEL

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE CAPITAL ACCORD (“BASEL I”) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (“BASEL COMMITTEE”). IN 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED A REVISION TO THE CAPITAL ACCORD (“BASEL II”). THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO PROVIDE MORE RISK-SENSITIVE REGULATORY CAPITAL CALCULATIONS AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS PUBLISHED A FINAL BASEL II RULE IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH REQUIRES JPMORGAN CHASE TO IMPLEMENT BASEL II AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT CERTAIN OF ITS KEY U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

PRIOR TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A QUALIFICATION PERIOD OF AT LEAST FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS DURING WHICH IT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE TO THE SATISFACTION OF ITS U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. JPMORGAN CHASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE QUALIFICATION PERIOD AND EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT, BASED ON VARIOUS ESTABLISHED TIMELINES, BASEL II RULES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AS REQUIRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN 2009 (“SCAP”), U.S. BANKING REGULATORS DEVELOPED AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF CAPITAL, TIER 1 COMMON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL LESS ELEMENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL NOT IN THE FORM OF COMMON EQUITY, SUCH AS PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE EMPLOYS A MINIMUM 5% TIER 1 COMMON RATIO STANDARD FOR CCAR PURPOSES, IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER BASEL I.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE REGULATORY CAPITAL, ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, UNDER BASEL I. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND EACH MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH IT WAS SUBJECT.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE ADJUSTMENT TO RWA DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CERTAIN MARKET RISK MODELS AND A REDUCTION IN RELATED POSITIONS.

IN JUNE 2012, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES PUBLISHED FINAL RULES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2013, THAT PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRADING POSITIONS AND SECURITIZATIONS (“BASEL 2.5”). IT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE FROM THE FIRM’S BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON RATIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 (ALL OTHER FACTORS BEING CONSTANT).

IN JUNE 2012, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ALSO PUBLISHED A NOTICE FOR PROPOSED RULEMAKING (“NPR”) FOR

118

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

IMPLEMENTING FURTHER REVISIONS TO THE CAPITAL ACCORD IN THE U.S. (SUCH FURTHER REVISIONS ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “BASEL III”). BASEL III REVISED BASEL II BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL, AND INCREASING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC EXPOSURES. BASEL III ALSO INCLUDES HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDES THAT THE TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENT WILL BE INCREASED TO 7%, COMPRISED OF A MINIMUM RATIO OF 4.5% PLUS A 2.5% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 7% TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENT IS REQUIRED BY JANUARY 1, 2019.

IN ADDITION, GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (“GSIBS”) WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TIER 1 COMMON REQUIREMENTS ABOVE THE 7% MINIMUM IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM AN ADDITIONAL 1% TO AN ADDITIONAL 2.5%. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (“FSB”) INDICATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THE FIRM, AS WELL AS THREE OTHER BANKS, TO HOLD THE ADDITIONAL 2.5% OF TIER 1 COMMON; THE REQUIREMENT WILL BE PHASED IN BEGINNING IN 2016. THE BASEL COMMITTEE ALSO STATED IT INTENDED TO REQUIRE CERTAIN GSIBS TO HOLD AN ADDITIONAL 1% OF TIER 1 COMMON UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ACT AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR THE GSIB FROM TAKING ACTIONS THAT WOULD FURTHER INCREASE ITS SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE. CURRENTLY, NO GSIB (INCLUDING THE FIRM) IS REQUIRED TO HOLD THIS ADDITIONAL 1% OF TIER 1 COMMON.

IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE PROPOSED CERTAIN PERMANENT BASEL I FLOORS UNDER BASEL II AND BASEL III CAPITAL CALCULATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A COMPARISON OF THE FIRM’S TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL I RULES TO ITS ESTIMATED TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL III RULES, ALONG WITH THE FIRM’S ESTIMATED RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 1 COMMON UNDER BASEL III INCLUDES ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS AND DEDUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN BASEL I TIER 1 COMMON, SUCH AS THE INCLUSION OF AOCI RELATED TO AFS SECURITIES AND DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (“OPEB”) PLANS.

THE FIRM ESTIMATES THAT ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL III RULES WOULD BE

8.7%

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BOTH BASEL I AND BASEL III ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, SUCH MEASURES ARE USED BY BANK REGULATORS, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS AS A KEY MEASURE TO ASSESS THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION AND TO COMPARE THE FIRM’S CAPITAL TO THAT OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.

KEY DIFFERENCES IN THE CALCULATION OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS BETWEEN BASEL I AND BASEL III INCLUDE: (1) BASEL III CREDIT RISK RWA IS BASED ON RISK-SENSITIVE APPROACHES WHICH LARGELY RELY ON THE USE OF INTERNAL

CREDIT MODELS AND PARAMETERS, WHEREAS BASEL I RWA IS BASED ON FIXED SUPERVISORY RISK WEIGHTINGS WHICH VARY ONLY BY COUNTERPARTY TYPE AND ASSET CLASS; (2) BASEL III MARKET RISK RWA REFLECTS THE NEW CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO TRADING ASSETS AND SECURITIZATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE INCREMENTAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STRESS VAR, CORRELATION TRADING, AND RE-SECURITIZATION POSITIONS; AND (3) BASEL III INCLUDES RWA FOR OPERATIONAL RISK, WHEREAS BASEL I DOES NOT. THE ACTUAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CAPITAL RATIOS UPON IMPLEMENTATION COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON FINAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FROM THE REGULATORS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MODELS.

(B)

THE TIER 1 COMMON RATIO IS TIER 1 COMMON DIVIDED BY RWA.

THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF ITS TIER 1 COMMON RATIO UNDER BASEL III REFLECTS ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASEL III RULES BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY PUBLISHED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND ON THE APPLICATION OF SUCH RULES TO ITS BUSINESSES AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED; IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES THE FIRM MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE TO ITS BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE BASEL III RULES, POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS TO CERTAIN MARKET RISK MODELS, AND ANY FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FROM THE REGULATORS.

THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PROLONGED TRANSITION PERIODS. THE TRANSITION PERIOD FOR BANKS TO MEET THE TIER 1 COMMON REQUIREMENT UNDER BASEL III WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN 2013, WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE U.S. FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ANNOUNCED A DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION DATES FOR THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GSIBS WILL BE PHASED IN STARTING JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY 1, 2019. MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT OBJECTIVE IS FOR THE FIRM TO REACH, BY THE END OF 2013, AN ESTIMATED BASEL III TIER I COMMON RATIO OF 9.5%.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (CIB, CB AND AM) AND CONSUMER BUSINESS (CCB).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND FROM DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION, MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN “AA” CREDIT RATING STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THOSE FOR WHICH THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS MAINTAINED. THE CAPITAL METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE AT DEFAULT (OR LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT),

DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD, CREDIT SPREADS, LOSS SEVERITY AND PORTFOLIO CORRELATION.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT-LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH AN “AA” CREDIT RATING STANDARD. THE DECREASE IN CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IN 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY CONSUMER PORTFOLIO RUNOFF AND CONTINUED MODEL ENHANCEMENTS TO BETTER ESTIMATE FUTURE STRESS CREDIT LOSSES IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO. SEE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

134–135

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE CREDIT RISK MEASURES.

MARKET RISK CAPITA

L

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, AND SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES PRICES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. RESULTS FROM DAILY VAR, WEEKLY STRESS TESTS, ISSUER CREDIT SPREADS AND DEFAULT RISK CALCULATIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS, ARE USED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. MARKET RISK CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT BASED ON ITS RISK ASSESSMENT. THE INCREASE IN MARKET RISK CAPITAL IN 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED RISK IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. SEE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

163–169

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE MARKET RISK MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITA

L

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED ON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED LOSSES, WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. THE INCREASE IN OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL IN 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED MODEL ENHANCEMENTS TO BETTER CAPTURE LARGE HISTORICAL LOSS EVENTS, INCLUDING MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION COSTS. THE INCREASES THAT OCCURRED DURING 2012 WILL BE FULLY REFLECTED IN AVERAGE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL IN 2013. SEE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

175–176

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATIONAL RISK.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY- AND PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS, AND COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, WITHIN THE CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SEGMENT, TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NEGATIVE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, POTENTIAL LOSSES IN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS CAN BE MAGNIFIED BY LIQUIDITY RISK.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRM’S FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.

•

INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE AND LINE OF BUSINESS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES;

•

MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS; AND

•

PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS

IN DETERMINING LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY THE FIRM EVALUATES THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THE LINE OF BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY

, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III TIER 1 COMMON CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS DISCUSSED BELOW), ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. CAPITAL IS ALSO ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS EFFECTED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS. ROE IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS KEY MEASURES OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT’S PERFORMANCE.

COMMON EQUITY (I.E., COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS) REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OF WHICH

$8.95 BILLION

WAS AUTHORIZED FOR REPURCHASE IN 2011. ON MARCH 13, 2012, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW

$15.0 BILLION

COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OF WHICH UP TO

$12.0 BILLION

WAS APPROVED FOR REPURCHASE IN 2012 AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

$3.0 BILLION

WAS APPROVED THROUGH THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. FOLLOWING THE VOLUNTARY CESSATION OF ITS COMMON EQUITY REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN MAY 2012, THE FIRM RESUBMITTED ITS CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE 2012 CCAR PROCESS IN AUGUST 2012. PURSUANT TO A NON-OBJECTION RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2012, WITH RESPECT TO THE RESUBMITTED CAPITAL PLAN, THE FIRM IS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO

$3.0 BILLION

OF COMMON EQUITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE TIMING AND EXACT AMOUNT OF ANY COMMON EQUITY TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION; ORGANIC AND OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES; AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF THE WARRANTS DURING

2010.

THE FIRM MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE 10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE REPURCHASES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE ITS EQUITY DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REPURCHASING COMMON EQUITY — FOR EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING “BLACK-OUT PERIODS.” ALL PURCHASES UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN ESTABLISHED WHEN THE FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

THE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE COMMON EQUITY WILL BE UTILIZED AT MANAGEMENT’S DISCRETION, AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND THE EXACT AMOUNT OF COMMON EQUITY THAT MAY BE REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRM’S CAPITAL POSITION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRICE TARGETS OR TIMETABLES; MAY BE EXECUTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR UTILIZING RULE 10B5-1 PROGRAMS; AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME.

RISK MANAGEMENT

RI

SK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT INTENDED TO ENSURE THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF RISK TYPES ARE CONSIDERED IN MANAGING ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO CREATE A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE FIRM WHERE COLLABORATION, DISCUSSION, ESCALATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION ARE ENCOURAGED.

THE FIRM’S OVERALL RISK APPETITE IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL, EARNINGS POWER, AND DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS MODEL. THE FIRM EMPLOYS A FORMALIZED RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE THE FIRM’S OBJECTIVES WITH RETURN TARGETS, RISK CONTROLS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THE FIRM’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (“CEO”) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE OVERALL FIRMWIDE RISK APPETITE. THE LINES OF BUSINESS CEOS, CHIEF RISK OFFICERS (“CROS”) AND CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY SENIOR MANAGEMENT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE RISK APPETITE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE LINES OF BUSINESS OR RISK LIMITS, WITHIN THE FIRM’S LIMITS,

AND THESE RISK LIMITS ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CEO AND FIRMWIDE CHIEF RISK OFFICER (“CRO”) OR THE DEPUTY CRO. THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES THE RISK APPETITE POLICY ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRM’S RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS, ALBEIT WITH APPROPRIATE CORPORATE OVERSIGHT. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS REGARDING THE BUSINESS’ RISK STRATEGY, POLICIES AS APPROPRIATE AND CONTROLS. THERE ARE NINE MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED ARISING OUT OF THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, COUNTRY RISK, PRINCIPAL RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK AND REPUTATION RISK.

OVERLAYING LINE OF BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT ARE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS WITH RISK MANAGEMENT-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES: RISK MANAGEMENT, TREASURY AND CIO, THE REGULATORY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE (“RCMO”)

THE

FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE AND THE FIRMWIDE VALUATION GOVERNANCE FORUM.

RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS INDEPENDENTLY OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS, AND IS VIEWED AS A PARTNER IN ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS RISK AND REWARD OBJECTIVES. RISK MANAGEMENT COORDINATES AND COMMUNICATES WITH EACH LINE OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES AND CROS TO MANAGE RISK. THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS HEADED BY THE FIRM’S CHIEF RISK OFFICER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF

THE FIRM’S OPERATING COMMITTEE AND WHO REPORTS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE. THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES. WITHIN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION ARE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, COUNTRY RISK, PRINCIPAL RISK, MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, AS WELL AS RISK REPORTING AND RISK POLICY. RISK MANAGEMENT IS SUPPORTED BY RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO MONITOR AND MANAGE RISK.

THE RISK MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION MAINTAINS A RISK OPERATING COMMITTEE AND THE RISK MANAGEMENT BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEES. THE RISK OPERATING COMMITTEE FOCUSES ON RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SETTING RISK MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES, ESCALATION OF RISK ISSUES, TALENT AND RESOURCING, AND OTHER ISSUES BROUGHT TO ITS ATTENTION BY LINE OF BUSINESS CEOS, CROS AND CROSS-LINE OF BUSINESS RISK OFFICERS (E.G., COUNTRY RISK, MARKET RISK AND MODEL RISK). THIS COMMITTEE MEETS BI-WEEKLY AND IS LED BY THE CRO OR DEPUTY-CRO. THERE ARE THREE BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEES WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION (WHOLESALE RISK BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEE, CONSUMER RISK BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEE AND THE CORPORATE RISK BUSINESS CONTROL COMMITTEE) WHICH MEET AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND FOCUS ON THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING OUTSTANDING ACTION PLANS, AUDIT STATUS, OPERATIONAL RISK STATISTICS (SUCH AS LOSSES, RISK INDICATORS, ETC.), COMPLIANCE WITH CRITICAL CONTROL PROGRAMS, AND RISK TECHNOLOGY.

THE MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT, WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK POLICY, GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO A MODEL’S APPROPRIATE USAGE AND CONDUCTS INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF MODELS.

TREASURY AND CIO ARE PREDOMINANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY, FUNDING, CAPITAL AND STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS. RCMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, AND REPORTING THE FIRM’S CAPITAL AND RELATED RISKS.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE HAS OVERSIGHT FOR LEGAL RISK. IN JANUARY 2013, THE COMPLIANCE FUNCTION WAS MOVED TO REPORT TO THE FIRM’S CO-COOS IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN THE FUNCTION, WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF HOW THE FIRM MANAGES ITS RISK, WITH THE F

IRM’S OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTION. COMPLIANCE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH LEGAL, GIVEN THEIR COMPLEMENTARY MISSIONS. THE FIRM’S OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP IS DEDICATED TO ENHANCING THE FIRM’S CONTROL FRAMEWORK, AND TO LOOKING WITHIN AND ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING CIO) TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE CONTROL ISSUES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

123

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS A FIRM-WIDE VALUATION GOVERNANCE FORUM (“VGF”) COMPRISING SENIOR FINANCE AND RISK EXECUTIVES TO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM VALUATION ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED

ACROSS THE FIRM. THE VGF IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRM-WIDE HEAD OF THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION, AND ALSO INCLUDES SUB-FORUMS FOR THE CIB, MB, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING TREASURY AND CIO.

IN ADDITION TO THE RISK COMMITTEES OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE ABOVE-REFERENCED RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO HAS NUMEROUS MANAGEMENT LEVEL COMMITTEES FOCUSED ON MEASURING, MONITORING AND MANAGING RISK.

ALL OF THESE COMMITTEES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE CEO AND OPERATING

COMMITTEE. THE MEMBERSHIP OF THESE COMMITTEES IS COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM; MEMBERSHIP VARIES ACROSS THE COMMITTEES AND IS BASED ON THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMMITTEE. TYPICALLY MEMBERSHIP

INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS, CIO, TREASURY, RISK MANAGEMENT, FINANCE, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE AND OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE COMMITTEES MEET REGULARLY TO DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS, RISK EXPOSURES, AND RISK CONCENTRATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE EFFECTS OF RISK ISSUES ARE CONSIDERED BROADLY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE

OVERSEES SENIOR MANAGEMENT RISK-RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING REVIEWING MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE POLICIES AND RELATED BENCHMARKS. THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWS FIRM LEVEL MARKET RISK LIMITS AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE CROS FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND THE HEADS OF COUNTRY RISK, MARKET RISK, MODEL RISK AND THE WHOLESALE CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER MEET WITH THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE ON A REGULAR BASIS. IN ADDITION, IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS, THE CEO OR CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE OF ANY RESULTS WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO EXCEED LINE OF BUSINESS OR FIRMWIDE RISK APPETITE TOLERANCES. THE CEO OR CRO IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD’S RISK POLICY COMMITTEE IF CERTAIN FIRMWIDE LIMITS ARE MODIFIED OR EXCEEDED.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS THAT IS RELIED UPON TO PROVIDE

124

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, INTERNAL AUDIT, AN INDEPENDENT FUNCTION WITHIN THE FIRM THAT PROVIDES INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATIVELY TO THE CEO. INTERNAL AUDIT CONDUCTS REGULAR INDEPENDENT REVIEWS TO EVALUATE THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORS WITH AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO MANAGE AND CONTROL RISK.

AMONG THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT LEVEL COMMITTEES THAT ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN RISK-RELATED FUNCTIONS ARE.

THE ASSET-LIABILITY COMMITTEE,

CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE TREASURER, MONITORS THE FIRM’S OVERALL INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY RISK. ALCO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POLICY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. ALCO ALSO REVIEWS THE FIRM’S FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING POLICY (THROUGH WHICH LINES OF BUSINESS “TRANSFER” INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK TO TREASURY), NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE-AT-RISK, OVERALL INTEREST RATE POSITION, FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND STRATEGY, AND THE FIRM’S SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS (AND ANY REQUIRED LIQUIDITY SUPPORT BY THE FIRM OF SUCH PROGRAMS).

THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE

IS CO-CHAIRED BY THE FIRM’S CEO AND CRO OR DEPUTY CRO.

THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE

IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRM’S CRO AND DEPUTY CRO. THESE COMMITTEES MEET MONTHLY TO REVIEW CROSS-LINE OF BUSINESS ISSUES SUCH AS RISK APPETITE, CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND AGGREGATE RISK MEASURES, RISK POLICY, RISK METHODOLOGY REGULATORY CAPITAL AND OTHER REGULATORY ISSUES, AS REFERRED BY LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES. THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT LINE OF BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE RISK REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH RISK APPETITE LEVELS ARE MONITORED, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRM’S CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE MEETS AT LEAST ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND IS CO-CHAIRED BY THE LINE OF BUSINESS CRO AND CEO OR EQUIVALENT. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEE IS ALSO ATTENDED BY INDIVIDUALS FROM OUTSIDE THE LINE OF BUSINESS. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES TO ESCALATE LINE OF BUSINESS RISK TOPICS TO THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE AS APPROPRIATE.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, THERE IS THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE

,

CHAIRED BY THE FIRM’S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER THAT MEETS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS AND OVERSEES GLOBAL MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE FIRM’S PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS CRITICAL TO BOTH ITS SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.

•

RISK IDENTIFICATION: THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO RISK THROUGH ITS DAILY BUSINESS DEALINGS, INCLUDING LENDING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONAL SERVICES, IS IDENTIFIED AND AGGREGATED THROUGH THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE ARE NINE MAJOR RISK TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, COUNTRY RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, AND REPUTATION RISK.

•

RISK MEASUREMENT: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING CALCULATING PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS TESTS AND MAKING COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL MODEL REVIEW, EMPIRICAL VALIDATION AND BENCHMARKING WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRM’S RISK ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE RISK OF THE UNDERLYING POSITIONS.

•

RISK MONITORING/CONTROL: THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCORPORATE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INCLUDE APPROVAL LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND BUSINESS. THESE LIMITS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

•

RISK REPORTING: THE FIRM REPORTS RISK EXPOSURES ON BOTH A LINE OF BUSINESS AND A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT ON A DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

MODEL RISK

THE FIRM USES RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS, INCLUDING VALUE-AT-RISK (“VAR”) AND STRESS MODELS, FOR THE MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS. VALUATION MODELS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM TO VALUE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH CANNOT OTHERWISE BE VALUED USING QUOTED PRICES. THESE VALUATION MODELS MAY ALSO BE EMPLOYED AS INPUTS TO RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS, FOR EXAMPLE IN VAR AND ECONOMIC STRESS MODELS. THE FIRM ALSO MAKES USE OF MODELS FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE CALCULATION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

MODELS ARE OWNED BY VARIOUS FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE FIRM BASED ON THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF SUCH MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, VAR MODELS AND CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS ARE OWNED BY THE LINE-OF-BUSINESS ALIGNED RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. OWNERS OF THE MODELS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING OF MODELS, AS WELL AS REFERRAL OF MODELS TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION (WITHIN THE MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT) FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. ONCE MODELS HAVE BEEN APPROVED, THE MODEL OWNERS MAINTAIN A ROBUST OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF MODELS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MODEL OWNERS ENHANCE MODELS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

125

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE PORTFOLIOS AND FOR CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN AVAILABLE MODELING TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, AND SUBMIT SUCH ENHANCEMENTS TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION FOR REVIEW.

THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION COMPRISES THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP AND THE MODEL GOVERNANCE GROUP AND REPORTS TO THE MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT, WHICH IN TURN REPORTS TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MODEL OWNERS AND REVIEWS AND APPROVES A WIDE RANGE OF MODELS, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT, VALUATION AND CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL MODELS USED BY THE FIRM.

MODELS ARE TIERED BASED ON AN INTERNAL STANDARD ACCORDING TO THEIR COMPLEXITY, THE EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODEL AND THE FIRM’S RELIANCE ON THE MODEL. THIS TIERING IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODEL’S SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION OR RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THE FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE ASSIGNED MODEL TIER, WHETHER THE MODEL ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SELECTION AND RELIABILITY OF MODEL INPUTS, CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY MODEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED FROM THE MARKET. WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES. MODEL REVIEWS ARE APPROVED BY THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION BASED ON THE RELEVANT TIER OF THE MODEL.

UNDER THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY, NEW SIGNIFICANT MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION PERFORMS AN ANNUAL FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK ASSESSMENT WHERE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER MODELS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED AGAIN.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION DOES NOT APPROVE A SIGNIFICANT MODEL, ESCALATION TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED AND THE MODEL OWNER IS REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE THE MODEL WITHIN A TIME PERIOD AS AGREED UPON WITH THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION. THE MODEL OWNER IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RESUBMIT THE MODEL FOR REVIEW TO THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE MODEL RISK IN THE INTERIM. THE ACTIONS TAKEN WILL DEPEND ON THE MODEL THAT IS DISAPPROVED AND MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, LIMITATION OF TRADING ACTIVITY. THE FIRM MAY ALSO IMPLEMENT OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MEASUREMENT TOOLS IN PLACE TO AUGMENT THE MODEL THAT IS SUBJECT TO REMEDIATION.

EXCEPTIONS TO THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY MAY BE GRANTED BY THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION TO ALLOW A SIGNIFICANT MODEL TO BE USED PRIOR TO REVIEW OR APPROVAL. SUCH EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WHERE THIS IS THE CASE, COMPENSATING CONTROLS SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT, COMPOSITION AND TENOR OF FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY IN SUPPORT OF ITS ASSETS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ARE TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM’S CORE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF CLIENT NEEDS AND MEET CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS THROUGH NORMAL ECONOMIC CYCLES AS WELL AS DURING MARKET STRESS AND MAINTAIN DEBT RATINGS THAT ENABLE THE FIRM TO OPTIMIZE ITS FUNDING MIX AND LIQUIDITY SOURCES WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS.

THE FIRM MANAGES LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING USING A CENTRALIZED, GLOBAL APPROACH IN ORDER TO ACTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM AS A WHOLE, MONITOR EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY CONSTRAINTS ON THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDITY WITHIN THE FIRM, AND MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS LIQUIDITY AS PART OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

MEASURING, MANAGING, MONITORING AND REPORTING THE FIRM’S CURRENT AND PROJECTED LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND USES;

•

UNDERSTANDING THE LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES;

•

DEFINING AND MONITORING FIRMWIDE AND LEGAL ENTITY LIQUIDITY STRATEGIES, POLICIES, GUIDELINES, AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLANS;

•

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING UNDER A VARIETY OF ADVERSE SCENARIOS

•

MANAGING FUNDING MIX AND DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS SHORT-TERM CASH;

•

DEFINING AND IMPLEMENTING FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING (“FTP”) ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND REGIONS; AND

•

DEFINING AND ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY CHANGES ON FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY.

THE FIRM HAS A LIQUIDITY RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK TO REVIEW, APPROVE AND MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LIQUIDITY RISK POLICIES AND FUNDING AND CAPITAL STRATEGIES AT THE FIRMWIDE, REGIONAL AND LINE OF BUSINESS LEVELS.

SPECIFIC RISK COMMITTEES RESPONSIBLE FOR LIQUIDITY RISK GOVERNANCE INCLUDE ALCO AS WELL AS LINES OF BUSINESS AND REGIONAL ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RISK COMMITTEES, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

123–126

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POSITION TO BE STRONG AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND BELIEVES THAT THE FIRM’S UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING CAPACITY IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS.

LCR AND NSFR

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE BASEL COMMITTEE INTRODUCED TWO NEW MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK: THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (“LCR”) WHICH IS INTENDED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF “HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS” HELD BY THE FIRM DURING AN ACUTE STRESS, IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATED NET CASH OUTFLOWS WITHIN THE 30-DAY PERIOD; AND THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO

(“NSFR”) WHICH IS INTENDED TO MEASURE THE “AVAILABLE” AMOUNT OF STABLE FUNDING RELATIVE TO THE “REQUIRED” AMOUNT OF STABLE FUNDING OVER A 1-YEAR HORIZON. THE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT THE LCR BE NO LOWER THAN 100% AND THE NSFR BE GREATER THAN 100%.

IN JANUARY 2013, THE BASEL COMMITTEE INTRODUCED CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE FORMULATION OF THE LCR, AND A REVISED TIMETABLE TO PHASE-IN THE STANDARD. THE LCR WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, BUT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WILL BEGIN AT 60%, INCREASING IN EQUAL ANNUAL STAGES TO REACH 100% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY TARGETING TO ATTAIN A 100% LCR, BASED ON ITS CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENTS, BY THE END OF 2013. THE NSFR IS SCHEDULED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN 2018.

FUNDING

THE FIRM FUNDS ITS GLOBAL BALANCE SHEET THROUGH DIVERSE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING A STABLE DEPOSIT FRANCHISE AS WELL AS SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. ACCESS TO FUNDING MARKETS IS EXECUTED REGIONALLY THROUGH HUBS IN NEW YORK, LONDON, HONG KONG AND OTHER LOCATIONS WHICH ENABLES THE FIRM TO OBSERVE AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM MANAGES AND MONITORS ITS USE OF WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS TO MAXIMIZE MARKET ACCESS, OPTIMIZE FUNDING COST AND ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS FUNDING PROFILE ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, TENORS, CURRENCIES, PRODUCT TYPES AND COUNTERPARTIES, USING KEY METRICS INCLUDING SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES, AND IN RELATION TO HIGH-QUALITY ASSETS, AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.

SOURCES OF FUNDS

A KEY STRENGTH OF THE FIRM IS ITS DIVERSIFIED DEPOSIT FRANCHISE, THROUGH EACH OF ITS LINES OF BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING AND LIMITS RELIANCE ON THE WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FIRM’S DEPOSITS-TO-LOANS RATIO WAS

163%

, COMPARED WITH

156%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE

$1,193.6 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$1,127.8 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 (

55%

AND

54%

OF TOTAL LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY). THE INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO GROWTH IN RETAIL AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES

AND

35%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY), WHICH ARE CONSIDERED PARTICULARLY STABLE AS THEY ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES OR MARKET VOLATILITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S INSTITUTIONAL DEPOSITS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE STABLE SOURCES OF FUNDING SINCE THEY ARE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT MAINTAIN OPERATING SERVICE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FIRM.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING

SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS AND EURODOLLARS PURCHASED; CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT; TIME DEPOSITS; COMMERCIAL PAPER; AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS THAT GENERALLY HAVE MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR OR LESS.

THE FIRM’S RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING SOURCES IS LIMITED. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES, APPROXIMATELY

72%

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW, WERE ORIGINATED FROM DEPOSITS THAT CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO SWEEP INTO COMMERCIAL PAPER LIABILITIES AS A CASH MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM OFFERED BY CIB AND ARE NOT SOURCED FROM WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS.

THE FIRM’S SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED FUNDING PRIMARILY CONSIST OF SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE. SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE GENERALLY MATURE BETWEEN ONE DAY AND THREE MONTHS, ARE SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES COLLATERAL, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT-ISSUED DEBT, AGENCY DEBT AND AGENCY MBS, AND CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN THE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, COMPARED WITH THE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER SECURED FINANCING OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS. THE BALANCES ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE FLUCTUATE OVER TIME DUE TO CUSTOMERS’ INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES; THE FIRM’S DEMAND FOR FINANCING; THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THE MIX OF THE FIRM’S LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ITS SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING (FOR BOTH THE INVESTMENT AND MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS); AND OTHER MARKET AND PORTFOLIO FACTORS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE BALANCE OF TOTAL UNSECURED AND SECURED OTHER BORROWED FUNDS INCREASED, COMPARED WITH THE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TERM FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND IN CIB STRUCTURED NOTES. THE AVERAGE BALANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY MATURITIES OF SHORT-TERM UNSECURED BANK NOTES AND OTHER UNSECURED BORROWINGS, AND OTHER SECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.

FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S ANNOUNCEMENT ON JUNE 7, 2012, OF PROPOSED RULES WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT THE PHASE-OUT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 11, 2012, THAT IT WOULD REDEEM APPROXIMATELY $9.0 BILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES PURSUANT TO REDEMPTION PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE OCCURRENCE OF A “CAPITAL TREATMENT EVENT” (AS DEFINED IN THE DOCUMENTS GOVERNING THOSE SECURITIES). THE REDEMPTION WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 12, 2012.

THE FIRM RAISES SECURED LONG-TERM FUNDING THROUGH SECURITIZATION OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD LOANS, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AUTO LOANS AND STUDENT LOANS, AS WELL AS THROUGH ADVANCES FROM THE FHLBS, ALL OF WHICH INCREASE FUNDING AND INVESTOR DIVERSITY.

PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY FUNDING

THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY ACTS AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THEREFORE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY IS MAINTAINED AT LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IN A STRESS ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACCESS TO NORMAL FUNDING SOURCES IS DISRUPTED.

TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR THE ADEQUACY OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING AT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY, THE FIRM USES THREE PRIMARY MEASURES.

•

NUMBER OF MONTHS OF PRE-FUNDING: THE FIRM TARGETS PRE-FUNDING OF THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT BOTH CONTRACTUAL AND NON-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS CAN BE MET FOR AT LEAST 18 MONTHS ASSUMING NO ACCESS TO WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS. HOWEVER, DUE TO CONSERVATIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM, THE CURRENT PRE-FUNDING OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS IS GREATER THAN TARGET.

•

EXCESS CASH: EXCESS CASH IS MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT DAILY CASH REQUIREMENTS CAN BE MET IN BOTH NORMAL AND STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS. EXCESS CASH GENERATED BY PARENT HOLDING COMPANY ISSUANCE ACTIVITY IS PLACED ON DEPOSIT WITH OR AS ADVANCES TO BOTH BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OR HELD AS LIQUID COLLATERAL PURCHASED THROUGH REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

•

STRESS TESTING: THE FIRM CONDUCTS REGULAR STRESS TESTING FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND MAJOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL U.S. AND U.K. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM’S

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

129

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ITS SUBSIDIARIES’ ABILITY TO GENERATE REPLACEMENT FUNDING IN THE EVENT THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DEPOSITS AND ADVANCES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE STRESS TESTING DISCUSSION BELOW.

GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE

THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE INCLUDES CASH ON DEPOSIT AT CENTRAL BANKS, AND CASH PROCEEDS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN SECURED FINANCINGS OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES (SUCH AS SOVEREIGN DEBT, GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED CORPORATE DEBT, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY DEBT, AND AGENCY MBS) THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THE LIQUIDITY AMOUNT ESTIMATED TO BE REALIZED FROM SECURED FINANCINGS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT JUDGMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO QUICKLY RAISE FUNDS FROM SECURED FINANCINGS.

THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE ALSO INCLUDES THE FIRM’S BORROWING CAPACITY AT VARIOUS FHLBS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A RESULT OF COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY THE FIRM TO SUCH BANKS. ALTHOUGH CONSIDERED AS A SOURCE OF AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW AND VARIOUS OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $491 BILLION, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $379 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE FLUCTUATES DUE TO CHANGES IN DEPOSITS, THE FIRM’S PURCHASE AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY RESERVE, THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES SUCH AS CORPORATE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE TO RAISE LIQUIDITY, IF REQUIRED.

STRESS TESTING

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM UNDER A VARIETY OF ADVERSE SCENARIOS. RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED IN THE FORMULATION OF THE FIRM’S FUNDING PLAN AND ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION. LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS ARE

MODELED ACROSS A RANGE OF TIME HORIZONS AND VARYING DEGREES OF MARKET AND IDIOSYNCRATIC STRESS. STANDARD STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AD HOC STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED AS REQUIRED. STRESS SCENARIOS ARE PRODUCED FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FIRM’S MAJOR BANK SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S PRINCIPAL U.S. AND U.K. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, SEPARATE REGIONAL LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING IS PERFORMED.

LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTS ASSUME ALL OF THE FIRM’S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MET AND ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARYING LEVELS OF ACCESS TO UNSECURED AND SECURED FUNDING MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO POTENTIAL NON-CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.

•

DEPOSITS

◦

FOR BANK DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY, THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL OUTFLOWS REFLECT THE TYPE AND SIZE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT, AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRM’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.

•

SECURED FUNDING

◦

RANGE OF HAIRCUTS ON COLLATERAL BASED ON SECURITY TYPE AND COUNTERPARTY.

•

DERIVATIVES

◦

MARGIN CALLS BY EXCHANGES OR CLEARING HOUSES;

◦

COLLATERAL CALLS ASSOCIATED WITH RATINGS DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS AND VARIATION MARGIN;

◦

OUTFLOWS OF EXCESS CLIENT COLLATERAL;

◦

NOVATION OF DERIVATIVE TRADES.

•

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS

◦

POTENTIAL FACILITY DRAWDOWNS REFLECTING THE TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.

CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

THE FIRM’S CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN (“CFP”), WHICH IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY ALCO, PROVIDES A DOCUMENTED FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING BOTH TEMPORARY AND LONGER-TERM UNEXPECTED ADVERSE LIQUIDITY SITUATIONS. IT SETS OUT A LIST OF INDICATORS AND METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON A DAILY BASIS TO IDENTIFY THE EMERGENCE OF INCREASED RISKS OR VULNERABILITIES IN THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE CFP IDENTIFIES ALTERNATIVE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY RESOURCES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED UNDER ADVERSE LIQUIDITY CIRCUMSTANCES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT RATINGS

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. REDUCTIONS IN THESE RATINGS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO THE FIRM.

ON JUNE 21, 2012, MOODY’S DOWNGRADED THE LONG-TERM RATINGS OF THE FIRM AND AFFIRMED ALL ITS SHORT-TERM RATINGS. THE OUTLOOK FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY WAS LEFT ON NEGATIVE REFLECTING MOODY’S VIEW THAT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANY CREDITORS IS BECOMING LESS CERTAIN AND LESS PREDICTABLE. SUCH RATINGS ACTIONS CONCLUDED MOODY’S REVIEW OF 17 BANKS AND SECURITIES FIRMS WITH GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, AS A RESULT OF WHICH ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE DOWNGRADED BY VARIOUS DEGREES.

FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY THE FIRM, ON MAY 10, 2012, OF LOSSES FROM THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO HELD BY CIO, FITCH DOWNGRADED THE FIRM AND PLACED ALL PARENT AND SUBSIDIARY LONG-TERM RATINGS ON RATINGS WATCH NEGATIVE. AT THAT TIME, S&P ALSO REVISED ITS OUTLOOK ON THE RATINGS OF THE FIRM FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON OCTOBER 10, 2012, FITCH REVISED THE OUTLOOK TO STABLE AND AFFIRMED THE FIRM’S RATINGS.

THE ABOVE-MENTIONED RATING ACTIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S COST OF FUNDS AND ITS ABILITY TO FUND ITSELF. FURTHER DOWNGRADES OF THE FIRM’S LONG-TERM RATINGS BY ONE NOTCH OR TWO NOTCHES COULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE OF THE FIRM’S SHORT-TERM RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS COST OF FUNDS COULD INCREASE AND ACCESS TO CERTAIN FUNDING MARKETS COULD BE REDUCED. THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OF FURTHER RATINGS DOWNGRADES DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS CONTRACTUAL AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS (WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES ARE INCORPORATED IN THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY RISK AND STRESS TESTING METRICS). THE FIRM BELIEVES IT MAINTAINS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO WITHSTAND ANY POTENTIAL DECREASE IN FUNDING CAPACITY DUE TO FURTHER RATINGS DOWNGRADES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNSECURED DEBT DOES NOT CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD CALL FOR AN ACCELERATION OF PAYMENTS, MATURITIES OR CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXISTING DEBT, PROVIDE ANY LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE BORROWINGS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, BASED ON UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, OR STOCK PRICE.

RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE VARIOUS RATINGS FACTORS, SUCH AS REGULATORY REFORMS, RATING UPLIFT ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND SOVEREIGN CREDITWORTHINESS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON RATINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND ENDEAVORS TO MANAGE FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS CREDIT RATINGS WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CASH FLOWS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS DECREASED

$5.9 BILLION

, AND INCREASED BY

$32.0 BILLION

AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT AFFECTED JPMORGAN CHASE’S CASH FLOWS DURING

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUPPORT THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MARKETS AND LENDING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE ORIGINATION OR PURCHASE OF LOANS INITIALLY DESIGNATED AS HELD-FOR-SALE. OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY CLIENT-DRIVEN AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH THROUGH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE FIRM’S OPERATING LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$25.1 BILLION

. THIS RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED REFLECTING A SHIFT IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF EXCESS CASH TO RESALE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY IN CIB, AND LOWER TRADING ASSETS - DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND TIGHTENING OF CREDIT SPREADS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WAS A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO LOWER CIB CLIENT BALANCES, AND AN INCREASE IN TRADING ASSETS - DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB. NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCASH ITEMS SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. CASH USED TO ACQUIRE LOANS WAS HIGHER THAN CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF SUCH LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL, AND ALSO REFLECTED A LOWER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY OVER THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $95.9 BILLION. THIS RESULTED FROM A NET DECREASE IN TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES – DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, DRIVEN BY CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY IN CIB; AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER CIB CLIENT BALANCES, AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY IN CIB, DRIVEN BY A LARGE REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER MARGIN RECEIVABLES DUE TO CHANGES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WAS AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES BORROWED, PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE DUE TO HIGHER EXCESS CASH POSITIONS AT YEAR-END. NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME LARGELY AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCASH ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROVIDED BY PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF

LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WAS HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS, AND ALSO REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY OVER THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.8 BILLION, MAINLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE PRIMARILY IN TRADING ASSETS – DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS; PRINCIPALLY DUE TO IMPROVED MARKET ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IN EQUITY SECURITIES, FOREIGN DEBT AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TRADING LIABILITIES DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF POSITIONS TAKEN TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER-DRIVEN ACTIVITY. NET CASH WAS PROVIDED BY NET INCOME AND FROM ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS SUCH AS THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. ADDITIONALLY, PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED WITH AN INITIAL INTENT TO SELL WERE HIGHER THAN CASH USED TO ACQUIRE SUCH LOANS.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S INVESTING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE LOANS ORIGINATED TO BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT, THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, NET CASH OF

$119.8 BILLION

WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS DUE TO DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH BY TREASURY; HIGHER DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING PLACEMENTS OF THE FIRM’S EXCESS CASH WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, PRIMARILY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS; AND HIGHER LEVELS OF WHOLESALE LOANS, PRIMARILY IN CB AND AM, DRIVEN BY HIGHER WHOLESALE ACTIVITY ACROSS MOST OF THE FIRM’S REGIONS AND BUSINESSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE A DECLINE IN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOANS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO MORTGAGE-RELATED PAYDOWNS AND PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF, AND A DECLINE IN CREDIT CARD LOANS DUE TO HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES; AND PROCEEDS FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF AFS SECURITIES, WHICH WERE HIGHER THAN THE CASH USED TO ACQUIRE NEW AFS SECURITIES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH OF $170.8 BILLION WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS REFLECTING THE PLACEMENT OF FUNDS WITH VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS, PREDOMINANTLY RESULTING FROM THE OVERALL GROWTH IN WHOLESALE CLIENT DEPOSITS; AN INCREASE IN LOANS REFLECTING CONTINUED GROWTH IN CLIENT ACTIVITY ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES AND REGIONS; NET PURCHASES OF AFS SECURITIES, LARGELY DUE TO REPOSITIONING OF THE PORTFOLIO IN CORPORATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT; AND AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE DUE TO HIGHER EXCESS CASH POSITIONS AT YEAR-END. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE A DECLINE IN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOAN BALANCES DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF, AND IN CREDIT CARD LOANS, DUE TO HIGHER REPAYMENT RATES, RUN-OFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO AND THE FIRM’S SALE OF THE KOHL’S PORTFOLIO.

132

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, NET CASH OF $54.0 BILLION WAS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THIS RESULTED FROM A DECREASE IN DEPOSITS WITH BANKS LARGELY DUE TO A DECLINE IN DEPOSITS PLACED WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND LOWER INTERBANK LENDING AS MARKET STRESS EASED SINCE THE END OF 2009; NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF AFS SECURITIES USED IN THE FIRM’S INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN CORPORATE; AND A NET DECREASE IN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO, DRIVEN BY THE EXPECTED RUNOFF OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL PORTFOLIO, A DECLINE IN LOWER-YIELDING PROMOTIONAL CREDIT CARD BALANCES, CONTINUED RUNOFF OF LOAN BALANCES IN THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, AND REPAYMENTS AND LOAN SALES IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY IN CIB AND CB; THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ORIGINATIONS ACROSS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER BUSINESSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH PROCEEDS WAS AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO HIGHER FINANCING VOLUME IN CIB; AND CASH USED FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY RBS SEMPRA.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE FIRM’S FINANCING ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY INCLUDE TAKING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, AND ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT AS WELL AS PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS

$87.7 BILLION

. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS; AN INCREASE IN DEPOSITS DUE TO GROWTH IN BOTH CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES

106–108

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DUE TO HIGHER SECURED FINANCINGS OF THE FIRM’S ASSETS; AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE IN THE WHOLESALE FUNDING MARKETS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF CLIENT DEPOSITS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY BALANCES RELATED TO CIB’S LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PRODUCT; AN INCREASE IN OTHER BORROWED FUNDS DUE TO HIGHER SECURED AND UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING NEEDS; AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING TRUPS, AND SECURITIZED CREDIT CARDS; AND PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $107.7 BILLION. THIS WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEPOSITS, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO AN OVERALL GROWTH IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CONSUMER DEPOSIT BALANCES. THE INCREASE IN WHOLESALE CLIENT BALANCES, PARTICULARLY IN CIB AND CB, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER RETURNS ON OTHER AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS AND LOW INTEREST RATES DURING 2011, AND IN AM, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS AND LEVEL OF DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER DUE TO GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF LIABILITY BALANCES IN SWEEP ACCOUNTS RELATED TO CIB’S CASH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. CASH WAS USED TO REDUCE SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, PREDOMINANTLY IN CIB, REFLECTING THE LOWER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRM BASED ON LOWER TRADING INVENTORY LEVELS, AND CHANGE IN THE MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES; FOR NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING A DECREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO NET REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN LONG-TERM BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES DUE TO MATURITIES OF FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS; TO REDUCE OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY MATURITIES OF SHORT-TERM SECURED BORROWINGS, UNSECURED BANK NOTES AND SHORT-TERM FHLB ADVANCES; AND FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS, AND PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK.

IN 2010, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $49.2 BILLION. THIS RESULTED FROM NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS NEW ISSUANCES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY PAYMENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECLINE IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES DUE TO MATURITIES RELATED TO FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; A DECLINE IN DEPOSITS ASSOCIATED WITH WHOLESALE FUNDING ACTIVITIES DUE TO THE FIRM’S LOWER FUNDING NEEDS; LOWER DEPOSIT LEVELS IN CIB, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NET INFLOWS FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS IN AM, CB AND CCB; A DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER BORROWED FUNDS DUE TO LOWER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS; PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS; AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK. CASH WAS GENERATED AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS LARGELY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY LEVELS IN CIB PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CORPORATE REFLECTING REPOSITIONING ACTIVITIES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. IN ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARD, AUTO, BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LENDING BUSINESSES, WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS OF SERVING THE PRIME SEGMENT OF THE CONSUMER MARKET. ORIGINATED MORTGAGE LOANS ARE RETAINED IN THE MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, OR SECURITIZED OR SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES; OTHER TYPES OF CONSUMER LOANS ARE TYPICALLY RETAINED ON BALANCE SHEET. IN ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS UNDERWRITING, LENDING AND DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES WITH AND FOR CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH ITS OPERATING SERVICES ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES. LOANS ORIGINATED OR ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE FIRM’S SYNDICATED LOAN BUSINESS, DISTRIBUTES A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ORIGINATIONS INTO THE MARKET AND IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

MONITORING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LINE APPROVAL

•

ASSIGNING AND MANAGING CREDIT AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE

•

MANAGING CRITICIZED EXPOSURES AND DELINQUENT LOANS

•

DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH ITS LENDING, CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES AND OPERATING SERVICES BUSINESSES. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURES ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS. TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING CREDIT RISK VARY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER VERSUS WHOLESALE), RISK MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK-RATING) AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE

PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO AND RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THESE LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED USING STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK CAPITAL AND REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE METHODOLOGIES USED TO MEASURE PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES DEPENDS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CREDIT EXPOSURE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

SCORED EXPOSURE

THE SCORED PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY HELD IN CCB AND INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, CREDIT CARD LOANS, CERTAIN AUTO AND BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, AND STUDENT LOANS. FOR THE SCORED PORTFOLIO, PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ARE BASED ON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO ARE ESTIMATED USING PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING, AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS, WHICH CONSIDER LOAN-LEVEL FACTORS SUCH AS DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT SCORES, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. ESTIMATED PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ALSO CONSIDER UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. THE FACTORS AND ANALYSIS ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY AS MARKET CONDITIONS DICTATE.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE GENERALLY HELD IN CIB, CB AND AM, BUT ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO DEALER LOANS HELD IN CCB THAT ARE RISK-RATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL LOANS. FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIO, PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT. THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BEGINS WITH RISK-RATINGS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH LOAN FACILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. THESE RISK-RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE BORROWER’S CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION, RISK PROFILE AND RELATED COLLATERAL. THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL DEFAULT AND NOT BE FULLY REPAID BY THE BORROWER. THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS ESTIMATED FOR EACH BORROWER, AND A LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT IS ESTIMATED CONSIDERING THE COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THE CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT

134

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW.

STRESS TESTING

STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND MANAGING CREDIT RISK IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE PROCESS ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS SCENARIOS ON ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE FIRM. ECONOMIC SCENARIOS, AND THE PARAMETERS UNDERLYING THOSE SCENARIOS, ARE DEFINED CENTRALLY AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE BUSINESSES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE ARTICULATED IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO CREDIT MIGRATION, CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND POTENTIAL LOSSES IN THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION TO THE PERIODIC STRESS TESTING PROCESSES, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERS ADDITIONAL STRESSES OUTSIDE THESE SCENARIOS, AS NECESSARY.

RISK MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE APPROVAL AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT AND TO ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ASSESSED ACCURATELY, APPROVED PROPERLY, MONITORED REGULARLY AND MANAGED ACTIVELY AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES, PORTFOLIO REVIEW PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF DISTRESSED EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN MODELS, ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN EVALUATING AND MONITORING CREDIT RISK ARE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATED BY GROUPS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE LINE OF BUSINESSES.

FOR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS, INCLUDING ANY CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, ARE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, AS CERTAIN OF THESE TRENDS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. CONSUMER RISK MANAGEMENT EVALUATES DELINQUENCY AND OTHER TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS, CURRENT AND FORECASTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. LOSS MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE BEING EMPLOYED FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM OR PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DEFERRAL AND OTHER ACTIONS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE ECONOMIC LOSS AND AVOID FORECLOSURE. HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED TRENDS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE MODELING OF ESTIMATED CONSUMER CREDIT LOSSES AND ARE PART OF THE MONITORING OF THE CREDIT RISK PROFILE OF THE PORTFOLIO. UNDER THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK POLICY, NEW SIGNIFICANT RISK MANAGEMENT MODELS, AS WELL AS MAJOR CHANGES TO SUCH MODELS, ARE REQUIRED TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. INTERNAL AUDIT ALSO PERIODICALLY TESTS THE INTERNAL CONTROLS AROUND THE MODELING PROCESS INCLUDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA UTILIZED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CONSUMER LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED REGULARLY AT AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO, INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY BASIS WITH ESTABLISHED CONCENTRATION LIMITS THAT ARE REVIEWED AND REVISED, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT, TYPICALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. INDUSTRY AND COUNTERPARTY LIMITS, AS MEASURED IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE AND ECONOMIC CREDIT RISK CAPITAL, ARE SUBJECT TO STRESS-BASED LOSS CONSTRAINTS.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MEANS INCLUDING.

•

LOAN UNDERWRITING AND CREDIT APPROVAL PROCESS

•

LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS

•

LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

•

USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS

•

COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES

IN ADDITION TO RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMS, AS WELL AS CONTINUOUS REVIEW, WHERE APPROPRIATE, OF THE FIRM’S CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PORTFOLIOS. FOR RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, A CREDIT REVIEW GROUP WITHIN INTERNAL AUDIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

•

INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING THE CHANGING RISK GRADES ASSIGNED TO EXPOSURES; AND

•

EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BUSINESS UNITS’ RISK-RATINGS, INCLUDING THE ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY OF RISK GRADES, THE TIMELINESS OF RISK GRADE CHANGES AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF RISK GRADES IN CREDIT MEMORANDA

RISK REPORTING

TO ENABLE MONITORING OF CREDIT RISK AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING, AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE, CREDIT QUALITY FORECASTS, CONCENTRATION LEVELS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

2012

CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

THE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT IN

2012

CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, BUT CONCERNS PERSISTED AROUND THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE U.S. FISCAL SITUATION. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS UNDERPERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS AND REDUCE SUCH EXPOSURES THROUGH REPAYMENTS, LOAN SALES AND WORKOUTS. THE FIRM SAW DECREASED DOWNGRADE, DEFAULT AND CHARGE-OFF ACTIVITY AND IMPROVED CONSUMER DELINQUENCY TRENDS. THE FIRM DID SEE A MINIMAL INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS A RESULT OF SUPERSTORM SANDY BUT CURRENTLY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE LOSSES TO BE MATERIAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THE FIRM INCREASED ITS OVERALL LENDING ACTIVITY DRIVEN BY THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPARED WITH

2011

AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRM’S REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF REGULATORY GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTED DURING 2012 WHICH RESULTED IN THE FIRM REPORTING AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF NONACCRUAL LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

(SEE PAGE

146

IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION).

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE REPORTING CHANGES NOTED ABOVE, NONPERFORMING LOANS WOULD HAVE DECREASED FROM

2011.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE PRODUCT SPECTRUM HAS IMPROVED, WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DELINQUENT LOANS AND CHARGE-OFFS. WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF REAL ESTATE LOANS CHARGED OFF, WHILE CONTINUED WEAK HOUSING PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN AN ELEVATED SEVERITY OF LOSS RECOGNIZED ON THESE DEFAULTED LOANS. THE FIRM HAS TAKEN PROACTIVE STEPS TO ASSIST HOMEOWNERS MOST IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AND CONSUMER LOANS, SEE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

138–149

AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE WHOLESALE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT REMAINED FAVORABLE THROUGHOUT

2012

. THE RISE IN COMMERCIAL CLIENT ACTIVITY RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN CREDIT EXPOSURE ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, REGIONS AND PRODUCTS. UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF LENDING CONTINUE TO REMAIN A KEY POINT OF FOCUS, CONSISTENT WITH EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO BE ACTIVELY MANAGED, IN PART BY CONDUCTING ONGOING, IN-DEPTH REVIEWS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND OF INDUSTRY, PRODUCT AND CLIENT CONCENTRATIONS. DURING THE YEAR, WHOLESALE

CRITICIZED ASSETS, NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED FROM THE HIGHER LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN

2011

, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN NONACCRUAL LOANS BY 40%. AS A RESULT, THE RATIO OF NONACCRUAL LOANS TO TOTAL LOANS, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS COVERAGE RATIO ALL DECLINED. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF WHOLESALE LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, CREDIT CARD LOANS, AUTO LOANS, BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, AND STUDENT LOANS. THE FIRM’S PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON SERVING THE PRIME SEGMENT OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON CONSUMER LOANS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CONSUMER LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE IDENTIFIED AS PCI BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RISK CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TYPE, LOAN-TO-VALUE (“LTV”) RATIOS, FICO RISK SCORES AND DELINQUENCY STATUS. THESE PCI LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A POOL BASIS, AND THE POOLS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFORMING. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON PCI LOANS SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IMPROVED AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUED TO SLOWLY EXPAND DURING

2012

, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES, PARTICULARLY IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. HOWEVER, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RELATIVE TO THE HISTORICAL NORM AND WEAK HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS BEING CHARGED OFF AND THE SEVERITY OF LOSS RECOGNIZED ON THESE LOANS. EARLY-STAGE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DELINQUENCIES (30–89 DAYS DELINQUENT), EXCLUDING GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED LOANS, DECLINED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, BUT INCREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO SEASONAL IMPACTS AND THE EFFECT OF SUPERSTORM SANDY. LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (150+ DAYS DELINQUENT) CONTINUED TO DECLINE, BUT REMAIN ELEVATED. THE ELEVATED LEVEL OF THE LATE-STAGE DELINQUENT LOANS IS DUE, IN PART, TO LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN AND TO ELONGATED FORECLOSURE PROCESSING TIMELINES. LOSSES RELATED TO THESE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S STANDARD CHARGE-OFF PRACTICES, BUT SOME DELINQUENT LOANS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED UPON REMAIN IN THE MORTGAGE AND HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIOS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ELEVATED LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND WEAK HOUSING PRICES, UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS, AND THE RISK ATTRIBUTES OF CERTAIN LOANS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO (E.G., LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS, JUNIOR LIEN LOANS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO A DELINQUENT OR MODIFIED SENIOR LIEN) CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING OVERALL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM REPORTED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE,

$1.7 BILLION

OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND AUTO LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY AND NOT REAFFIRMED BY THE BORROWER (“CHAPTER 7 LOANS”) AS COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT NONACCRUAL TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (“TDRS”), REGARDLESS OF THEIR DELINQUENCY STATUS. PURSUANT TO THAT GUIDANCE, THESE CHAPTER 7 LOANS WERE CHARGED OFF TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, RESULTING IN

$800 MILLION

OF CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO RECOVER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THESE LOSSES OVER TIME AS PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, THE FIRM’S POLICY WAS TO CHARGE DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY WHEN SUCH LOANS BECAME 60 DAYS PAST DUE, AND REPORT SUCH LOANS AS NONACCRUAL AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORT LOANS DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY AS TDRS UNLESS OTHERWISE MODIFIED UNDER ONE OF THE FIRM’S LOSS MITIGATION PROGRAMS. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED FOR THIS POLICY CHANGE.

BASED UPON REGULATORY GUIDANCE, THE FIRM ALSO BEGAN REPORTING PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AS NONACCRUAL LOANS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. THE PRIOR YEAR WAS ALSO NOT RESTATED FOR THIS POLICY CHANGE. THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN OF THESE HIGHER-RISK JUNIOR LIEN LOANS AS NONACCRUAL DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AS THE FIRM HAD PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS PORTFOLIO IN ESTIMATING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THIS REGULATORY POLICY CHANGE HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, BECAUSE PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE RECLASSIFIED JUNIOR LIEN LOANS ARE CURRENTLY MAKING PAYMENTS, AND IT IS THE FIRM’S POLICY TO RECOGNIZE THESE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED AS INTEREST INCOME.

PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS

CONSUMER LOAN BALANCES DECLINED DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS. CREDIT PERFORMANCE HAS IMPROVED ACROSS MOST PORTFOLIOS BUT RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE CHARGE-OFFS AND DELINQUENT LOANS REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES. PCI LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXCLUDED FROM INDIVIDUAL LOAN PRODUCT DISCUSSIONS AND ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY BELOW.

HOME EQUITY.

HOME EQUITY LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WERE

$67.4 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$77.8 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011

. THE DECREASE IN THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOAN PAYDOWNS AND CHARGE-OFFS. EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, FOR BOTH SENIOR AND JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS, WHILE NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WHICH INCLUDE CHAPTER 7 LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. SENIOR LIEN AND JUNIOR LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS INCREASED

$890 MILLION

IN 2012 DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS. JUNIOR LIEN NONACCRUAL LOANS ALSO INCREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, DUE TO THE ADDITION OF

$1.2 BILLION

OF PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE BASED UPON REGULATORY GUIDANCE ISSUED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

APPROXIMATELY

20%

OF THE FIRM’S HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LOANS (“HELOANS”) AND THE REMAINDER CONSISTS OF HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (“HELOCS”). HELOANS ARE GENERALLY FIXED-RATE, CLOSED-END, AMORTIZING LOANS, WITH TERMS RANGING FROM 3–30 YEARS. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE HELOANS ARE SENIOR LIENS AND THE REMAINDER ARE JUNIOR LIENS. IN GENERAL, HELOCS ORIGINATED BY THE FIRM ARE REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC RECASTS INTO A LOAN WITH A 20-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD. AT THE TIME OF ORIGINATION, THE BORROWER TYPICALLY SELECTS ONE OF TWO MINIMUM PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN EFFECT DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD: A MONTHLY PAYMENT OF 1% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE, OR INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS BASED ON A VARIABLE INDEX (TYPICALLY PRIME). HELOCS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL WERE GENERALLY REVOLVING LOANS FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC CONVERTS TO AN INTEREST-ONLY LOAN WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE END OF THE LOAN’S TERM. PREDOMINANTLY ALL HELOCS IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO BEYOND THE REVOLVING PERIOD HAVE BEEN MODIFIED INTO FIXED-RATE AMORTIZING LOANS.

THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

140

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

DIFFICULTY OR WHEN THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOAN AMOUNT. THE MAJORITY OF THE HELOCS CONTAIN TERMS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT UNTIL 2015 OR LATER. CERTAIN FACTORS, SUCH AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOME PRICES, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE LOANS. THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE BOTH THE NEAR-TERM AND LONGER-TERM REPRICING AND RECAST RISKS INHERENT IN ITS HELOC PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCURRED LOSSES ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE FIRM’S ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE PORTFOLIO’S RISK PROFILE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM ESTIMATED THAT ITS HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY

$3.1 BILLION

OF CURRENT JUNIOR LIEN LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS A FIRST MORTGAGE LOAN THAT IS EITHER DELINQUENT OR HAS BEEN MODIFIED (“HIGH-RISK SECONDS”)

,

COMPARED WITH

$3.7 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011

. SUCH LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO POSE A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN THAT OF JUNIOR LIEN LOANS FOR WHICH THE SENIOR LIEN IS NEITHER DELINQUENT NOR MODIFIED. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE BALANCE OF ITS TOTAL EXPOSURE TO HIGH-RISK SECONDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING INTERNAL DATA, LOAN LEVEL CREDIT BUREAU DATA, WHICH TYPICALLY PROVIDES THE DELINQUENCY STATUS OF THE SENIOR LIEN, AS WELL AS INFORMATION FROM A DATABASE MAINTAINED BY ONE OF THE BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. THE ESTIMATED BALANCE OF THESE HIGH-RISK SECONDS MAY VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER FOR REASONS SUCH AS THE MOVEMENT OF RELATED SENIOR LIENS INTO AND OUT OF THE 30+ DAY DELINQUENCY BUCKET.

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM OWNS APPROXIMATELY

5%

AND SERVICES APPROXIMATELY

30%

OF THE RELATED SENIOR LIEN LOANS TO THE SAME BORROWERS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM’S JUNIOR LIEN LOANS IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIRM OWNS, SERVICES OR DOES NOT OWN OR SERVICE THE SENIOR LIEN. THE INCREASED PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE HIGHER-RISK JUNIOR LIEN LOANS WAS CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

MORTGAGE.

MORTGAGE LOANS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, INCLUDING PRIME, SUBPRIME AND LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, WERE

$84.5 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$85.9 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011

. BALANCES DECLINED DUE TO PAYDOWNS AND THE CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. NET CHARGE-OFFS DECREASED

FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF IMPROVEMENT IN DELINQUENCIES, BUT REMAINED ELEVATED.

PRIME MORTGAGES, INCLUDING OPTION ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES (“ARMS”), WERE

$76.3 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, COMPARED WITH

$76.2 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011

. THESE LOANS WERE LARGELY UNCHANGED AS INCREASES RELATED TO PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INSURED LOANS THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASED WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHARGE-OFF OR LIQUIDATION OF DELINQUENT LOANS AND PAYDOWNS OF OPTION ARM LOANS. EXCLUDING LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, BOTH EARLY-STAGE AND LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, BUT EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENT LOANS INCREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO SEASONAL FACTORS AND THE IMPACT OF SUPERSTORM SANDY. NONACCRUAL LOANS DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR (NOTWITHSTANDING THE INCLUSION OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS), BUT REMAINED ELEVATED AS A RESULT OF ONGOING FORECLOSURE PROCESSING DELAYS. NET CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED YEAR-OVER-YEAR BUT REMAINED ELEVATED.

OPTION ARM LOANS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO, WERE

$6.5 BILLION

AND

AND REPRESENTED

9%

AND

10%

OF THE PRIME MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OPTION ARM LOANS RESULTED FROM PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, APPROXIMATELY

6%

OF OPTION ARM BORROWERS WERE DELINQUENT,

2%

WERE MAKING INTEREST-ONLY OR NEGATIVELY AMORTIZING PAYMENTS, AND

OF BORROWERS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF PAYMENT SHOCK DUE TO FUTURE PAYMENT RECAST, AS ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNPAID INTEREST ADDED TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE DUE TO NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION OF OPTION ARMS WAS NOT MATERIAL AT EITHER

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, OR

2011

. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FOLLOWING BALANCES OF OPTION ARM LOANS WILL UNDERGO A PAYMENT RECAST THAT RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE.

$523 MILLION

IN

2013

,

$709 MILLION

IN

2014

AND

$724 MILLION

IN

2015

. DEFAULT RATES GENERALLY INCREASE WHEN PAYMENT RECAST RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE. HOWEVER, AS THE FIRM’S OPTION ARM LOANS, OTHER THAN THOSE HELD IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO, ARE PRIMARILY LOANS WITH LOWER LTV RATIOS AND HIGHER BORROWER FICO SCORES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THESE BORROWERS WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE INTO A LOWER RATE PRODUCT, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THIS PAYMENT RECAST RISK. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM EXPECTS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER LOSSES ON THIS PORTFOLIO WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PCI OPTION ARM PORTFOLIO. TO DATE, LOSSES REALIZED ON OPTION ARM LOANS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE PAYMENT RECAST HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS. THE OPTION ARM PORTFOLIO WAS ACQUIRED BY THE FIRM AS PART OF THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION.

, WERE

$8.3 BILLION

, COMPARED WITH

$9.7 BILLION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

2011

, BUT REMAIN AT ELEVATED LEVELS. EARLY-STAGE DELINQUENCIES INCREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO SEASONAL FACTORS AND THE IMPACT OF SUPERSTORM SANDY. NONACCRUAL LOANS INCREASED DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS, WHILE NET CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED.

; NONACCRUAL LOANS INCREASED DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS. NET CHARGE-OFFS ALSO INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF CHARGE-OFFS OF THE CHAPTER 7 LOANS. EXCLUDING THE NET CHARGE-OFFS OF THE CHAPTER 7 LOANS, NET CHARGE-OFFS REMAINED LOW AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE TRENDS IN BOTH LOSS FREQUENCY AND LOSS SEVERITY, MAINLY DUE TO ENHANCED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND A STRONG USED CAR MARKET. THE AUTO LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF PRIME-QUALITY CREDITS.

DEFAULT RATES GENERALLY INCREASE ON OPTION ARM LOANS WHEN PAYMENT RECAST RESULTS IN A PAYMENT INCREASE. THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN DEFAULT RATES IS CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S QUARTERLY ESTIMATES OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO.

IN GENERAL, THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS WITH HIGH LTV RATIOS IS GREATER THAN THE DELINQUENCY RATE FOR LOANS IN WHICH THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. WHILE A LARGE PORTION OF THE LOANS WITH CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS GREATER THAN 100% CONTINUE TO PAY AND ARE CURRENT, THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF THESE BORROWERS TO PAY REMAINS A RISK.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE FOR PCI LOANS PRESENTS THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS, AS WELL AS THE RATIOS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE. BECAUSE SUCH LOANS WERE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE RATIOS OF THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE WILL BE LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIOS, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES. THE ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES USED TO CALCULATE THESE RATIOS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL APPRAISED LOAN-LEVEL COLLATERAL VALUES; AS SUCH, THE RESULTING RATIOS ARE NECESSARILY IMPRECISE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE VIEWED AS ESTIMATES.

LOAN MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES – RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

FOR BOTH THE FIRM’S ON–BALANCE SHEET LOANS AND LOANS SERVICED FOR OTHERS, MORE THAN

1.4 MILLION

MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO BORROWERS AND APPROXIMATELY

622,000

HAVE BEEN APPROVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2009. OF THESE, APPROXIMATELY

610,000

HAVE ACHIEVED PERMANENT MODIFICATION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. OF THE REMAINING MODIFICATIONS OFFERED,

16%

ARE IN A TRIAL PERIOD OR STILL BEING REVIEWED FOR A MODIFICATION, WHILE

84%

HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE WERE DEEMED NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINAL MODIFICATION.

THE FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURY’S MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (“MHA”) PROGRAMS AND IS CONTINUING TO OFFER ITS OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS TO FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE U.S. TREASURY’S PROGRAMS. THE MHA PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“HAMP”) AND THE SECOND LIEN MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“2MP”). THE FIRM’S OTHER LOSS-MITIGATION PROGRAMS FOR TROUBLED BORROWERS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HAMP INCLUDE THE TRADITIONAL MODIFICATION PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE GSES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE CONCESSIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OFFERED UNDER HAMP AND 2MP BUT WITH EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS OFFERED SPECIFIC TARGETED MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO HIGHER RISK BORROWERS, MANY OF WHOM WERE CURRENT ON THEIR MORTGAGES PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW LOANS ARE MODIFIED, SEE NOTE 14, LOAN MODIFICATIONS, ON PAGES

260–262

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS UNDER HAMP AND UNDER ONE OF THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE LARGELY MODELED AFTER HAMP, REQUIRE AT LEAST THREE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE UNDER THE NEW TERMS DURING A TRIAL MODIFICATION PERIOD, AND MUST BE SUCCESSFULLY RE-UNDERWRITTEN WITH INCOME VERIFICATION BEFORE THE LOAN CAN BE PERMANENTLY MODIFIED. IN THE CASE OF SPECIFIC TARGETED MODIFICATION PROGRAMS, RE-UNDERWRITING THE LOAN OR A TRIAL MODIFICATION PERIOD IS GENERALLY NOT REQUIRED, UNLESS THE TARGETED LOAN IS DELINQUENT AT THE TIME OF MODIFICATION. WHEN THE FIRM MODIFIES HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT, FUTURE LENDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE MODIFIED LOANS ARE CANCELED AS PART OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFICATION.

144

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THE PRIMARY INDICATOR USED BY MANAGEMENT TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MODIFIED LOANS REDEFAULT. MODIFICATION REDEFAULT RATES ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF LOAN MODIFIED, THE BORROWER’S OVERALL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY THE MODIFIED LOAN AND MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. REDUCTION IN PAYMENT SIZE FOR A BORROWER HAS SHOWN TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVER IN IMPROVING REDEFAULT RATES.

THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFIED LOANS GENERALLY DIFFERS BY PRODUCT TYPE AND ALSO ON WHETHER THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS IN THE PCI PORTFOLIO, DUE BOTH TO DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT QUALITY AND IN THE TYPES OF MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS, THAT HAVE BEEN SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

25%

FOR SENIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY,

20%

FOR JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY,

14%

FOR PRIME MORTGAGES INCLUDING OPTION ARMS, AND

24%

FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. THE CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO SEASONED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SHOW WEIGHTED AVERAGE REDEFAULT RATES OF

22%

FOR HOME EQUITY,

16%

FOR PRIME MORTGAGES,

13%

FOR OPTION ARMS AND

28%

FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. THE FAVORABLE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPTION ARM MODIFICATIONS IS THE RESULT OF A TARGETED PROACTIVE PROGRAM WHICH FIXES THE BORROWER’S PAYMENT AT THE CURRENT LEVEL. THE CUMULATIVE REDEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MODIFICATIONS COMPLETED UNDER BOTH HAMP AND THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS FROM OCTOBER 1, 2009, THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2012.

CERTAIN OF THESE INDIVIDUAL LOANS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED AS PERFORMING TDRS (E.G., THOSE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MODIFIED UNDER ONE OF THE FIRM’S LOSS MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND THAT SUBSEQUENTLY MADE AT LEAST SIX PAYMENTS UNDER THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS).

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, NONACCRUAL LOANS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDED

$1.2 BILLION

OF PERFORMING JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CHANGE IN REPORTING OF THESE JUNIOR LIENS, SEE THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS DISCUSSION ON PAGES

140–141

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MODIFIED LOANS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF NONACCRUAL LOANS, SINCE THE FIRM’S POLICY REQUIRES MODIFIED LOANS THAT ARE ON NONACCRUAL STATUS TO REMAIN ON NONACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL PAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THE BORROWER HAS MADE A MINIMUM OF SIX PAYMENTS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, MODIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS OF

$4.4 BILLION

AND

$2.0 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL LOANS.

REAL ESTATE OWNED (“REO”).

REO ASSETS ARE MANAGED FOR PROMPT SALE AND DISPOSITION AT THE BEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC VALUE. REO ASSETS ARE THOSE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES WHERE THE FIRM RECEIVES THE PROPERTY IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION). THE FIRM GENERALLY RECOGNIZES REO ASSETS AT THE COMPLETION OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS OR UPON EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER. REO ASSETS, EXCLUDING THOSE INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, DECREASED BY

$155 MILLION

FROM

MORTGAGE SERVICING-RELATED MATTERS

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS OF 1-4 FAMILY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS. SUCH LOANS REQUIRED

VARYING DEGREES OF LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS THE FIRM’S GOAL THAT FORECLOSURE IN THESE SITUATIONS BE A LAST RESORT, AND ACCOR

DINGLY, THE FIRM HAS MADE, AND CONTINUES TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO HELP BORROWERS STAY IN THEIR HOMES. SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE FIRM HAS PREVENTED TWO FORECLOSURES FOR EVERY FORECLOSURE COMPLETED; FORECLOSURE-PREVENTION METHODS INCLUDE LOAN MODIFICATION, SHORT SALES AND OTHER MEANS.

THE FIRM HAS A WELL-DEFINED FORECLOSURE PREVENTION PROCESS WHEN A BORROWER FAILS TO PAY ON HIS OR HER LOAN. THE FIRM ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE BORROWER MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN VARIOUS WAYS IN AN EFFORT TO PURSUE HOME RETENTION OR OTHER

146

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

OPTIONS OTHER THAN FORECLOSURE. IN ADDITION, IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTACT A BORROWER, THE FIRM COMPLETES VARIOUS REVIEWS OF THE BORROWER’S FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE A FORECLOSURE SALE IS COMPLETED. THE DELINQUENCY PERIOD FOR THE AVERAGE BORROWER AT THE TIME OF

FORECLOSURE OVER THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY

25

MONTHS.

THE HIGH VOLUME OF DELINQUENT AND DEFAU

LTED MORTGAGES EXPERIENCED BY THE FIRM HAS PLACED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS ON THE FIRM’S SERVICING OPERATIONS. THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOSS MITIGATION AND FORECLOSURE PROCESS-RELATED MATTERS AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW. THE GSES ALSO IMPOSE COMPENSATORY FEES ON ITS MORTGAGE SERVICERS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, IF SUCH SERVICERS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE FORECLOSURE TIMETABLES MANDATED BY THE GSES. THE FIRM HAS INCURRED, AND IS CONTINUING TO INCUR, COMPENSATORY FEES, WHICH ARE REPORTED IN DEFAULT SERVICING EXPENSE. TO ADDRESS ITS UNDERLYING MORTGAGE SERVICING, LOSS MITIGATION AND FORECLOSURE PROCESS ISSUES, THE FIRM HAS MADE, AND IS CONTINUING TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ITS MORTGAGE OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL ENABLE IT TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSENT ORDERS AND THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE FORECLOSURE TIMETABLES MANDATED BY THE GSES.

GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES.

ON FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE (THE “GLOBAL SETTLEMENT”) WITH A NUMBER OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND THE STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 5, 2012, REQUIRED THE FIRM TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) MAKE CASH PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION

, A PORTION OF WHICH WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO BORROWERS (“CASH SETTLEMENT PAYMENT”); (II) PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION

OF REFINANCING RELIEF TO CERTAIN “UNDERWATER” BORROWERS WHOSE LOANS ARE OWNED AND SERVICED BY THE FIRM (“REFI PROGRAM”); AND (III) PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY

$3.7 BILLION

OF ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR CERTAIN BORROWERS, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS OF PRINCIPAL ON FIRST AND SECOND LIENS, PAYMENTS TO ASSIST WITH SHORT SALES, DEFICIENCY BALANCE WAIVERS ON PAST FORECLOSURES AND SHORT SALES, AND FORBEARANCE ASSISTANCE FOR UNEMPLOYED HOMEOWNERS (“CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM”). THE CASH SETTLEMENT PAYMENT WAS MADE ON APRIL 13, 2012.

THE PURPOSE OF THE REFI PROGRAM WAS TO ALLOW ELIGIBLE BORROWERS WHO WERE CURRENT ON THEIR FIRM-OWNED MORTGAGE LOANS TO REFINANCE THOSE LOANS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. BORROWERS WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REFI PROGRAM WERE THOSE WHO WERE UNABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS UNDER STANDARD REFINANCING PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO EQUITY OR, IN MANY CASES, NEGATIVE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. INITIAL INTEREST RATES ON LOANS

REFINANCED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM WERE LOWER THAN THE BORROWERS’ INTEREST RATES PRIOR TO THE REFINANCINGS AND WERE CAPPED AT THE GREATER OF

100

BASIS POINTS OVER FREDDIE MAC’S THEN-CURRENT PRIMARY MORTGAGE MARKET SURVEY RATE OR

5.25%

. UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM, THE INTEREST RATE ON EACH REFINANCED LOAN COULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED EITHER FOR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LOAN OR FOR FIVE YEARS. THE FIRM REDUCED THE INTEREST RATES ON LOANS THAT IT REFINANCED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINING LIVES OF THOSE LOANS. IN SUBSTANCE, THESE REFINANCINGS WERE MORE SIMILAR TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS THAN TRADITIONAL REFINANCINGS. ALL REFINANCINGS REQUIRED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM WERE COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

THE FIRST AND SECOND LIEN LOAN MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM WILL TYPICALLY INVOLVE PRINCIPAL REDUCTIONS FOR BORROWERS WHO HAVE NEGATIVE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. THESE LOAN MODIFICATIONS ARE PRIMARILY EXPECTED TO BE EXECUTED UNDER THE TERMS OF EITHER MHA (E.G., HAMP, 2MP) OR ONE OF THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. THE FIRM BEGAN TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO BORROWERS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN TARGETS SET FORTH IN THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR PROVIDING EITHER REFINANCINGS UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM OR OTHER BORROWER RELIEF UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS, THE FIRM MUST INSTEAD MAKE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS. IN GENERAL, 75% OF THE TARGETS MUST BE MET WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND 100% MUST BE ACHIEVED WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THAT DATE. THE FIRM FILED ITS FIRST QUARTERLY REPORT CONCERNING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT OVERSIGHT IN NOVEMBER 2012. THE REPORT INCLUDED INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFINANCINGS COMPLETED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM AND RELIEF PROVIDED TO BORROWERS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM, AS WELL AS CREDITS EARNED BY THE FIRM UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACTIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS TO SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2013.

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE FIRM TO ADHERE TO CERTAIN ENHANCED MORTGAGE SERVICING STANDARDS. THE SERVICING STANDARDS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS TO THE FIRM’S SERVICING OF LOANS: A PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE TO ALL BORROWERS, WHICH WILL INCLUDE ACCOUNT INFORMATION, HOLDER STATUS, AND LOSS MITIGATION STEPS TAKEN; ENHANCEMENTS TO PAYMENT APPLICATION AND COLLECTIONS PROCESSES; STRENGTHENING PROCEDURES FOR FILINGS IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING

S; DEPLOYING SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON THE “DUAL TRACK” OF FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION; STANDARDIZING THE PROCESS FOR APPEAL OF LOSS MITIGATION DENIALS; AND IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON FEES, INCLUDING THE WAIVER OF CERTAIN FEES WHILE A BORROWER’S LOSS MITIGATION APPLICATION IS BEING EVALUATED. THE FIRM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE PRESCRIBED SERVICING STANDARDS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT RELEASES THE FIRM FROM CERTAIN FURTHER CLAIMS BY THE PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENT ENTITIES RELATED TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FORECLOSURES AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES; CERTAIN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY-RELATED ACTIVITIES. NOT INCLUDED IN THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ARE ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO INVESTORS WITH RESPECT TO MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; CRIMINAL CLAIMS; AND REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS.

THE FIRM HAS ACCOUNTED FOR ALL REFINANCINGS PERFORMED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM AND EXPECTS TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL FIRST AND SECOND LIEN LOANS MODIFIED UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM AS TDRS. THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM HAS BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON PAGES

159–162

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ON FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE FIRM ALSO ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OCC FOR THE PAYMENT OF CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES RELATED TO CONDUCT THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH THE BANKING REGULATORS IN APRIL 2011, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THE FIRM’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL BE DEEMED SATISFIED BY THE FIRM’S PAYMENTS AND PROVISIONS OF RELIEF UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT.

CONSENT ORDERS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO CONSENT ORDERS (“ORDERS”) WITH BANKING REGULATORS RELATING TO ITS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. IN THE ORDERS, THE REGULATORS HAVE MANDATED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE FIRM’S SERVICING AND DEFAULT BUSINESS AND OUTLINED REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES. THE FIRM SUBMITTED COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLANS TO THE REGULATORS, WHICH SET FORTH THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORDERS. THE PLANS WERE APPROVED AND THE FIRM HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THE FOLLOWING.

•

ESTABLISHED AN INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE WHICH MEETS REGULARLY AND MONITORS PROGRESS AGAINST THE ORDERS.

•

LAUNCHED A NEW CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE SPECIALIST ORGANIZATION FOR BORROWERS TO FACILITATE THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT INITIATIVE AND ENSURE EFFECTIVE COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION RELATED TO FORECLOSURE, LOSS-MITIGATION AND LOAN MODIFICATION.

•

ENHANCED ITS APPROACH TO OVERSIGHT OVER THIRD-PARTY VENDORS FOR FORECLOSURE OR OTHER RELATED FUNCTIONS.

•

STANDARDIZED THE PROCESSES FOR MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE CONTROLS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION SYSTEM (“MERS”)

AND COMPLIANCE WITH MERSCORP’S MEMBERSHIP RULES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

•

STRENGTHENED ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SO AS TO ENSURE MORTGAGE-SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING LOSS-MITIGATION AND LOAN MODIFICATION, COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

•

ENHANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR LOAN MODIFICATION, LOSS-MITIGATION AND FORECLOSURE ACTIVITIES.

•

DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISKS IN SERVICING OPERATIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OPERATIONAL, TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS.

•

MADE TECHNOLOGICAL ENHANCEMENTS TO AUTOMATE AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR THE FIRM’S DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT, TRAINING, SKILLS ASSESSMENT AND PAYMENT PROCESSING INITIATIVES.

•

DEPLOYED AN INTERNAL VALIDATION PROCESS TO MONITOR PROGRESS UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLANS.

IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE ORDERS, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO ENHANCE OVERSIGHT OF ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OVERSIGHT BY COMPLIANCE, MANAGEMENT AND AUDIT PERSONNEL AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS MADE AND CONTINUES TO MAKE CHANGES IN ITS ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE, CONTROL OVERSIGHT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PRACTICES.

PURSUANT TO THE ORDERS, THE FIRM HAD RETAINED AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF ITS RESIDENTIAL FORECLOSURE ACTIONS DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2009, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 (INCLUDING FORECLOSURE ACTIONS BROUGHT IN RESPECT OF LOANS BEING SERVICED), AND TO REMEDIATE ANY ERRORS OR DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT.

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OCC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE PROVIDING FOR THE TERMINATION OF SUCH INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF THIS SETTLEMENT, THE INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT WILL NO LONGER BE CONDUCTING A LOOK-BACK REVIEW OF RESIDENTIAL FORECLOSURE ACTIONS. THE FIRM WILL MAKE A CASH PAYMENT OF $753 MILLION INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND FOR DISTRIBUTION TO QUALIFIED BORROWERS. THE FIRM HAS ALSO COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL $1.2 BILLION TO FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS, WHICH WILL BE FULFILLED THROUGH CREDITS GIVEN TO THE FIRM FOR MODIFICATIONS, SHORT SALES AND OTHER SPECIFIED TYPES OF BORROWER RELIEF. FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS THAT EARN CREDIT UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT ARE IN ADDITION TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM TO EARN CREDIT UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS REQUIRED UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED A PRETAX CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 RELATED TO THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT.

A

REDUCTION IN NEW MODIFICATIONS AS WELL AS ONGOING PAYMENTS AND CHARGE-OFFS ON PREVIOUSLY MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S POLICY, ALL CREDIT CARD LOANS TYPICALLY REMAIN ON ACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL CHARGED-OFF. HOWEVER, THE FIRM ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS OFFSET AGAINST LOANS AND CHARGED TO INTEREST INCOME, FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME.

WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE – SELECTED INDUSTRY EXPOSURES

THE FIRM FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, THE FIRM REVISED ITS DEFINITION OF THE CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO TO ALIGN WITH THE BANKING REGULATORS’ DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURES, WHICH CONSIST OF THE SPECIAL MENTION, SUBSTANDARD AND DOUBTFUL CATEGORIES. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE RECLASSIFICATION RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF REPORTED CRITICIZED EXPOSURE BY

$4.5 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, WHICH

DID NOT RESULT IN MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE FIRM’S UNDERLYING RISK RATINGS OR THE AMOUNT OF NONACCRUAL LOANS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS RECLASSIFICATION DID NOT RESULT IN MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES OR ADDITIONAL PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. FURTHERMORE, THIS CHANGE HAD NO EFFECT ON REPORTED NET INTEREST INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THE AFFECTED LOANS. THE TOTAL CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF THE PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND LOANS AT FAIR VALUE, DECREASED BY

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS

RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY REPRESENT MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE CLIENTS THAT ARE COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF ASSETS MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS’ BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A MAINTENANCE MARGIN CALL IS MADE TO THE CLIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT, THE CLIENT’S POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED BY THE FIRM TO MEET THE MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

USES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTIES DRAW DOWN ON THESE COMMITMENTS OR THE FIRM FULFILLS ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, AND THE COUNTERPARTIES SUBSEQUENTLY FAILS TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS.

IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRM’S ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A “LOAN-EQUIVALENT” AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED ON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME DRAWN UPON IN AN EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRM’S LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS

$223.7 BILLION

AND

$206.5 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREDOMINANTLY FOR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. DERIVATIVES ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, SEE NOTE 5 AND NOTE 6 ON PAGE

$13.7 BILLION

AND

$21.8 BILLION

AT

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

IN ADDITION TO THE COLLATERAL DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, THE FIRM ALSO HOLDS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL (INCLUDING CASH, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND OTHER G7 GOVERNMENT BONDS)

DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL RELATED TO CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A NON-DAILY CALL FREQUENCY AND COLLATERAL THAT THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET SETTLED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THOUGH THIS COLLATERAL DOES NOT REDUCE THE BALANCES AND IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, IT IS AVAILABLE AS SECURITY AGAINST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CLIENT’S DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRM’S FAVOR. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM HELD

$22.6 BILLION

AND

$17.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE OTHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

218–227

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (“DRE”), AND AVERAGE EXPOSURE (“AVG”). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. DRE EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISK OF DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISK OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVG IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CVA, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW. THE THREE YEAR AVG EXPOSURE WAS

$42.3 BILLION

AND

$53.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALL COLLATERAL, OF

$61.3 BILLION

AND

$70.7 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED ON THE FIRM’S AVG TO A COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF WRONG-WAY RISK, WHICH IS BROADLY DEFINED AS THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY (AVG) AND THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT QUALITY. MANY FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THESE CORRELATIONS OVER TIME. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE CORRELATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE FIRM MAY ADJUST THE CVA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY’S AVG. THE FIRM RISK MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THE ACCOMPANYING GRAPH SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE DRE AND AVG METRICS. THE TWO MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW THAT EXPOSURE WILL DECLINE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES ARE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER) WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY SUFFERS A CREDIT EVENT. IF NO CREDIT EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE PROTECTION SELLER MAKES NO PAYMENTS TO THE PROTECTION PURCHASER.

FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

218–227

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES: FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER; AND SECOND, AS AN END-USER, TO MANAGE THE FIRM’S OWN CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS EXPOSURES.

INCLUDED IN END-USER ACTIVITIES ARE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (“CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT” ACTIVITIES). INFORMATION ON CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IS PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS AN END-USER TO MANAGE OTHER EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM CERTAIN AFS SECURITIES AND FROM CERTAIN SECURITIES HELD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET MAKING BUSINESSES. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES; FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED IN THE FIRM’S CAPACITY AS A MARKET MAKER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES IN NOTE 6 ON PAGES

ACTIVITIES, CAUSES EARNINGS VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT

REPRESENTATIVE, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE FIRM’S OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (“CDS”) PROTECTION AS A HEDGE OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES MAY VARY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MATURITY OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION (WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE SHORTER THAN THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES), THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITY (I.E., THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE LOSSES ON SPECIFIC EXPOSURES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE NAMED REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE PURCHASED CDS), AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE CDS (WHICH MAY HAVE A DEFINED CREDIT EVENT THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH AN ACTUAL LOSS REALIZED BY THE FIRM).

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE CONSUMER, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS (PRIMARILY SCORED); AND WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS. THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND THE PCI LOAN COMPONENT ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF

CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED FROM SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRED OR PCI LOANS. THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION TO PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE PRINCIPAL LOSSES INHERENT IN THE REMAINING LOAN PORTFOLIOS. WITHIN THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT, MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK TO ADJUST THE RESULTS OF APPLYING ITS STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING

178–182

AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM, AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO).

THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS

$22.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, A DECREASE OF

$5.7 BILLION

FROM

$28.3 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011.

THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED

$4.0 BILLION

FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE NON-PCI RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, REFLECTING THE CONTINUING TREND OF IMPROVING DELINQUENCIES AND NONACCRUAL LOANS (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHAPTER 7 LOANS AND JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO SENIOR LIENS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN NONACCRUAL LOANS BEGINNING IN 2012), WHICH RESULTED IN A LOWER LEVEL OF ESTIMATED LOSSES BASED ON THE FIRM’S BASE STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION. THE ALLOWANCE ALSO INCLUDED A

$488 MILLION

REDUCTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REFINEMENT OF THE LOSS ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM’S COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, WHICH REFLECTED CHANGES IN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES ADOPTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012. THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASE STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION THAT UNDERLIES THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENT HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE SPECIFIC RISKS COVERED BY THIS ADJUSTMENT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY INCORPORATED INTO EITHER THE BASE STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION OR ASSET-SPECIFIC RESERVES DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD.

THE CREDIT CARD ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED BY

$1.5 BILLION

SINCE

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN BOTH THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AND THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE. THE REDUCTION IN THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, WHICH RELATES TO LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TDRS, LARGELY REFLECTS THE CHANGING PROFILE OF THE TDR PORTFOLIO. THE VOLUME OF NEW TDRS, WHICH HAVE HIGHER LOSS RATES DUE TO EXPECTED REDEFAULTS, CONTINUES TO DECREASE, AND THE LOSS RATE ON EXISTING TDRS IS ALSO DECREASING OVER TIME AS PREVIOUSLY RESTRUCTURED LOANS SEASON AND CONTINUE TO PERFORM. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2012, THE FIRM CHANGED ITS POLICY FOR RECOGNIZING CHARGE-OFFS ON RESTRUCTURED LOANS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS BASED UPON GUIDANCE RECEIVED FROM THE BANKING REGULATORS; THIS POLICY CHANGE RESULTED IN AN ACCELERATION OF CHARGE-OFFS AGAINST THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE REDUCTION IN THE FORMULA-BASED

ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUING TREND OF IMPROVING DELINQUENCIES AND BANKRUPTCIES (WHICH RESULTED IN A LOWER LEVEL OF ESTIMATED LOSSES BASED ON THE FIRM’S STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION) AND BY LOWER LEVELS OF CREDIT CARD OUTSTANDINGS. THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASE STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION THAT UNDERLIES THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SEGMENT HAS INCREASED SOMEWHAT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, PRIMARILY TO CONSIDER CURRENT MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING RELATIVELY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES).

THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED BY

$173 MILLION

SINCE

DECEMBER 31, 2011

. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY RECOVERIES, THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN NONPERFORMING LOANS AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AS EVIDENCED BY LOWER CHARGE-OFFS, NON-ACCRUAL ASSETS AND DOWNGRADE ACTIVITY. THE RESULTING DECREASE HAS BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASE STATISTICAL LOSS CALCULATION IN ORDER TO REFLECT INHERENT CREDIT LOSSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CAPTURED BY CURRENT CREDIT METRICS AND GREATER LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY, DUE TO THE LOW LEVEL OF CRITICIZED ASSETS AND LIMITED DOWNGRADE ACTIVITY IN THE PORTFOLIO.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN THEIR MARKET PRICES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION THAT WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM AND TO DEFINE MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE MARKET RISK FUNCTION REPORTS TO THE FIRM’S CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

MARKET RISK SEEKS TO CONTROL RISK, FACILITATE EFFICIENT RISK/RETURN DECISIONS, REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK PROFILE FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS. MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

ESTABLISHMENT OF A MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK

•

INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT, MONITORING AND CONTROL OF LINE OF BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE MARKET RISK

•

DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF LIMITS

•

PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MARKET RISKS WITHIN ITS UNITS. THE INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING EACH LINE OF BUSINESS ENSURES THAT ALL MATERIAL MARKET RISKS ARE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MEASURED, MONITORED AND MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK SET OUT BY MARKET RISK. THE FIRM’S MARKET RISKS ARISE PRIMARILY FROM THE ACTIVITIES IN CIB, MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING IN CCB, AND CIO IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY.

CIB MAKES MARKETS IN PRODUCTS ACROSS FIXED INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES MARKETS. THIS ACTIVITY GIVES RISE TO MARKET RISK AND MAY LEAD TO A POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN MARKET PRICES AND RATES. IN ADDITION, CIB’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSES THE FIRM TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“CVA”), HEDGES OF CVA AND THE FAIR VALUE OF HEDGES OF THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONAL MARKET RISK POSITIONS RESULT FROM DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) TAKEN ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM; DVA IS NOT INCLUDED IN VAR.

THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING BUSINESSES INCLUDES THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES. THESE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX, NON-LINEAR INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS WELL AS BASIS RISK. NON-LINEAR RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY ORIGINATED MORTGAGE

COMMITMENTS ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE RATE INDICES UNDERLYING MORTGAGE EXPOSURE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES.

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY COMPRISES PRIVATE EQUITY, TREASURY AND CIO. TREASURY AND CIO ARE PREDOMINANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE FIRM’S LIQUIDITY, FUNDING, CAPITAL AND STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS. THE RISKS MANAGED BY TREASURY AND CIO ARISE FROM THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE FIRM’S FOUR MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO SERVE THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES, WHICH GENERATE BOTH ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS, BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.

•

VALUE-AT-RISK (“VAR”)

•

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

•

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

•

LOSS ADVISORIES

•

PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

•

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (“RIFLES”)

•

NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES VAR, A STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE MARKET MOVES IN A NORMAL MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

THE FIRM HAS ONE OVERARCHING VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES ACROSS THE FIRM, WHICH UTILIZES HISTORICAL SIMULATION BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. THE FRAMEWORK’S APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. VAR IS CALCULATED ASSUMING A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL-LOSS METHODOLOGY, WHICH APPROXIMATES A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THAT, ASSUMING CURRENT CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL CHANGES USED IN THE SIMULATION, THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES FIVE TIMES IN EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS.

UNDERLYING THE OVERALL VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK ARE INDIVIDUAL VAR MODELS THAT SIMULATE HISTORICAL MARKET RETURNS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND/OR RISK FACTORS. TO CAPTURE MATERIAL MARKET RISKS AS PART OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, COMPREHENSIVE VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE PERFORMED DAILY FOR BUSINESSES WHOSE ACTIVITIES GIVE RISE TO MARKET RISK. THESE VAR MODELS ARE GRANULAR AND INCORPORATE NUMEROUS RISK FACTORS AND INPUTS TO SIMULATE DAILY CHANGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

163

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

IN MARKET VALUES OVER THE HISTORICAL PERIOD; INPUTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF EACH PORTFOLIO AS SENSITIVITIES AND HISTORICAL TIME SERIES USED TO GENERATE DAILY MARKET VALUES MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCTS OR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE VAR MODEL RESULTS ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIOS ARE AGGREGATED AT THE FIRM LEVEL.

DATA SOURCES USED IN VAR MODELS MAY BE THE SAME AS THOSE USED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT VALUATIONS. HOWEVER IN CASES WHERE MARKET PRICES ARE NOT OBSERVABLE, OR WHERE PROXIES ARE USED IN VAR HISTORICAL TIME SERIES, THE SOURCES MAY DIFFER. IN ADDITION, THE DAILY MARKET DATA USED IN VAR MODELS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY DATA COLLECTED FOR VCG PRICE TESTING IN THEIR MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS (SEE PAGES

196–200

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS.) VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS REQUIRE A MORE TIMELY (I.E., DAILY) DATA AND CONSISTENT SOURCE FOR VALUATION AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO USE THE MONTHLY VALUATION PROCESS.

VAR PROVIDES A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND IS USED FOR AGGREGATING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES AND MONITORING LIMITS. THESE VAR RESULTS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

THE FIRM USES VAR AS A STATISTICAL RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR ASSESSING RISK UNDER NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE DAY-TO-DAY RISK DECISIONS MADE BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS. VAR IS NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF STRESSED MARKET CONDITIONS OR TO MANAGE ANY IMPACT FROM POTENTIAL STRESS EVENTS. THE FIRM USES ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES TO CAPTURE AND MANAGE MARKET RISK ARISING UNDER STRESSED SCENARIOS, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

BECAUSE VAR IS BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, IT IS AN IMPERFECT MEASURE OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND POTENTIAL LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT AND HISTORICAL MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY MAY RESULT IN FEWER OR GREATER VAR EXCEPTIONS THAN THE NUMBER INDICATED BY THE HISTORICAL SIMULATION. THE VAR MEASUREMENT ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH LOSSES MAY EXCEED VAR RESULTS. IN ADDITION, BASED ON THEIR RELIANCE ON AVAILABLE HISTORICAL DATA, LIMITED TIME HORIZONS, AND OTHER FACTORS, VAR MEASURES ARE INHERENTLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO MEASURE CERTAIN RISKS AND TO PREDICT LOSSES, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET ILLIQUIDITY AND SUDDEN OR SEVERE SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AS VAR CANNOT BE USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE LOSSES IN THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK POSITIONS, THE FIRM CONSIDERS OTHER METRICS IN ADDITION TO VAR TO MONITOR AND MANAGE ITS MARKET RISK POSITIONS.

SEPARATELY, THE FIRM CALCULATES A DAILY AGGREGATED VAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY RULES, WHICH IS USED TO DERIVE THE FIRM’S REGULATORY VAR BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THIS REGULATORY VAR MODEL FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY ASSUMES A TEN BUSINESS DAY HOLDING PERIOD AND AN EXPECTED TAIL LOSS METHODOLOGY, WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. REGULATORY VAR IS APPLIED TO POSITIONS AS DEFINED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS’ BASEL I “MARKET RISK RULE”, WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN POSITIONS INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT VAR. CERTAIN POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT VAR, WHILE THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT VAR INCLUDES SOME POSITIONS, SUCH AS CVA AND ITS RELATED CREDIT HEDGES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN REGULATORY VAR. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

116–122

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, THE FIRM WILL IMPLEMENT REGULATORY VAR FOR POSITIONS AS DEFINED BY THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS’ BASEL 2.5 “MARKET RISK RULE”.

ON JULY 2, 2012, CIO TRANSFERRED ITS SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, OTHER THAN A PORTION AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY $12 BILLION NOTIONAL, TO CIB; CIO’S RETAINED PORTFOLIO WAS EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012, THE FIRM APPLIED A NEW VAR MODEL TO CALCULATE VAR FOR BOTH THE PORTION OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO HELD BY CIB, AS WELL AS THE PORTION THAT WAS RETAINED BY CIO, AND WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2012. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THIS NEW VAR MODEL RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO AVERAGE FIXED INCOME VAR OF $11 MILLION, AVERAGE CIB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR OF $8 MILLION, AND AVERAGE TOTAL VAR OF $7 MILLION.

(B)

AVERAGE PORTFOLIO VAR AND PERIOD-END PORTFOLIO VAR WERE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VAR OF THE COMPONENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH IS DUE TO PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE RISKS WERE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED.

(C)

DESIGNATED AS NOT MEANINGFUL (“NM”), BECAUSE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MAY OCCUR ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR DIFFERENT RISK COMPONENTS, AND HENCE IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO COMPUTE A PORTFOLIO-DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT.

(D)

REFERENCE IS MADE TO CIO SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON PAGES

69–70

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT REGARDING THE FIRM’S RESTATEMENT OF ITS 2012 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CIO VAR AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN RECALCULATED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER TO REFLECT THE RESTATEMENT. THE 2012 FULL-YEAR VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE RECALCULATED AMOUNTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

(E)

EFFECTIVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, CIB’S VAR INCLUDES THE VAR OF FORMER REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INVESTMENT BANK AND TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES (“TSS”), WHICH WERE COMBINED TO FORM THE CIB BUSINESS SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE REORGANIZATION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. TSS VAR WAS NOT MATERIAL AND WAS PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER VAR. PRIOR PERIOD VAR DISCLOSURES WERE NOT REVISED AS A RESULT OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT REORGANIZATION.

VAR MEASUREMENT

CIB TRADING VAR INCLUDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MARKET-MAKING AND CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN CIB. THIS INCLUDES THE CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES TO CVA AND SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SPECIFIC RISK PARAMETERS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN VAR. REASONS INCLUDE THE LACK OF INHERENT ILLIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HISTORICAL DATA OR SUITABLE PROXIES. THE FIRM USES PROXIES TO ESTIMATE THE VAR FOR THESE AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHEN DAILY TIME SERIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS LIKELY THAT USING AN ACTUAL PRICE-BASED TIME SERIES FOR THESE PRODUCTS, IF AVAILABLE, WOULD AFFECT THE VAR RESULTS PRESENTED. WHILE THE OVERALL IMPACT TO VAR IS NOT MATERIAL, THE FIRM USES ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO CAPTURE AND MEASURE THESE RISK PARAMETERS NOT OTHERWISE CAPTURED IN VAR, INCLUDING ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING, NONSTATISTICAL MEASURES AND RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR INCLUDES THE DERIVATIVE CVA, HEDGES OF THE CVA AND HEDGES OF THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO, WHICH ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

OTHER VAR INCLUDES CERTAIN POSITIONS EMPLOYED AS PART OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WITHIN THE CIO AND IN THE MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING BUSINESSES. CIO VAR INCLUDES POSITIONS, PRIMARILY IN DEBT SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES, WHICH ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING VAR INCLUDES THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS AND ALL RELATED HEDGES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, CIB, CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND OTHER VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER, IT DOES INCLUDE HEDGES OF THOSE POSITIONS, WHICH ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE DVA ON STRUCTURED NOTES AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM; PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS; CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS USED FOR NET INVESTMENT HEDGING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS; AND LONGER-TERM SECURITIES INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY CIO THAT ARE PRIMARILY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. THESE POSITIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE FIRM’S NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE-AT-RISK AND OTHER CASH FLOW-MONITORING PROCESSES, RATHER THAN BY USING A VAR MEASURE. PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING MEZZANINE FINANCING, TAX ORIENTED INVESTMENTS, ETC.) AND PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS ARE MANAGED USING STRESS AND SCENARIO ANALYSES AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN VAR.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DETAILS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, SEE PAGES

102–104

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM’S VAR MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATED AND ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIRM’S MODELING TECHNIQUES AND OTHER FACTORS. SUCH CHANGES WILL ALSO AFFECT HISTORICAL COMPARISONS OF VAR RESULTS. MODEL CHANGES GO THROUGH A REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE MODEL RISK ON PAGES

125–126

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012, THE FIRM APPLIED A NEW VAR MODEL TO CALCULATE VAR FOR THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. (THIS MODEL CHANGE WENT THROUGH THE FIRM’S REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE MODEL REVIEW GROUP PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MODEL INTO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE MODEL RISK ON PAGES

125–126

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.)

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THIS NEW VAR MODEL RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO AVERAGE FIXED INCOME VAR OF $19 MILLION, AVERAGE TOTAL CIB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR OF $18 MILLION, AVERAGE CIO VAR OF $9 MILLION, AND AVERAGE TOTAL VAR OF $22 MILLION. PRIOR PERIOD VAR RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN RECALCULATED USING THE NEW MODEL. THE NEW MODEL USES DATA THAT REFERENCES ACTUAL UNDERLYING INDICES, RATHER THAN BEING CONSTRUCTED THROUGH SINGLE NAME AND INDEX BASIS, WHICH THE FIRM BELIEVES IS A MORE DIRECT REPRESENTATION OF THE RISKS THAT WERE IN THE PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM BELIEVES THE NEW MODEL, WHICH WAS APPLIED TO BOTH THE PORTION OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO HELD BY CIB, AS WELL AS THE PORTION THAT WAS RETAINED BY CIO, DURING THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 MORE APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED THE RISKS OF THE PORTFOLIO.

2012 AND 2011 VAR RESULTS

AS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AVERAGE TOTAL VAR WAS $152 MILLION FOR 2012, COMPARED WITH $101 MILLION FOR 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN MARKET VOLATILITY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012.

AVERAGE TOTAL CIB TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR FOR THE 2012 WAS $96 MILLION COMPARED WITH $76 MILLION FOR 2011.

THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ADDITION OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IN CIB ON JULY 2, 2012.

AVERAGE CIO VAR FOR 2012 WAS $92 MILLION COMPARED WITH $57 MILLION IN 2011, PREDOMINANTLY REFLECTING THE INCREASED RISK IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. ON JULY 2, 2012, CIO TRANSFERRED ITS SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, OTHER THAN A PORTION AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY $12 BILLION NOTIONAL, TO CIB; CIO’S RETAINED PORTFOLIO WAS EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012.

AVERAGE MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING VAR WAS $17 MILLION FOR 2012 COMPARED WITH $30 MILLION FOR 2011. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE RISK PROFILE OF THE MSR PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM’S AVERAGE CIB AND OTHER VAR DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT WAS $45 MILLION OR 23% OF THE SUM FOR 2012, COMPARED WITH $45 MILLION OR 31% OF THE SUM FOR 2011. IN GENERAL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

VAR BACK-TESTING

THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACK-TESTING OF VAR AGAINST ITS MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE.

THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR CIB, CIO AND MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING POSITIONS IN CCB FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. THIS MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE IS DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF: PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE FOR CIB AND CIO (EXCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS/(LOSSES) AND UNREALIZED AND REALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) FROM AFS SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS HELD FOR THE LONGER TERM); TRADING RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME FOR CIB, CIO AND MORTGAGE PRODUCTION AND MORTGAGE SERVICING IN CCB; CIB BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE; REVENUE FROM SYNDICATED LENDING FACILITIES THAT THE FIRM INTENDS TO DISTRIBUTE; AND MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME FOR THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE PIPELINE AND WAREHOUSE LOANS, MSRS, AND ALL RELATED HEDGES. DAILY FIRMWIDE MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE EXCLUDES GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DVA.

166

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THE CHART SHOWS THAT FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FIRM POSTED MARKET RISK RELATED GAINS ON 220 OF THE 261 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH GAINS ON EIGHT DAYS EXCEEDING $200 MILLION. THE CHART INCLUDES YEAR TO DATE LOSSES INCURRED IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. CIB AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO POSTED MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS ON 254 DAYS IN THE PERIOD.

THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH THE FIRM EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. OF THE

LOSSES THAT WERE SUSTAINED ON THE 41 DAYS OF THE 261 DAYS IN THE TRADING PERIOD, THE FIRM SUSTAINED LOSSES THAT EXCEEDED THE VAR MEASURE ON THREE OF THOSE DAYS. THESE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE VAR ALL OCCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012 AND WERE DUE TO THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF MARKET MOVEMENTS ON RISK POSITIONS IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO HELD BY CIO. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, CIB AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCED SEVEN LOSS DAYS; NONE OF THE LOSSES ON THOSE DAYS EXCEEDED THEIR RESPECTIVE VAR MEASURES.

OTHER RISK MEASURES

DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT SENSITIVITY

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROSS SENSITIVITY OF DVA TO A ONE-BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT SPREADS. THIS SENSITIVITY REPRESENTS THE IMPACT FROM A ONE-BASIS-POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN JPMORGAN CHASE’S ENTIRE CREDIT CURVE. HOWEVER, THE SENSITIVITY AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME MULTIPLIED BY THE CHANGE IN CREDIT SPREAD AT A SINGLE MATURITY POINT MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL DVA GAIN OR LOSS REALIZED WITHIN A PERIOD. THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECT THE MOVEMENT IN CREDIT SPREADS ACROSS VARIOUS MATURITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY DO NOT MOVE IN A PARALLEL FASHION, AND IS THE PRODUCT OF A CONSTANTLY CHANGING EXPOSURE PROFILE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING

ALONG WITH VAR, STRESS TESTING IS IMPORTANT IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKETS USING RECENT HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR AS AN INDICATOR OF LOSSES, STRESS TESTING CAPTURES THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM RUNS WEEKLY STRESS TESTS ON MARKET-RELATED RISKS ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS SUCH AS CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES OR COMMODITY PRICES. THE FRAMEWORK USES A GRID-BASED APPROACH, WHICH CALCULATES MULTIPLE MAGNITUDES OF STRESS FOR BOTH MARKET RALLIES AND MARKET SELL-OFFS FOR

STRESS-TEST RESULTS, TRENDS AND EXPLANATIONS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RISK POSITIONS ARE REPORTED TO THE FIRM’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITY OF POSITIONS TO CERTAIN DEFINED EVENTS AND MANAGE THEIR RISKS WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY.

STRESS SCENARIOS ARE DEFINED AND REVIEWED BY MARKET RISK, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE REVIEWED BY THE RELEVANT RISK COMMITTEES, (FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE RISK GOVERNANCE, ON  PAGES

123–125

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). WHILE MOST OF THESE SCENARIOS ESTIMATE LOSSES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET MOVES, SUCH AS AN EQUITY MARKET COLLAPSE OR CREDIT CRISIS, THE FIRM ALSO DEVELOPS SCENARIOS TO QUANTIFY RISK COMING FROM SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OR CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS, WHICH ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE CERTAIN IDIOSYNCRATIC MARKET MOVEMENTS. SCENARIOS MAY BE REDEFINED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. AD HOC SCENARIOS ARE RUN IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS OR CONCERNS. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM’S STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK IS UTILIZED IN CALCULATING RESULTS UNDER SCENARIOS MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (“CCAR”) AND ICAAP (“INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS”) PROCESSES.

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES INCLUDE SENSITIVITIES TO VARIABLES USED TO VALUE POSITIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT SPREAD SENSITIVITIES, INTEREST RATE BASIS POINT VALUES AND MARKET VALUES. THESE MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY LINE-OF-BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR TACTICAL CONTROL AND MONITORING LIMITS.

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS

LOSS ADVISORIES AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS OF RISK TOLERANCE. PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS ARE DEFINED AS THE DECLINE IN NET PROFIT AND LOSS SINCE THE YEAR-TO-DATE PEAK REVENUE LEVEL.

RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC, UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN TAX LEGISLATION, OR A PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF UNUSUAL MARKET MOVES. THIS INFORMATION ALLOWS THE FIRM TO MONITOR FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD RISK MEASURES.

NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE-AT-RISK (I.E., “EARNINGS-AT-RISK”)

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON REPORTED NET INCOME IS ALSO IMPORTANT. INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FIRM’S SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. THIS RISK ARISES NOT ONLY FROM TRADING ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO FROM THE FIRM’S TRADITIONAL

BANKING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE EXTENSION OF LOANS AND CREDIT FACILITIES, TAKING DEPOSITS AND ISSUING DEBT (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS, ACCRUAL LOANS WITHIN CIB AND CIO, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS). ALCO ESTABLISHES THE FIRM’S INTEREST RATE RISK POLICIES AND SETS RISK GUIDELINES. TREASURY, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS, CALCULATES THE FIRM’S INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE WEEKLY AND REVIEWS IT WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

INTEREST RATE RISK FOR NONTRADING ACTIVITIES CAN OCCUR DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF LIABILITIES REPRICE MORE QUICKLY THAN ASSETS AND FUNDING INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, NET INTEREST INCOME WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE REPRICING AT THE SAME TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE DEPOSIT LIABILITIES ARE REPRICING THAN ASSETS WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, NET INTEREST INCOME WILL INCREASE INITIALLY.

•

DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNTS BY WHICH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE (FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE) BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO LEND AT LONG-TERM FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED ON THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRM’S NET INTEREST INCOME WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON ITS LIABILITIES (E.G., DEPOSITS) WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ITS ASSETS (E.G., LOANS). CONVERSELY, HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES RECEIVED ON ASSETS GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO NET INTEREST INCOME, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES PAID ON LIABILITIES.

•

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE MATURITY OF VARIOUS ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MORE BORROWERS THAN FORECASTED PAY DOWN HIGHER-RATE LOAN BALANCES WHEN GENERAL INTEREST RATES ARE DECLINING, NET INTEREST INCOME MAY DECREASE INITIALLY.

THE FIRM MANAGES INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON A CONSOLIDATED, CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS. BUSINESS UNITS TRANSFER THEIR INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY THROUGH A TRANSFER-PRICING SYSTEM, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ELEMENTS OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE THAT CAN BE RISK-MANAGED IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES AND CONTRACTUAL RATES OF INTEREST, CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT SCHEDULES, EXPECTED PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE, INTEREST RATE RESET DATES AND MATURITIES, RATE INDICES USED FOR REPRICING, AND ANY INTEREST RATE CEILINGS OR FLOORS FOR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS. ALL TRANSFER-PRICING ASSUMPTIONS ARE DYNAMICALLY REVIEWED.

THE FIRM MANAGES THIS INTEREST RATE RISK GENERALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND RELATED DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM EVALUATES ITS NONTRADING INTEREST RATE RISK

EXPOSURE THROUGH THE STRESS TESTING OF EARNINGS-AT-RISK, WHICH MEASURES THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE FIRM’S CORE NET INTEREST INCOME (SEE PAGE

77

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CORE NET INTEREST INCOME) AND INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FEES (“NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE”). EARNINGS-AT-RISK EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF TRADING ACTIVITIES AND MSRS, AS THESE SENSITIVITIES ARE CAPTURED UNDER VAR.

THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NONTRADING INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE REVENUE UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THIS REVENUE, AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE FIRM’S PRETAX NET INTEREST INCOME, OVER THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS. THESE TESTS HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS THE RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR. MORTGAGE PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES COMPARED WITH UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL RATES, THE TIME SINCE ORIGINATION, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND FORWARD MARKET EXPECTATIONS. THE AMOUNT AND PRICING ASSUMPTIONS OF DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO STATED MATURITY ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR, AND PRODUCT MIX.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS ARE ALSO REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE, NONPARALLEL RATE SHIFTS AND SEVERE INTEREST RATE SHOCKS ON SELECTED KEY RATES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S EARNINGS-AT-RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES.

DOWNWARD 100- AND 200-BASIS-POINT PARALLEL SHOCKS RESULT IN A FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE OF ZERO AND NEGATIVE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH TREASURY RATES. THE EARNINGS-AT-RISK RESULTS OF SUCH A LOW-PROBABILITY SCENARIO ARE NOT MEANINGFUL.

THE CHANGE IN EARNINGS-AT-RISK FROM DECEMBER 31, 2011, RESULTED FROM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REPOSITIONING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPECTED DEPOSIT BALANCES. THE FIRM’S RISK TO RISING RATES WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF WIDENING DEPOSIT MARGINS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY COMPRESSED DUE TO VERY LOW SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, AND ALM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO POSITIONING.

ADDITIONALLY, ANOTHER INTEREST RATE SCENARIO USED BY THE FIRM — INVOLVING A STEEPER YIELD CURVE WITH LONG-TERM RATES RISING BY 100 BASIS POINTS AND SHORT-TERM RATES STAYING AT CURRENT LEVELS — RESULTS IN A 12-MONTH PRETAX NET INTEREST INCOME BENEFIT OF $778 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME UNDER THIS SCENARIO IS DUE TO REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSETS AT THE HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES, WITH FUNDING COSTS REMAINING UNCHANGED.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS SET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY AND ACCOMMODATION OF CLIENT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE. THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS. SIMILARLY, LINE OF BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR AND STRESS LIMITS AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LOSS ADVISORIES, NONSTATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS AND PROFIT AND LOSS DRAWDOWNS. LIMITS MAY ALSO BE ALLOCATED WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL.

LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED BY MARKET RISK IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LINES OF BUSINESS. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY MARKET RISK AND UPDATED AS APPROPRIATE, WITH ANY CHANGES APPROVED BY LINES OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK. SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE FIRM’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING CERTAIN OF THESE RISK LIMITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. ALL LIMITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME PERIODS BY MARKET RISK ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED.

LIMIT BREACHES ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER BY RISK MANAGEMENT TO LIMIT APPROVERS, MARKET RISK AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. MARKET RISK CONSULTS WITH FIRM SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND LINES OF BUSINESS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION REQUIRED TO RETURN TO COMPLIANCE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A REDUCTION IN RISK IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE EXCESS. ANY FIRM OR LINE OF BUSINESS-LEVEL LIMITS THAT ARE IN EXCESS FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS OR LONGER, OR THAT ARE OVER LIMIT BY MORE THAN 30%, ARE ESCALATED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE FIRMWIDE RISK COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

COUNTRY RISK IS THE RISK THAT A SOVEREIGN EVENT OR ACTION ALTERS THE VALUE OR TERMS OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF OBLIGORS, COUNTERPARTIES AND ISSUERS RELATED TO A COUNTRY. THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS, DETERMINING RISK TOLERANCE, AND MEASURING AND MONITORING DIRECT COUNTRY EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING CIO. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICY FOR MANAGING COUNTRY RISK IN BOTH EMERGING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ACTIVELY MONITORS THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CIO, TO ENSURE THE FIRM’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURES ARE DIVERSIFIED AND THAT EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE FIRM’S STRATEGY AND RISK TOLERANCE RELATIVE TO A COUNTRY.

COUNTRY RISK ORGANIZATION

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WHICH WORKS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER RISK FUNCTIONS AND ACROSS THE WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING CIO. THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.

•

DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY RISK FRAMEWORK

•

ASSIGNING SOVEREIGN RATINGS AND ASSESSING COUNTRY RISKS

•

MEASURING AND MONITORING COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE ACROSS THE FIRM

•

MANAGING COUNTRY LIMITS AND REPORTING UTILIZATION TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT

•

DEVELOPING SURVEILLANCE TOOLS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS

•

COUNTRY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO COUNTRY RISK THROUGH ITS WHOLESALE LENDING, INVESTING, AND MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. COUNTRY EXPOSURE INCLUDES ACTIVITY WITH BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR ENTITIES IN A COUNTRY. UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, COUNTRY EXPOSURE IS REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED OR WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUE IS DERIVED, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE DOMICILE (LEGAL RESIDENCE) OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR. COUNTRY EXPOSURES ARE GENERALLY MEASURED BY CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S RISK TO AN IMMEDIATE DEFAULT OF THE COUNTERPARTY OR OBLIGOR, WITH ZERO RECOVERY.

•

LENDING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THE TOTAL COMMITTED AMOUNT (FUNDED AND UNFUNDED), NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES COLLATERAL RECEIVED

•

AFS SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AT PAR VALUE

•

SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR RECEIVABLE BALANCE, NET OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED

•

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES IN MARKET-MAKING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL POSITIONS, INCLUDING BOTH LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS

•

COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING CREDIT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES, IS MEASURED AT THE DERIVATIVE’S FAIR VALUE, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL

•

CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY AND IS MEASURED AT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED OR SOLD, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ARE PRESENTED ON A NET BASIS, AS SUCH ACTIVITIES OFTEN RESULT IN SELLING AND PURCHASING PROTECTION RELATED TO THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY, AND WHICH REFLECTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIRM MANAGES THESE EXPOSURES

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ALSO HAS INDIRECT EXPOSURES TO COUNTRY RISK (FOR EXAMPLE, RELATED TO THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED ON SECURITIES FINANCING RECEIVABLES OR RELATED TO CLIENT CLEARING ACTIVITIES). THESE INDIRECT EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE FIRM’S CREDIT, MARKET, AND OPERATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE, RATHER THAN THROUGH THE COUNTRY RISK GOVERNANCE.

THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK REPORTING DIFFERS FROM THE REPORTING PROVIDED UNDER FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING DIFFERENCES IN REPORTING METHODOLOGY, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND THE BENEFIT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PROTECTION.

COUNTRY RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES FOR SOVEREIGN RATINGS REVIEWS AND LIMIT MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP USES SURVEILLANCE TOOLS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISK CONCERNS, SUCH AS SIGNALING MODELS AND RATINGS INDICATORS. THE LIMIT FRAMEWORK INCLUDES A RISK-TIER APPROACH AND STRESS TESTING PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOVEREIGN CRISIS. COUNTRY RATINGS AND LIMITS ACTIVITY ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND REPORTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. COUNTRY LIMIT REQUIREMENTS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AS OFTEN AS NECESSARY, BUT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SELECTED EUROPEAN EXPOSURE

SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING SPAIN, ITALY, IRELAND, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO CONTINUED CREDIT DETERIORATION DUE TO WEAKNESSES IN THEIR ECONOMIC AND FISCAL SITUATIONS. THE FIRM IS CLOSELY MONITORING ITS EXPOSURES IN THESE COUNTRIES AND BELIEVES ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE FIVE COUNTRIES IS MODEST RELATIVE TO THE FIRM’S AGGREGATE EXPOSURES. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AND SUPPORT CLIENT ACTIVITY IN THESE COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, THE FIRM’S AGGREGATE NET EXPOSURES AND SECTOR DISTRIBUTION MAY VARY OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, THE NET EXPOSURES MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT SPREADS ON MARKET VALUATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRM’S DIRECT EXPOSURE TO THE FIVE COUNTRIES LISTED BELOW AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, AS MEASURED UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH. FOR INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURES, CORPORATE CLIENTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

78%

OF THE FIRM’S NON-SOVEREIGN EXPOSURE IN THESE FIVE COUNTRIES, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING

UNDER THE FIRM’S INTERNAL COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH, GENERALLY CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED BASED ON THE COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS OF THE REFERENCE ENTITY ARE LOCATED. EXPOSURES ARE MEASURED ASSUMING THAT ALL OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ZERO RECOVERY. FOR EXAMPLE, SINGLE-NAME AND INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE MEASURED AT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT, NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE. EXPOSURES FOR INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SEVERAL UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES, ARE DETERMINED BY EVALUATING THE RELEVANT COUNTRY FOR EACH OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES UNDERLYING THE NAMED INDEX, AND ALLOCATING THE APPLICABLE AMOUNT OF THE NOTIONAL AND FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVE TO EACH OF THE RELEVANT COUNTRIES. TRANCHED CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE MEASURED AT THE MODELED CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ASSUMING THE SIMULTANEOUS DEFAULT OF ALL UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY; THIS APPROACH CONSIDERS THE TRANCHED NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE (I.E., THAT SOME TRANCHES ARE SUBORDINATE TO OTHERS) AND THE FIRM’S OWN POSITION IN THE STRUCTURE.

THE TOTAL LINE IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE SIMPLE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY OR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD PRODUCE DIFFERENT RESULTS.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES REFLECTED IN THE “TRADING” COLUMN INCLUDE THOSE FROM THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS

$(4.1) BILLION

OF NET PURCHASED PROTECTION IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGED BY CIB BEGINNING IN JULY 2012. BASED ON SCHEDULED MATURITIES AND RISK REDUCTION ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, THE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO RELATIVE TO THE FIVE NAMED COUNTRIES IS LIKELY TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OVER TIME.

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES REFLECTED IN THE “PORTFOLIO HEDGING” COLUMN ARE USED IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES AND DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE. THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES INCLUDE BOTH PURCHASED AND SOLD PROTECTION, WHERE THE SOLD

PROTECTION IS GENERALLY USED TO CLOSE OUT PURCHASED PROTECTION WHEN APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FIRM’S RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES. IN ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM GENERALLY SEEKS TO PURCHASE CREDIT PROTECTION WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS THE SAME OR SIMILAR TO THE MATURITY DATE OF THE EXPOSURES FOR WHICH THE PROTECTION WAS PURCHASED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE PURCHASED PROTECTION HAS A SHORTER MATURITY DATE THAN THE MATURITY DATE OF THE EXPOSURE FOR WHICH THE PROTECTION WAS PURCHASED. THESE EXPOSURES ARE ACTIVELY MONITORED AND MANAGED BY THE FIRM. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM’S CDS PROTECTION AS A HEDGE OF THE FIRM’S EXPOSURES MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE CDS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT DERIVATIVES SEE CREDIT DERIVATIVES ON PAGES

158–159

, AND NOTE 6 ON PAGES

218–227

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM’S NET PRESENTATION OF PURCHASED AND SOLD CREDIT DERIVATIVES REFLECTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS EXPOSURE IS MANAGED, AND REFLECTS, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE SUBSTANTIAL MITIGATION OF MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN ITS CREDIT DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. MARKET RISK IS SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED BECAUSE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OFTEN RESULT IN SELLING AND PURCHASING PROTECTION RELATED TO THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN EACH OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE PROTECTION SOLD BY THE FIRM WAS MORE THAN

92%

OFFSET BY PROTECTION PURCHASED ON THE IDENTICAL REFERENCE ENTITY.

IN ADDITION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED BY THE MASTER NETTING AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS IN PLACE FOR THESE CREDIT DERIVATIVES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

99%

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY PRIVATELY-HELD ASSETS AND INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY REPRESENTING AN OWNERSHIP OR JUNIOR CAPITAL POSITION, THAT HAVE UNIQUE RISKS DUE TO THEIR ILLIQUIDITY AND JUNIOR CAPITAL STATUS, AS WELL AS LACK OF OBSERVABLE VALUATION DATA. SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MEZZANINE FINANCING, TAX-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS AND PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS, ARE TYPICALLY INTENDED TO BE HELD OVER EXTENDED INVESTMENT PERIODS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM HAS NO EXPECTATION FOR SHORT-TERM GAIN WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENTS. ALL INVESTMENTS ARE APPROVED BY INVESTMENT COMMITTEES THAT INCLUDE EXECUTIVES WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE INVESTING BUSINESSES. AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FUNCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING, VALUATION AND RISK POLICIES.

THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO MANAGING PRINCIPAL RISK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRM’S GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. TARGETED LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIOS. INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE AND INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS STRESS TESTING ON THESE PORTFOLIOS USING SPECIFIC SCENARIOS THAT ESTIMATE LOSSES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET MOVES.

THE FIRM’S MERCHANT BANKING BUSINESS IS MANAGED IN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY (FOR DETAILED INFORMATION, SEE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO ON PAGE

104

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS MAY ALSO CONDUCT SOME PRINCIPAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRIVATE EQUITY POSITIONS, WHICH ARE CAPTURED WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS, HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, FRAUDULENT ACTS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES, OR VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ARRANGEMENTS. THESE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES, INCLUDING LITIGATION AND REGULATORY FINES, AS WELL AS OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING REPUTATIONAL HARM. TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS AN OVERALL FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES STRONG OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE, COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES, CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AND ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

THE FRAMEWORK CLARIFIES.

•

OWNERSHIP OF THE RISK BY THE BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONAL AREAS

•

MONITORING AND VALIDATION BY BUSINESS CONTROL OFFICERS

•

OVERSIGHT BY INDEPENDENT RISK MANAGEMENT

•

GOVERNANCE THROUGH BUSINESS RISK & CONTROL COMMITTEES

•

INDEPENDENT REVIEW BY INTERNAL AUDIT

THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN FOCUS ON THE FIRM’S CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND DRIVE CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONAL AREAS, THE FIRM ESTABLISHED A NEW FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP DURING 2012. THIS GROUP IS DEDICATED TO ENHANCING THE FIRM’S CONTROL FRAMEWORK, AND TO LOOKING WITHIN AND ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND THE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING CIO) TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE CONTROL ISSUES. THE FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL GROUP WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL CONTROL DISCIPLINES - PARTNERING WITH COMPLIANCE, RISK, AUDIT AND OTHER FUNCTIONS - IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A COHESIVE AND CENTRALIZED VIEW OF CONTROL FUNCTIONS AND CONTROL ISSUES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO DETECT PROBLEMS AND ESCALATE ISSUES QUICKLY, GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE INVOLVED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMMON THEMES AND INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG VARIOUS BUSINESS AND CONTROL ISSUES, AND EFFECTIVELY REMEDIATE THESE ISSUES ACROSS ALL AFFECTED AREAS OF THE FIRM. AS A RESULT, THE GROUP WILL FACILITATE AN EFFECTIVE CONTROL FRAMEWORK AND OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE FIRM.

THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

THE FIRM’S APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS

INTENDED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ISSUES AND MITIGATE LOSSES BY SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO

OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD BASEL RISK EVENT CATEGORIES, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED THE OPERATIONAL RISK CATEGORIZATION TAXONOMY BELOW FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS.

•

FRAUD RISK

•

IMPROPER MARKET PRACTICES

•

IMPROPER CLIENT MANAGEMENT

•

•

THIRD-PARTY RISK

•

•

EMPLOYEE RISK

•

RISK MANAGEMENT ERROR (INCLUDING MODEL RISK)

KEY COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INCLUDE.

CONTROL ASSESSMENT

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT IN MITIGATING OPERATIONAL RISK, THE BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE FIRM’S STANDARD SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA, WHICH PERMITS ANALYSIS OF ERRORS AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE OF BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE INFORMATION, INCLUDING ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS, SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND THE STATUS OF ISSUE RESOLUTION TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS MEASURED USING A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED ON THE LOSS DISTRIBUTION APPROACH. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

175

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CAPITAL MODEL USES ACTUAL LOSSES, A COMPREHENSIVE INVENTORY OF FORWARD LOOKING POTENTIAL LOSS SCENARIOS WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT IN DETERMINING FIRMWIDE OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL. THIS METHODOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

THE FIRM’S OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PHOENIX, AN INTERNALLY DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK SYSTEM, WHICH INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX ENHANCES THE CAPTURE, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER ACROSS THE FIRM.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND THE LOSS DATA-COLLECTION AND REPORTING ACTIVITIES.

INSURANCE

ONE OF THE WAYS OPERATIONAL LOSS IS MITIGATED IS THROUGH INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY THE FIRM. THE FIRM PURCHASES INSURANCE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS TO SERVE OTHER NEEDS. INSURANCE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE PURCHASED IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

CYBERSECURITY

THE FIRM DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPDATE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS AGAINST ATTEMPTS BY THIRD PARTIES TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE. THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO DISRUPT CONSUMER ONLINE BANKING SERVICES. THE FIRM HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED OTHER ATTEMPTS TO BREACH THE SECURITY OF THE FIRM’S SYSTEMS AND DATA. THESE CYBERATTACKS HAVE NOT, TO DATE, RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL DISRUPTION OF THE FIRM’S OPERATIONS, MATERIAL HARM TO THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS, AND HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS RESILIENCY

JPMORGAN CHASE’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS (I.E., STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES) IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH GLOBAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS THEY RELATE TO RESILIENCY RISK. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AWARENESS AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL INITIATIVES TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED, ASSESSED, AND MANAGED.

THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY TEAM HAS ESTABLISHED COMPREHENSIVE AND QUALITATIVE TRACKING AND REPORTING OF RESILIENCY PLANS IN ORDER TO PROACTIVELY ANTICIPATE AND MANAGE VARIOUS POTENTIAL DISRUPTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS SEVERE WEATHER, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FLOODING, MASS TRANSIT SHUTDOWNS AND TERRORIST THREATS, AMONG OTHERS. THE RESILIENCY MEASURES UTILIZED BY THE FIRM INCLUDE BACKUP INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DATA CENTERS, A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED WORKFORCE, DEDICATED RECOVERY FACILITIES, ENSURING TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT REMOTE WORK CAPACITY FOR DISPLACED STAFF AND ACCOMMODATION OF EMPLOYEES AT ALTERNATE LOCATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO COORDINATE ITS GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM ACROSS THE FIRM AND MITIGATE BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS BY REVIEWING AND TESTING RECOVERY PROCEDURES. THE STRENGTH AND PROFICIENCY OF THE FIRM’S GLOBAL RESILIENCY PROGRAM HAS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE FIRM’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS DURING AND QUICKLY AFTER VARIOUS EVENTS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPERSTORM SANDY AND HURRICANE ISAAC IN THE U.S., MONSOON RAINS IN THE PHILIPPINES, TSUNAMIS IN ASIA, AND EARTHQUAKES IN LATIN AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

LEGAL, FIDUCIARY AND REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM’S SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET, PRINCIPAL, AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISK, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE AMONG ITS MANY CONSTITUENTS —CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC — OF A REPUTATION FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY ASPECT OF THE FIRM’S PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FIRM’S REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE AT THE FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE FIRM’S CODE OF CONDUCT (THE “CODE”), WHICH IS BASED ON THE FIRM’S FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVER SACRIFICE INTEGRITY – OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE OR SHE HAS – EVEN IF ONE THINKS IT WOULD HELP THE FIRM’S BUSINESS. THE CODE REQUIRES PROMPT REPORTING OF ANY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED VIOLATION OF THE CODE, ANY INTERNAL FIRM POLICY, OR ANY LAW OR REGULATION APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S BUSINESS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE REPORTING OF ANY ILLEGAL CONDUCT, OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE CODE, BY ANY OF THE FIRM’S CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACT WORKERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS OR AGENTS. CONCERNS MAY BE REPORTED ANONYMOUSLY AND THE FIRM PROHIBITS RETALIATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES FOR THE GOOD FAITH REPORTING OF ANY ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

IN ADDITION TO TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES WITH REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE, AND REQUIRING ANNUAL AFFIRMATION BY EACH EMPLOYEE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AND HAS IN PLACE VARIOUS OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS, INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE FIRM’S CULTURE OF “DOING THE RIGHT THING.” THESE

INCLUDE A CONFLICTS OFFICE WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THE FIRM AND A REPUTATION RISK OFFICE THAT REVIEWS TRANSACTIONS OR ACTIVITIES THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO REPUTATION RISK FOR THE FIRM. EACH LINE OF BUSINESS ALSO HAS A RISK COMMITTEE WHICH INCLUDES IN ITS MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT OF REPUTATIONAL RISKS IN ITS BUSINESS THAT MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO THE FIRM.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT IS PART OF THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES. SENIOR BUSINESS, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT, WHO HAVE PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIDUCIARY ISSUES, WORK WITH THE RELEVANT BUSINESSES’ RISK COMMITTEES WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE BUSINESSES PROVIDING INVESTMENT OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS PERFORM AT THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF PARTICULAR FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS’ RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS; CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATIONS; AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS. IN THIS WAY, THE RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRM’S EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE PERFORMANCE AND RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES, AS WELL AS THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRM’S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE FIRM’S VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRM’S MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL-CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRM’S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE RETAINED CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S LOAN ASSETS TO REFLECT PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SIMILARLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS ESTABLISHED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PORTFOLIO AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS. THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS IS GENERALLY MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE IMPAIRED LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. ESTIMATING THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AS THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FURTHER RELY UPON ESTIMATES SUCH AS REDEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE, IN TURN, DEPENDENT ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICES, THE DURATION OF CURRENT WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC AND PORTFOLIO-SPECIFIC FACTORS. ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

159–162

AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DETERMINATION OF THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ALSO INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ON A NUMBER OF MATTERS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

CONSUMER LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL EXPECTED LOSS FACTORS TO OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OVER AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD TO ARRIVE AT AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES IN THE PORTFOLIO. THE LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD REPRESENTS THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATE AT WHICH THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THAT LOSS (THROUGH A CHARGE-OFF). ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS MAY VARY BY PRODUCT AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME; MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS, USING AVAILABLE CREDIT INFORMATION AND TRENDS. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT TO THE STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR EACH LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORY, USING DELINQUENCY TRENDS AND OTHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS TO ESTIMATE PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT USES ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO AND COLLATERAL VALUATION TRENDS TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PRIMARY STATISTICAL LOSS ESTIMATE.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THEN ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT THAT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION; THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE LOSS LEVELS. MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, BORROWER BEHAVIOR, THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE-RELATED SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS, UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PAYMENT RECASTS WITHIN THE HELOC PORTFOLIO, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE FACTORS CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PERFORMANCE OF A HELOC THAT EXPERIENCES A PAYMENT RECAST MAY BE AFFECTED BY BOTH THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS APPLIED IN ORIGINATING THE LOAN AND THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE PAYMENT RECAST. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS INTO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION, ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND EMPHASIZING ONE INPUT OR ASSUMPTION OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING OTHER

178

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

INPUTS OR ASSUMPTIONS, COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

OVERALL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DELINQUENCY STATUS, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, FICO SCORES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE DURATION OF CURRENT WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON HOUSING PRICES AND THE LABOR MARKET. THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO BOTH HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, AND IN THE CURRENT MARKET IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN ONE OR BOTH OF THESE FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE BOTH FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF OVERALL ALLOWANCE LEVELS, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR OR THE OTHER MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME RATE, OR CHANGES MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN THE OTHER. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES. FINALLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGES IN BOTH OR EITHER OF THESE FACTORS WOULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES, THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES OR BOTH.

PCI LOANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED CERTAIN PCI LOANS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THE PCI PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON QUARTERLY ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES OF THE LOANS.

THESE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LEVEL OF FUTURE HOME PRICE DECLINES, AND THE DURATION OF CURRENT WEAK OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REQUIRES THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. THE FIRM USES A RISK-RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS. WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN

EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN.

THE FIRM APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ESTABLISH LOSS FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING THE ALLOWANCES. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRM’S OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN AS TO THE PARTICULAR SOURCE OF EXTERNAL DATA USED AS WELL AS THE TIME PERIOD TO WHICH LOSS DATA RELATES (FOR EXAMPLE, POINT-IN-TIME LOSS ESTIMATES AND ESTIMATES THAT REFLECT LONGER VIEWS OF THE CREDIT CYCLE). FINALLY, DIFFERENCES IN LOAN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN THE FIRM’S SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THOSE REFLECTED IN THE EXTERNAL DATA COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS ESTIMATES. THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM.

MANAGEMENT ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ALSO ARE INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES SENSITIVITY

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS SENSITIVE TO NUMEROUS FACTORS, DEPENDING ON THE PORTFOLIO. CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR IN THE FIRM’S ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR EXAMPLE, DETERIORATION IN THE FOLLOWING INPUTS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE FIRM’S MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES AS OF

THE PURPOSE OF THESE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES IS TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE ISOLATED IMPACTS OF HYPOTHETICAL ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ON MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES. THE CHANGES IN THE INPUTS PRESENTED ABOVE ARE NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DETERIORATION OF THOSE RISK FACTORS.

THESE ANALYSES ARE NOT INTENDED TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY THE JUDGMENT MANAGEMENT APPLIES TO THE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY AND IMPRECISION OF THESE MODELED LOSS ESTIMATES BASED ON THEN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW POTENTIAL CHANGES IN SPECIFIC FACTORS MIGHT AFFECT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF FACTORS AND INPUTS IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS AND INPUTS MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE SAME RATE AND MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES OR PRODUCT TYPES, AND CHANGES IN FACTORS MAY BE DIRECTIONALLY INCONSISTENT, SUCH THAT IMPROVEMENT IN ONE FACTOR MAY OFFSET DETERIORATION IN OTHER FACTORS. IN ADDITION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW CHANGES IN SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT BORROWER BEHAVIOR OR OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT IN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. GIVEN THE PROCESS THE FIRM FOLLOWS IN EVALUATING THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO ITS LOANS, INCLUDING RISK RATINGS, HOME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS, AND CREDIT CARD LOSS ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSS IS APPROPRIATE.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, MSRS AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS, WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.

VALUATION

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, FOR FURTHER DETAILS SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

196–214

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR AN INSTRUMENT OR A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT, FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS MATURITY) AND USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS.

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM. FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS — INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT

180

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CURVES. FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM’S CREDIT-WORTHINESS, LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

196–214

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO THOSE USED BY THE FIRM COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS AND HIERARCHY, AND ITS DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER U.S. GAAP, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE FIRM’S PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY USED TO CONDUCT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES

291–295

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ESTIMATES OF (A) THE FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE CARD ACT, AND LIMITATIONS ON NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES AND (B) THE RELEVANT COST OF EQUITY AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS.

BASED UPON THE UPDATED VALUATIONS FOR ALL OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO ITS REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DURING 2012. THE FAIR VALUES OF ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES BY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS (EXCESS FAIR VALUE AS A PERCENT OF CARRYING VALUE RANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY 30% TO 180%) AND DID NOT INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND VALUATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY LESS THAN 10% AND THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL REMAINS AT AN ELEVATED RISK FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO ITS EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION OF THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE (A) ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR THE BUSINESS (WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING BALANCES, NET INTEREST MARGIN, OPERATING EXPENSE, CREDIT LOSSES AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL NECESSARY GIVEN THE RISK OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES), AND (B) THE COST OF EQUITY USED TO DISCOUNT THOSE CASH FLOWS TO A PRESENT VALUE. EACH OF THESE FACTORS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND THE ASSUMPTIONS USED ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATE AND MOST CURRENT PROJECTIONS, DERIVED FROM THE FIRM’S BUSINESS FORECASTING PROCESS REVIEWED WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THE PROJECTIONS FOR ALL OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SHORT-TERM ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK ON PAGES

68–69

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, AND, IN THE LONGER TERM, INCORPORATE A SET OF MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND THE FIRM’S BEST ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH AND RETURNS OF ITS BUSINESSES. WHERE POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES THIRD-PARTY AND PEER DATA TO BENCHMARK ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES.

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS, INCREASED ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS OF RECENT REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, OR ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN PROJECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BEYOND MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS, SUCH DECLINES COULD RESULT FROM INCREASES IN COSTS TO RESOLVE FORECLOSURE-RELATED MATTERS OR FROM DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES, INCLUDING DECREASES IN HOME PRICES BEYOND MANAGEMENT’S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EARNINGS OR ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESSES COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. DECLINES IN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, INCREASES IN EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR INCREASES IN THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY, COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN COMPLEX AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, JPMORGAN CHASE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THESE COMPLEX TAX LAWS TO NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS EVENTS, AS WELL AS MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN ITEMS MAY AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX JURISDICTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAWS AROUND THE WORLD ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND EXAMINATION BY THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FIRM OPERATES, AND DISPUTES MAY OCCUR REGARDING ITS VIEW ON A TAX POSITION. THESE DISPUTES OVER INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED BY AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OR ADJUDICATION IN THE COURT SYSTEMS OF THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES. JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY REVIEWS WHETHER IT MAY BE ASSESSED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS, AND THE FIRM RECORDS ADDITIONAL RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY REVISE ITS ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES DUE TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS, LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVISIONS IN THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAXES MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

THE FIRM’S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPOSED OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES. DEFERRED TAXES ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING VERSUS INCOME TAX RETURN PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED IF, IN MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT, THEIR REALIZABILITY IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. THE FIRM HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THE FIRM PERFORMS REGULAR REVIEWS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH ALSO INCORPORATES VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING STRATEGIES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE NET OPERATING LOSSES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REVIEWS, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT REALIZABLE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REVERSED IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD IF THE FIRM DETERMINES THAT, BASED ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OR CHANGES IN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL BECOME REALIZABLE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN A FUTURE PERIOD IF SUCH CHANGES WERE TO OCCUR.

THE FIRM ADJUSTS ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS NECESSARY WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD ARE MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE. AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASSESSMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REASSESSMENT OCCURS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES

IN MAY 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (“FASB”) ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE. THE GUIDANCE CHANGES AND CLARIFIES CERTAIN EXISTING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS CATEGORIZED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY (INCLUDING DISCLOSURE OF THE RANGE OF INPUTS USED IN CERTAIN VALUATIONS), AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, AND THE FIRM ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2012. THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR REPURCHASE AND SIMILAR AGREEMENTS

IN APRIL 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE CRITERIA USED TO ASSESS WHETHER REPURCHASE AND SIMILAR AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCINGS OR SALES (PURCHASES) WITH FORWARD AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE (RESELL). SPECIFICALLY, THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATES CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE LACK OF ADEQUATE COLLATERAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR NEW TRANSACTIONS OR EXISTING TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE MODIFIED BEGINNING

JANUARY

1, 2012. THE FIRM HAS ACCOUNTED FOR ITS REPURCHASE AND SIMILAR AGREEMENTS AS SECURED FINANCINGS, AND THEREFORE, THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRESENTATION OF

OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT MODIFIES THE PRESENTATION OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT ITEMS OF NET INCOME, ITEMS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BE PRESENTED IN ONE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, AND THE FIRM ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE BY ELECTING THE TWO-STATEMENT APPROACH, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2012. THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE ONLY AFFECTED THE PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES OF ANY RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL IMPACT DISCLOSURES AND WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BALANCE SHEET NETTING

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS, OR THAT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN OFFSET ON THE BALANCE SHEET UNDER CERTAIN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS THAT PERMIT NET PRESENTATION. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE IS LIMITED TO DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING TRANSACTIONS. THE GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL ONLY AFFECT THE DISCLOSURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AND WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“JPMORGAN CHASE” OR THE “FIRM”) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRM'S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASE'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE FRAMEWORK IN “INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK” PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE “COSO” CRITERIA.

BASED UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, JPMORGAN CHASE'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRM'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE FIRM’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING “MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING”. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE FIRM’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“

JPMORGAN CHASE

” OR THE “FIRM”), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (“U.S.”), WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS, COMMERCIAL BANKING, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PROCESSING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 33 ON PAGES

326–329

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE FIRM DETERMINES WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN AN ENTITY BY FIRST EVALUATING WHETHER THE ENTITY IS A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY OR A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (“VIE”).

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES

VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES ARE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AND PROVIDE THE EQUITY INVESTORS VOTING RIGHTS THAT ENABLE THEM TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS. FOR THESE TYPES OF ENTITIES, THE FIRM’S DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT HAS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS HELD. ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITIES’ VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS, OR THROUGH OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE THE FIRM CONTROL, ARE CONSOLIDATED BY THE FIRM.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS (BUT DOES NOT OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR (I) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (WHICH REQUIRES THE FIRM TO RECOGNIZE ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITY’S NET EARNINGS), OR (II) AT FAIR VALUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WITH INCOME OR LOSS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

CERTAIN FIRM-SPONSORED ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES. FOR MANY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE FIRM IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER, BUT THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE FIRM AS THE GENERAL PARTNER OR MANAGING MEMBER WITHOUT CAUSE (I.E., KICK-OUT RIGHTS), BASED ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE, OR THE NON-AFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS HAVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE FUNDS. IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE THE NONAFFILIATED PARTNERS OR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE SUBSTANTIVE KICK-OUT OR PARTICIPATING RIGHTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE FUNDS.

THE FIRM’S INVESTMENT COMPANIES MAKE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLICLY-HELD AND PRIVATELY-HELD ENTITIES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES AND ACCORDINGLY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTERESTS HELD, ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, AND ARE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

VIES ARE ENTITIES THAT, BY DESIGN, EITHER (1) LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO PERMIT THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES, OR (2) HAVE EQUITY INVESTORS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATING TO THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONS THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS, OR DO NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE EXPECTED LOSSES, OR DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE ENTITY.

THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF VIE IS A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (“SPE”). SPES ARE COMMONLY USED IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO ISOLATE CERTAIN ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTE THE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE ASSETS TO INVESTORS. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE; THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE TRANSACTION SPECIFY HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPE’S INVESTORS AND OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CLAIMS ON THE SPE’S ASSETS BY CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE CREDITORS OF THE SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE (I.E., THE PARTY THAT HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST) IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS THE PARTY THAT HAS BOTH (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND (2) THROUGH ITS INTERESTS IN THE VIE, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

193

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ITS ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE VIE AND ITS ONGOING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDES, FIRST, IDENTIFYING THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; AND SECOND, IDENTIFYING WHICH PARTY, IF ANY, HAS POWER OVER THOSE ACTIVITIES. IN GENERAL, THE PARTIES THAT MAKE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE VIE (SUCH AS ASSET MANAGERS, COLLATERAL MANAGERS, SERVICERS, OR OWNERS OF CALL OPTIONS OR LIQUIDATION RIGHTS OVER THE VIE’S ASSETS) OR HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY REMOVE THOSE DECISION-MAKERS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE.

TO ASSESS WHETHER THE FIRM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SERVICING FEES, AND DERIVATIVE OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THE VIE. THIS ASSESSMENT REQUIRES THAT THE FIRM APPLY JUDGMENT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THESE INTERESTS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ARE CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDE: THE DESIGN OF THE VIE, INCLUDING ITS CAPITALIZATION STRUCTURE; SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS; PAYMENT PRIORITY; RELATIVE SHARE OF INTERESTS HELD ACROSS VARIOUS CLASSES WITHIN THE VIE’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE; AND THE REASONS WHY THE INTERESTS ARE HELD BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM PERFORMS ON-GOING REASSESSMENTS OF: (1) WHETHER ENTITIES PREVIOUSLY EVALUATED UNDER THE MAJORITY VOTING-INTEREST FRAMEWORK HAVE BECOME VIES, BASED ON CERTAIN EVENTS, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE VIE CONSOLIDATION FRAMEWORK; AND (2) WHETHER CHANGES IN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDING THE FIRM’S INVOLVEMENT WITH A VIE CAUSE THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATION CONCLUSION TO CHANGE.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (“FASB”) ISSUED AN AMENDMENT WHICH DEFERRED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR VIES FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS TO WHICH THE DEFERRAL APPLIES, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO APPLY OTHER EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH FUNDS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

JPMORGAN CHASE REVALUES ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES.

GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO TRANSLATING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S. REPORTING ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (“OCI”) WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING NON-U.S. OPERATIONS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

FOR JPMORGAN CHASE’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, CASH IS DEFINED AS THOSE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS.

OTHER BUSINESS EVENTS

RBS SEMPRA TRANSACTION

ON JULY 1, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF RBS SEMPRA COMMODITIES’ GLOBAL OIL, GLOBAL METALS AND EUROPEAN POWER AND GAS BUSINESSES. THE FIRM ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION

OF NET ASSETS WHICH INCLUDED

$3.3 BILLION

OF DEBT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAID. THIS ACQUISITION ALMOST DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS THE FIRM’S COMMODITIES BUSINESS CAN SERVE AND HAS ENABLED THE FIRM TO OFFER CLIENTS MORE PRODUCTS IN MORE REGIONS OF THE WORLD.

PURCHASE OF REMAINING INTEREST IN J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE

ON JANUARY 4, 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE PURCHASED THE REMAINING INTEREST IN J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE, AN INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP FORMED IN 2005, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE FIRM’S CAPITAL SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION.

GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ON SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES

ON FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE (THE “GLOBAL SETTLEMENT”) WITH A NUMBER OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (“DOJ”), THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND THE STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES. THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 5, 2012, REQUIRED THE FIRM TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) MAKE CASH PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION

, A PORTION OF WHICH WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO BORROWERS (“CASH SETTLEMENT PAYMENT”); (II) PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION

OF REFINANCING RELIEF TO CERTAIN “UNDERWATER” BORROWERS WHOSE LOANS ARE OWNED AND SERVICED BY THE FIRM (“REFI PROGRAM”); AND (III) PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY

$3.7 BILLION

OF ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR CERTAIN BORROWERS, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS OF PRINCIPAL ON FIRST AND SECOND LIENS, PAYMENTS TO ASSIST WITH SHORT SALES, DEFICIENCY BALANCE WAIVERS ON PAST FORECLOSURES AND SHORT SALES, AND FORBEARANCE ASSISTANCE FOR UNEMPLOYED HOMEOWNERS (“CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM”). THE CASH SETTLEMENT PAYMENT WAS MADE ON APRIL 13, 2012.

AS THE FIRM PROVIDES RELIEF TO BORROWERS UNDER THE REFI AND CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAMS, THE FIRM RECEIVES CREDITS THAT REDUCE ITS REMAINING OBLIGATION UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. IF THE FIRM DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN TARGETS SET FORTH IN THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR PROVIDING EITHER REFINANCINGS UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM OR OTHER BORROWER RELIEF UNDER THE

CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED TIME PERIODS, THE FIRM MUST INSTEAD MAKE ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS. IN GENERAL,

75%

OF THE TA

RGETS MUST BE MET WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND

100%

MUST BE ACHIEVED WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THAT DATE.

THE FIRM FILED ITS FIRST QUARTERLY REPORT CONCERNING ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT OVERSIGHT IN NOVEMBER 2012. THE REPORT INCLUDED INFORMATION REGARDING REFINANCINGS COMPLETED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM AND RELIEF PROVIDED TO BORROWERS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM, AS WELL AS CREDITS EARNED BY THE FIRM UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACTIONS.

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT RELEASES THE FIRM FROM CERTAIN FURTHER CLAIMS BY THE PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENT ENTITIES RELATED TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FORECLOSURES AND LOSS MITIGATI

ON ACTIVITIES; CERTAIN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY-RELATED ACTIVITIES. NOT INCLUDED IN THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ARE ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO INVESTORS WITH RE

SPECT TO MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; CRIMINAL CLAIMS; AND REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES (“GSES”), AMONG OTHER ITEMS.

ALSO ON FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE FIRM ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (“FEDERAL RESERVE”) AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“OCC”) FOR THE PAYMENT OF CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES RELATED TO CONDUCT THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH THE BA

NKING REGULATORS IN APRIL 2011. THE FIRM’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL BE DEEMED SATISFIED BY THE FIRM’S PAYMENTS AND PROVISIONS OF RELIEF UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT.

SUPERSTORM SANDY

ON OCTOBER 29, 2012, THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST REGIONS OF THE U.S. WERE AFFECTED BY SUPERSTORM SANDY, WHICH CAUSED MAJOR FLOODING AND WIND DAMAGE AND RESULTED IN MAJOR DISRUPTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO HOMES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE AFFECTED REGIONS. SUPERSTORM SANDY DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FIRM.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, THE FIRM ANNOUNCED THAT IT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM PROVIDING FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW PROGRAMS (THE “INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW”). UNDER THIS SETTLEMENT, THE FIRM WILL MAKE A CASH PAYMENT OF

$753 MILLION

INTO A SETTLEMENT FUND FOR DISTRIBUTION TO QUALIFIED BORROWERS. THE FIRM HAS ALSO COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL

$1.2 BILLION

TO FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS, WHICH WILL BE FULFILLED THROUGH CREDITS GIVEN TO THE FIRM FOR MODIFICATIONS, SHORT SALES AND OTHER SPECIFIED TYPES OF BORROWER RELIEF. FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS THAT EARN CREDIT UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT ARE IN ADDITION TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM TO EARN CREDIT UNDER THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE FIRM WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACTIONS REQUIRED UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE FIRM RECOGNIZED A PRETAX CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY

$700 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 RELATED TO THE INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE REVIEW SETTLEMENT.

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

JPMORGAN CHASE CARRIES A PORTION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS (I.E., ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS). CERTAIN ASSETS (E.G. CERTAIN MORTGAGE, HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS, WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL), LIABILITIES AND UNFUNDED LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS; THAT IS, THEY ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT).

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON MODELS THAT CONSIDER

RELEVANT TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS MATURITY) AND USE AS INPUTS OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS OR OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED REFLECT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND MAY VARY ACROSS THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS.

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO THOSE USED BY THE FIRM COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION PROCESS

RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM’S VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION, WHICH IS PART OF THE FIRM’S FINANCE FUNCTION AND INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THESE ESTIMATES AND DETERMINING ANY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM’S POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS A FIRM-WIDE VALUATION GOVERNANCE FORUM (“VGF”) COMPRISING SENIOR FINANCE AND RISK EXECUTIVES TO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM VALUATION ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED ACROSS THE FIRM. THE VGF IS CHAIRED BY THE FIRM-WIDE HEAD OF THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION, AND ALSO INCLUDES SUB-FORUMS FOR THE CIB, MB, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING TREASURY AND CIO.

THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION VERIFIES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES LEVERAGING INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED PRICES, VALUATION INPUTS AND OTHER MARKET DATA, WHERE AVAILABLE. WHERE INDEPENDENT PRICES OR INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, ADDITIONAL REVIEW IS PERFORMED BY THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION TO ENSURE THE REASONABLENESS OF ESTIMATES THAT CANNOT BE VERIFIED TO EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT DATA, AND MAY INCLUDE: EVALUATING THE LIMITED MARKET ACTIVITY INCLUDING CLIENT UNWINDS; BENCHMARKING OF VALUATION INPUTS TO THOSE FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS; DECOMPOSING THE VALUATION OF STRUCTURED INSTRUMENTS INTO INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS; COMPARING EXPECTED TO ACTUAL CASH FLOWS; REVIEWING PROFIT AND LOSS TRENDS; AND REVIEWING TRENDS IN COLLATERAL VALUATION. IN ADDITION THERE ARE ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT OR COMPLEX POSITIONS.

THE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTION DETERMINES ANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO THE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTIONS. NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE FOR INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN

196

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

LEVEL 1 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY (SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY). FOR OTHER POSITIONS, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS, UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, AND, FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS THAT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA, THE SIZE OF THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. THE DETERMINATION OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS FOLLOWS A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS THE FIRM.

•

LIQUIDITY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN AN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE) MARKET. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE BASED ON THE DEGREE OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT INCLUDE: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE OR ALTERNATIVELY PRICING POINTS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES ON THE BASIS OF NET OPEN RISK EXPOSURE, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF EXITING A LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE NET OPEN RISK POSITION. WHERE APPLIED, SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE NET OPEN RISK POSITION TO A NORMAL MARKET-SIZE.

•

UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE WHEN POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT INCORPORATE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS – THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETER VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE APPLIED TO REFLECT THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE VALUATION ESTIMATE PROVIDED BY THE MODEL.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM ALSO APPLIES ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND THE FIRM’S OWN CREDITWORTHINESS, APPLYING A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK ACROSS THE FIRM. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SUCH ADJUSTMENTS SEE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS ON PAGE

212

OF THIS NOTE

VALUATION MODEL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

IF PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR AN INSTRUMENT OR A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT, FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING VALUATION MODELS THAT CONSIDER RELEVANT TRANSACTION DATA SUCH AS MATURITY AND USE AS INPUTS MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED PARAMETERS. WHERE THIS IS THE CASE

THE PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS APPLIED TO THE INPUTS TO THOSE MODELS.

THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK FUNCTION WITHIN THE FIRM’S MODEL RISK AND DEVELOPMENT GROUP, WHICH IN TURN REPORTS TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, REVIEWS AND APPROVES VALUATION MODELS USED BY THE FIRM. MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODEL’S SUITABILITY FOR VALUATION OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT INCLUDING WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF A PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT; THE SELECTION AND RELIABILITY OF MODEL INPUTS; CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS; THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY MODEL-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS; AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED FROM THE MARKET. WHEN REVIEWING A MODEL, THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION ANALYZES AND CHALLENGES THE MODEL METHODOLOGY AND THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY PERFORM OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TESTING, INCLUDING BACK-TESTING OF MODEL OUTCOMES.

NEW SIGNIFICANT VALUATION MODELS, AS WELL AS MATERIAL CHANGES TO EXISTING MODELS, ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION EXCEPT WHERE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE MODEL RISK FUNCTION PERFORMS AN ANNUAL FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK ASSESSMENT WHERE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER VALUATION MODELS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED AGAIN.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

A THREE-LEVEL VALUATION HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER U.S. GAAP FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS.

•

LEVEL 1 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

•

LEVEL 2 – INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

•

LEVEL 3 – ONE OR MORE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT’S CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. “MARKET” IS A TERM DEFINED IN U.S. GAAP AS AN AMOUNT NOT EXCEEDING FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL (“TRANSACTION COSTS”). TRANSACTION COSTS FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES ARE EITHER NOT APPLICABLE OR IMMATERIAL TO THE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY.

202

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THEREFORE, MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE FOR THE FIRM’S PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. WHEN FAIR VALUE HEDGING HAS BEEN APPLIED (OR WHEN MARKET IS BELOW COST), THE CARRYING VALUE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITIES APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE, BECAUSE UNDER FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE COST BASIS IS ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS, SEE NOTE 6 ON PAGES

218–227

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE INFORMATION, ALL PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EACH PERIOD PRESENTED.

(D)

AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM HAS ELECTED TO NET DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PAID WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLES ABOVE, THE FIRM DOES NOT REDUCE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BALANCES FOR THIS NETTING ADJUSTMENT, EITHER WITHIN OR ACROSS THE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS SUCH NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO A PRESENTATION BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY. THEREFORE, THE BALANCES REPORTED IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TABLE ARE GROSS OF ANY COUNTERPARTY NETTING ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRM WERE TO NET SUCH BALANCES WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES WOULD BE

$8.4 BILLION

AND

$11.7 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS FOR INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012,

$113.9 BILLION

OF SETTLED U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES WERE TRANSFERRED FROM LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 2. WHILE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES MARKET REMAINS HIGHLY LIQUID AND TRANSPARENT, THE TRANSFER REFLECTS GREATER MARKET PRICE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SETTLED SECURITIES BASED ON CERTAIN UNDERLYING LOAN SPECIFIC FACTORS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 2 TO LEVEL 1 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 2 INTO LEVEL 3. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 3 INTO LEVEL 2 INCLUDED

$1.2 BILLION

OF DERIVATIVE PAYABLES BASED ON INCREASED OBSERVABILITY OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED EQUITY DERIVATIVES; AND

$1.8 BILLION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO A DECREASE IN VALUATION UNCERTAINTY OF CERTAIN EQUITY STRUCTURED NOTES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, TRANSFERS FROM LEVEL 3 INTO LEVEL 2 INCLUDED

$2.6 BILLION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO A DECREASE IN VALUATION UNCERTAINTY OF CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTES.

ALL TRANSFERS ARE ASSUMED TO OCCUR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

DURING 2012 THE LIQUIDITY FOR CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS INCREASED AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY IMPROVED. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM INCORPORATED A REVISED VALUATION MODEL INTO ITS VALUATION PROCESS FOR CLOS TO BETTER CALIBRATE TO MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE. THE FIRM BEGAN TO VERIFY FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FROM THIS MODEL TO INDEPENDENT SOURCES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. ALTHOUGH MARKET LIQUIDITY AND PRICE TRANSPARENCY HAVE IMPROVED, CLO MARKET PRICES WERE NOT YET CONSIDERED MATERIALLY OBSERVABLE AND THEREFORE CLOS REMAINED IN LEVEL 3 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE CHANGE IN THE VALUATION PROCESS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S CLO POSITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

203

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS

THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING FOR INSTRUMENTS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S VALUATION PROCESS AND A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SEE PAGES

196–200

OF THIS NOTE.

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF JUDGMENT. THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF JUDGMENT REQUIRED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM. FOR INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ARE THEREFORE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, JUDGMENTS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE REQUIRED WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 AND 2.

IN ARRIVING AT AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, MANAGEMENT MUST FIRST DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MODEL TO USE. SECOND, DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, MANAGEMENT MUST ASSESS ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL DATA IN DERIVING VALUATION INPUTS — INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TRANSACTION DETAILS, YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEED, DEFAULT RATES, VOLATILITIES, CORRELATIONS, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES. FINALLY, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, THE FIRM’S CREDITWORTHINESS, CONSTRAINTS ON LIQUIDITY AND UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS, WHERE RELEVANT. THE JUDGMENTS MADE ARE TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND ITS SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS, AND THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRODUCT OR WITHIN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FIRM’S PRIMARY LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR

THOSE INPUTS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF SUCH INPUTS. WHILE THE DETERMINATION TO CLASSIFY AN INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3 IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES) IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE COMPONENTS. THE LEVEL 1 AND/OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVELS 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

THE RANGE OF VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST LEVEL INPUT USED TO VALUE THE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT/INSTRUMENT CLASSIFICATION. THE INPUT RANGE DOES NOT REFLECT THE LEVEL OF INPUT UNCERTAINTY, INSTEAD IT IS DRIVEN BY THE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OPTION CONTRACTS MAY HAVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND VALUATION UNCERTAINTY, BUT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IMPLIED VOLATILITY LEVELS BECAUSE THE OPTION CONTRACTS HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYINGS, TENORS , OR STRIKE PRICES.

WHERE PROVIDED, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THE INPUT VALUES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS THAT THE INPUT IS BEING USED TO VALUE. IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE INPUT RANGE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUE DO NOT REFLECT THE DEGREE OF INPUT UNCERTAINTY OR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. RATHER, THEY REFLECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM AND THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS. THE INPUT RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUES WILL THEREFORE VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND PARAMETER TO PARAMETER BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE.

THE CATEGORIES PRESENTED IN THE TABLE HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED BASED UPON THE PRODUCT TYPE, WHICH MAY DIFFER FROM THEIR CLASSIFICATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(B)

THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSOCIATED INPUT RANGES FOR APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND

$1.2 BILLION

OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PAYABLES WITH UNDERLYING MORTGAGE RISK HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE INPUTS AND RANGES PROVIDED FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND LOANS.

(C)

APPROXIMATELY

16%

OF INSTRUMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY INCLUDE PRICE AS AN UNOBSERVABLE INPUT. THIS BALANCE INCLUDES CERTAIN SECURITIES AND ILLIQUID TRADING LOANS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING COMPARABLE PRICES AND/OR YIELDS FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

(D)

CLOS ARE SECURITIES BACKED BY CORPORATE LOANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012,

$27.9 BILLION

OF CLOS WERE HELD IN THE AVAILABLE–FOR–SALE (“AFS”) SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND

$2.1 BILLION

WERE INCLUDED IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIO. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES ARE RATED “AAA”, “AA” AND “A”. THE REPORTED RANGE OF CREDIT SPREADS INCREASED FROM THE THIRD QUARTER TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, WHILE THE REPORTED RANGES OF OTHER UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS DECREASED. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FIRM INCORPORATING A REVISED VALUATION MODEL FOR CLOS, WHICH USES A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF VALUATION PARAMETERS AS COMPARED WITH THE OLD MODEL. THE CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S CLO POSITIONS.

(E)

LONG-TERM DEBT, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, AND DEPOSITS INCLUDE STRUCTURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE FIRM THAT ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. THE ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED NOTES IS PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON THE DERIVATIVE FEATURES EMBEDDED WITHIN THE INSTRUMENTS. THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE PRESENTED FOR DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES.

(F)

THE RANGE HAS NOT BEEN DISCLOSED DUE TO THE WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE VALUES GIVEN THE DIVERSE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

CHANGES IN AND RANGES OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT ON A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF A CHANGE IN EACH UNOBSERVABLE INPUT IN ISOLATION, AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, WHERE RELEVANT AND SIGNIFICANT. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INPUTS MAY NOT BE INDEPENDENT AS A CHANGE IN ONE UNOBSERVABLE INPUT MAY GIVE RISE TO A CHANGE IN ANOTHER UNOBSERVABLE INPUT, AND WHERE RELATIONSHIPS EXIST BETWEEN TWO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. RELATIONSHIPS MAY ALSO EXIST BETWEEN OBSERVABLE AND UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (FOR EXAMPLE, AS OBSERVABLE INTEREST RATES RISE, UNOBSERVABLE PREPAYMENT RATES DECLINE). SUCH RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW. IN ADDITION, FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WOULD ALSO GENERALLY APPLY.

IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS AND EXTERNAL MARKET FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RANGE OF INPUTS USED IN THE VALUATION OF THE FIRM’S POSITIONS.

DISCOUNT RATES AND SPREADS

YIELD – THE YIELD OF AN ASSET IS THE INTEREST RATE USED TO DISCOUNT FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. AN INCREASE IN THE YIELD, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CREDIT SPREAD – THE CREDIT SPREAD IS THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL ANNUALIZED RETURN OVER THE MARKET INTEREST RATE THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD DEMAND FOR TAKING EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF AN INSTRUMENT. THE CREDIT SPREAD FOR AN INSTRUMENT FORMS PART OF THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW CALCULATION. GENERALLY, AN INCREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE YIELD AND THE CREDIT SPREAD OF A PARTICULAR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY OR CLO PRIMARILY REFLECT THE RISK INHERENT IN THE INSTRUMENT. THE YIELD IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF THE COUPON PAID BY THE INSTRUMENT (WHICH MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK). THEREFORE, THE RANGE OF YIELD AND CREDIT SPREADS REFLECTS THE RANGE OF RISK INHERENT IN VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY THE FIRM. THE RISK INHERENT IN MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IS DRIVEN BY THE SUBORDINATION OF THE SECURITY BEING VALUED AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES WITHIN THE COLLATERALIZED POOL, INCLUDING BORROWER FICO SCORES, LOAN TO VALUE RATIOS FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND THE NATURE OF THE PROPERTY AND/OR ANY TENANTS FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. FOR CLOS, CREDIT SPREAD REFLECTS THE MARKET’S IMPLIED RISK PREMIUM BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE SUBORDINATION OF THE INVESTMENT, THE CREDIT QUALITY OF UNDERLYING BORROWERS, THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE LOANS WITHIN THE CLO STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF THE INSTRUMENT. FOR CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, CREDIT SPREADS REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE OBLIGOR AND THE TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION.

PERFORMANCE RATES OF UNDERLYING COLLATERAL IN COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATIONS (E.G., MBS, CLOS, ETC.)

PREPAYMENT SPEED – THE PREPAYMENT SPEED IS A MEASURE OF THE VOLUNTARY UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF A PREPAYABLE OBLIGATION IN A COLLATERALIZED POOL. PREPAYMENT SPEEDS GENERALLY DECLINE AS BORROWER DELINQUENCIES RISE. AN INCREASE IN PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A PREMIUM TO PAR AND AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS VALUED AT A DISCOUNT TO PAR.

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS MAY VARY FROM COLLATERAL POOL-TO-COLLATERAL POOL, AND ARE DRIVEN BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF THE UNDERLYING BORROWER, THE REMAINING TENOR OF THE OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE LEVEL AND TYPE (E.G., FIXED OR FLOATING) OF INTEREST RATE BEING PAID BY THE BORROWER. TYPICALLY COLLATERAL POOLS WITH HIGHER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY HAVE A HIGHER PREPAYMENT RATE THAN THOSE WITH LOWER BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY, ALL OTHER FACTORS BEING EQUAL.

CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE – THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE IS A MEASURE OF THE REDUCTION IN THE OUTSTANDING COLLATERAL BALANCE UNDERLYING A COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATION AS A RESULT OF DEFAULTS. WHILE THERE IS TYPICALLY NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, COLLATERALIZED OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL HAVE HIGH PREPAYMENT SPEEDS WILL TEND TO HAVE LOWER CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES WOULD GENERALLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY AND AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS. AN INCREASE IN THE CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATE, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL UNDERLYING A SECURITIZATION AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION ITSELF. BASED ON THE TYPES OF SECURITIES OWNED IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING PORTFOLIOS, CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES ARE MOST TYPICALLY AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED.

LOSS SEVERITY – THE LOSS SEVERITY (THE INVERSE CONCEPT IS THE RECOVERY RATE) IS THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FUTURE REALIZED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE ULTIMATE LIQUIDATION OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, EXPRESSED AS THE NET AMOUNT OF LOSS RELATIVE TO THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE. AN INCREASE IN LOSS SEVERITY IS GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN CONDITIONAL DEFAULT RATES. AN INCREASE IN THE LOSS SEVERITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LOSS SEVERITY APPLIED IN VALUING A MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY OR A CLO INVESTMENT DEPENDS ON A HOST OF FACTORS RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING OBLIGATIONS (I.E., MORTGAGES OR LOANS). FOR MORTGAGES, THIS INCLUDES THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO, THE NATURE OF THE LENDER’S CHARGE OVER THE PROPERTY AND VARIOUS OTHER INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC FACTORS. FOR CLO INVESTMENTS, LOSS SEVERITY IS DRIVEN BY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS INCLUDING THE SENIORITY OF THE LOANS AND THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF ANY SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE OBLIGOR.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CORRELATION – CORRELATION IS A MEASURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF TWO VARIABLES (E.G., HOW THE CHANGE IN ONE VARIABLE INFLUENCES THE CHANGE IN THE OTHER). CORRELATION IS A PRICING INPUT FOR A DERIVATIVE PRODUCT WHERE THE PAYOFF IS DRIVEN BY ONE OR MORE UNDERLYING RISKS. CORRELATION INPUTS ARE RELATED TO THE TYPE OF DERIVATIVE (E.G., INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, EQUITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE) DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. WHEN PARAMETERS ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, AN INCREASE IN ONE PARAMETER WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE OTHER PARAMETER. AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. GIVEN A SHORT CORRELATION POSITION, AN INCREASE IN CORRELATION, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN A DECREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. CORRELATION INPUTS BETWEEN RISKS WITHIN THE SAME ASSET CLASS ARE GENERALLY NARROWER THAN THOSE BETWEEN UNDERLYING RISKS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION THE RANGES OF CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS TEND TO BE NARROWER THAN THOSE AFFECTING OTHER ASSET CLASSES.

THE LEVEL OF CORRELATION USED IN THE VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES WITH MULTIPLE UNDERLYING RISKS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THOSE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THAT BETWEEN TWO INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES. SIMILARLY, THE TENOR OF THE TRANSACTION MAY ALSO IMPACT THE CORRELATION INPUT AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING RISKS MAY BE DIFFERENT OVER DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. FURTHERMORE, CORRELATION LEVELS ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COULD HAVE A RELATIVELY WIDE RANGE OF LEVELS WITHIN OR ACROSS ASSET CLASSES OVER TIME, PARTICULARLY IN VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS.

FOR THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE EQUITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE CORRELATION INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED, WHILE THE CREDIT CORRELATION INPUTS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE RANGE PRESENTED.

VOLATILITY – VOLATILITY IS A MEASURE OF THE VARIABILITY IN POSSIBLE RETURNS FOR AN INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR MARKET INDEX GIVEN HOW MUCH THE PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT, PARAMETER OR INDEX CHANGES IN VALUE OVER TIME. VOLATILITY IS A PRICING INPUT FOR OPTIONS, INCLUDING EQUITY OPTIONS, COMMODITY OPTIONS, AND INTEREST RATE OPTIONS. GENERALLY, THE HIGHER THE VOLATILITY OF THE UNDERLYING, THE RISKIER THE INSTRUMENT. GIVEN A LONG POSITION IN AN OPTION, AN INCREASE IN VOLATILITY, IN ISOLATION, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE LEVEL OF VOLATILITY USED IN THE VALUATION OF A PARTICULAR OPTION-BASED DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE RISK UNDERLYING THE OPTION (E.G., THE VOLATILITY OF A PARTICULAR EQUITY SECURITY MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A PARTICULAR COMMODITY INDEX), THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVE AS WELL AS THE STRIKE PRICE OF THE OPTION.

FOR THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED NOTES POSITIONS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE EQUITY AND INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY INPUTS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE PRESENTED, WHILE COMMODITIES VOLATILITIES WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE.

EBITDA MULTIPLE – EBITDA MULTIPLES REFER TO THE INPUT (OFTEN DERIVED FROM THE VALUE OF A COMPARABLE COMPANY) THAT IS MULTIPLIED BY THE HISTORIC AND/OR EXPECTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (“EBITDA”) OF A COMPANY IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE COMPANY’S VALUE. AN INCREASE IN THE EBITDA MULTIPLE, IN ISOLATION, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS, WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

NET ASSET VALUE – NET ASSET VALUE IS THE TOTAL VALUE OF A FUND’S ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES. AN INCREASE IN NET ASSET VALUE WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A ROLLFORWARD OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE) FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED BY THE FIRM WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

2011

AND

2010

. WHEN A DETERMINATION IS MADE TO CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN LEVEL 3, THE DETERMINATION IS BASED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE PARAMETERS TO THE OVERALL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THE UNOBSERVABLE OR LEVEL 3 COMPONENTS, OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS (THAT IS, COMPONENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL SOURCES); ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE IN PART TO OBSERVABLE FACTORS THAT ARE PART OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ALSO, THE FIRM RISK-MANAGES THE OBSERVABLE COMPONENTS OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OR 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY; AS THESE LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED BELOW, THE GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES DO NOT REFLECT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO SUCH LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INSTRUMENT, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FIRM’S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND FIRM’S OWN CREDITWORTHINESS.

•

CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“CVA”) ARE TAKEN TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF A COUNTERPARTY IN THE VALUATION OF DERIVATIVES. CVA ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW CLASSES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY VALUED USING MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. AN ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE. THE ADJUSTMENT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONTRACTUAL FACTORS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FIRM’S CREDIT EXPOSURE TO EACH COUNTERPARTY, SUCH AS COLLATERAL AND LEGAL RIGHTS OF OFFSET.

•

DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (“DVA”) ARE TAKEN TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRM IN THE VALUATION OF LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE ADJUSTMENT IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH CVA AND INCORPORATES JPMORGAN CHASE’S CREDIT SPREAD AS OBSERVED THROUGH THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP (“CDS”) MARKET.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS, EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY HEDGING ACTIVITY, REFLECTED WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF THE DATES INDICATED.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WERE

$5.1 BILLION

AND

$5.3 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED PREDOMINANTLY OF LOANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012,

$667 MILLION

AND

$4.4 BILLION

OF THESE ASSETS WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011,

$369 MILLION

AND

$4.9 BILLION

OF THESE ASSETS WERE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, RESPECTIVELY. LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3.

OF THE

$5.1 BILLION

OF ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS,

$4.0 BILLION

RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (I.E., COLLATERAL DEPENDENT LOANS). THESE AMOUNTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3, AS THEY ARE VALUED USING A BROKER’S PRICE OPINION AND DISCOUNTED BASED UPON THE FIRM’S EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES. THESE DISCOUNTS TO THE BROKER PRICE OPINIONS RANGED FROM

22%

TO

66%

, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

29%.

THE TOTAL CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT THOSE DATES WERE LOSSES OF

$1.6 BILLION

,

$2.2 BILLION

AND

$3.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY; THESE LOSSES WERE PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS. THE CHANGES REPORTED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF CHARGE-OFFS RECOGNIZED ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGE

259

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS, AND OTHER LOANS WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (E.G., RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS CHARGED OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE), SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN THIS NOTE.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE CARRIED AT AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS; DEPOSITS WITH BANKS; FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD; SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWED WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE; COMMERCIAL PAPER; FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED; SECURITIES LOANED AND SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH SHORT-DATED MATURITIES; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS; ACCOUNTS PAYABLE; AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E., DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE; RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT PERMITTED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CARRYING VALUES AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

(A)

FAIR VALUE IS TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT INCORPORATES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS (INCLUDING PRINCIPAL, CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE AND CONTRACTUAL FEES) AND OTHER KEY INPUTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED LIFETIME CREDIT LOSSES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT RATES, AND PRIMARY ORIGINATION OR SECONDARY MARKET SPREADS. FOR CERTAIN LOANS, THE FAIR VALUE IS MEASURED BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET OR LIABILITY IS THE RESULT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE AS COMPARED WITH CARRYING VALUE. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT LOSSES ARE ESTIMATED FOR A FINANCIAL ASSET’S REMAINING LIFE IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT ARE ESTIMATED FOR A LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS CALCULATION; FUTURE LOAN INCOME (INTEREST AND FEES) IS INCORPORATED IN A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION BUT IS GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FIRM’S METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, SEE PAGE

198

OF THIS NOTE.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

TRADING ASSETS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE (“LONG” POSITIONS) THAT ARE HELD FOR CLIENT MARKET-MAKING AND CLIENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS FOR CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, CERTAIN LOANS MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS AND FOR WHICH THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND PHYSICAL COMMODITIES INVENTORIES THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR MARKET (MARKET APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE). TRADING LIABILITIES INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (“SHORT” POSITIONS). THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE INSTRUMENTS AT A FUTURE DATE TO COVER THE SHORT POSITIONS.

MITIGATE INCOME STATEMENT VOLATILITY CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT BASIS OF ELECTED INSTRUMENTS (FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS ELECTED WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS) WHILE THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS;

•

ELIMINATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF APPLYING CERTAIN ACCOUNTING MODELS (E.G., HEDGE ACCOUNTING OR BIFURCATION ACCOUNTING FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS); AND/OR

•

BETTER REFLECT THOSE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

ELECTIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

LOANS PURCHASED OR ORIGINATED AS PART OF SECURITIZATION WAREHOUSING ACTIVITY, SUBJECT TO BIFURCATION ACCOUNTING, OR MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DETERMINATION OF INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK FOR ITEMS FOR WHICH A FAIR VALUE ELECTION WAS MADE

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS DURING

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK, WERE DETERMINED.

•

LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS: FOR FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN VALUE ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, AN ALLOCATION OF THE CHANGES IN VALUE FOR THE PERIOD IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE INTEREST RATE-RELATED AND CHANGES IN VALUE THAT ARE CREDIT-RELATED. ALLOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BORROWER-SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREAD AND

RECOVERY INFORMATION, WHERE AVAILABLE, OR BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR ENTITIES OR INDUSTRIES.

•

LONG-TERM DEBT: CHANGES IN VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WERE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OBSERVABLE CHANGES IN THE FIRM’S CREDIT SPREAD.

•

RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS: GENERALLY, FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT COLLATERAL BE MAINTAINED WITH A MARKET VALUE EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT LOANED; AS A RESULT, THERE WOULD BE NO ADJUSTMENT OR AN IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENT FOR INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THESE AGREEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 5 – CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE

REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN THE CREDIT APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS, AND RISK LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED AS NEEDED TO REFLECT THE FIRM’S RISK APPETITE.

IN THE FIRM’S CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WITH A KEY FOCUS ON TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE POTENTIAL RISK CONCENTRATIONS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES. IN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND MONITORED REGULARLY ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN SYNDICATIONS AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, USE OF MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY PARTICULAR LOAN PRODUCT (E.G., OPTION ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES (“ARMS”)), INDUSTRY SEGMENT (E.G., COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE) OR ITS EXPOSURE TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRM’S ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES REPRESENTING PRIMARILY MARGIN LOANS TO PRIME AND RETAIL BROKERAGE CLIENTS OF

$23.8 BILLION

AND

$17.6 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THESE MARGIN LOANS ARE GENERALLY OVER-COLLATERALIZED THROUGH A PLEDGE OF ASSETS MAINTAINED IN CLIENTS’ BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO DAILY MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COLLATERAL VALUE DECREASES, A MAINTENANCE MARGIN CALL IS MADE TO THE CLIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL INTO THE ACCOUNT. IF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT, THE CLIENT’S POSITIONS MAY BE LIQUIDATED BY THE FIRM TO MEET THE MINIMUM COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES, THE FIRM DOES NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT IMPAIRMENT ON THESE RECEIVABLES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011.

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS BOTH ON–BALANCE SHEET AND OFF–BALANCE SHEET CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE-RELATED CREDIT EXPOSURE BY THE FIRM’S THREE CREDIT PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS AS OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END-USERS TO MODIFY OR MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS. COUNTERPARTIES TO A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT SEEK TO OBTAIN RISKS AND REWARDS SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM PURCHASING OR SELLING A RELATED CASH INSTRUMENT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXCHANGE UPFRONT THE FULL PURCHASE OR SALES PRICE. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO USES DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE OR MANAGE ITS OWN RISK EXPOSURES. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING OR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

MARKET-MAKING DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRM’S DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR MARKET-MAKING PURPOSES. CUSTOMERS USE DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE OR MODIFY INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY RISKS. THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS FROM ITS EXPOSURE TO THESE DERIVATIVES BY ENTERING INTO OTHER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS OR BY PURCHASING OR SELLING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET THE EXPOSURE FROM CLIENT DERIVATIVES. THE FIRM ALSO SEEKS TO EARN A SPREAD BETWEEN THE CLIENT DERIVATIVES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, AND FROM THE REMAINING OPEN RISK POSITIONS.

RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES

THE FIRM MANAGES ITS MARKET RISK EXPOSURES USING VARIOUS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MINIMIZE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS THAT ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPRECIATE OR DEPRECIATE IN MARKET VALUE AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE. SIMILARLY, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASES OR DECREASES AS A RESULT OF VARIABLE-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESETTING TO CURRENT MARKET RATES, AND AS A RESULT OF THE REPAYMENT AND SUBSEQUENT ORIGINATION OR ISSUANCE OF FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT CURRENT MARKET RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY IN EARNINGS. THE FIRM GENERALLY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FUTURES TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED (I.E., NON-U.S. DOLLAR) ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE U.S. DOLLAR–EQUIVALENT VALUES OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED REVENUE OR EXPENSE INCREASE OR DECREASE. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THIS VARIABILITY.

COMMODITIES CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE DEPRECIATION OR APPRECIATION OF THE RELATED INVENTORY.

ALSO IN THE COMMODITIES PORTFOLIO, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND FORWARDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY-RELATED TOLLING AND LOAD-SERVING CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS.

THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. CREDIT DERIVATIVES COMPENSATE THE PURCHASER WHEN THE ENTITY REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR A FAILURE TO PAY AN OBLIGATION WHEN DUE. CREDIT DERIVATIVES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES SECTION ON PAGES

226–227

OF THIS NOTE.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES, SEE THE RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES GAINS AND LOSSES TABLE ON PAGE

224

OF THIS NOTE, AND THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING GAINS AND LOSSES TABLES ON PAGES 222–224 OF THIS NOTE.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. AS PERMITTED UNDER U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM NETS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE RELATED CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE REPORTED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. THE TABULAR DISCLOSURES ON PAGES 220–227 OF THIS NOTE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF, AND REPORTING FOR, DERIVATIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN STRUCTURED NOTES, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 ON PAGES

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE FIRM APPLIES HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVES EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES – GENERALLY INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. HOWEVER, JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN THE FIRM’S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO PURCHASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS HEDGES. FOR THE SAME REASON, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES USED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. IN ADDITION, FOR A DERIVATIVE TO BE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY MUST BE DOCUMENTED. HEDGE DOCUMENTATION MUST IDENTIFY THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE ASSET OR LIABILITY OR FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND TYPE OF RISK TO BE HEDGED, AND HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DERIVATIVE IS ASSESSED

218

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS, THE FIRM USES STATISTICAL METHODS SUCH AS REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS NONSTATISTICAL METHODS INCLUDING DOLLAR-VALUE COMPARISONS OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A DERIVATIVE HAS BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM MUST BE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AT LEAST QUARTERLY. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EXACTLY OFFSET THE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK) MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT HEDGING THE DESIGNATED EXPOSURE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATIONS: FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. JPMORGAN CHASE USES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, AFS SECURITIES AND CERTAIN COMMODITIES INVENTORIES. FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE, AND IN THE VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART OF THE BASIS OF THE HEDGED ITEM AND FOR INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY NET INTEREST INCOME AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES CASH FLOW HEDGES PRIMARILY TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN FORECASTED CASH FLOWS FROM FLOATING-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY–DENOMINATED REVENUE AND EXPENSE. FOR QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN OCI AND RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS. DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS AFFECTING EARNINGS ARE RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM – PRIMARILY INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, NONINTEREST REVENUE AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) (“AOCI”) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED AFFECT EARNINGS. FOR HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL HEDGE FORECAST, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE VALUES RECORDED IN AOCI ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE FIRM’S NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OR BRANCHES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN AOCI.

SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS A PORTFOLIO OF INDEX CREDIT DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING SHORT AND LONG POSITIONS, THAT WAS HELD BY CIO. ON JULY 2, 2012, CIO TRANSFERRED THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, OTHER THAN A PORTION THAT AGGREGATED TO A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY

$12 BILLION

, TO CIB. THE POSITIONS MAKING UP THE PORTION OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO RETAINED BY CIO ON JULY 2, 2012, WERE EFFECTIVELY CLOSED OUT DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012. THE RESULTS OF THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE PORTION TRANSFERRED TO CIB, HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES RELATED TO MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER DERIVATIVES CATEGORY DISCUSSED ON PAGE

CREDIT RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS INTRODUCED BY EACH DERIVATIVE CONTRACT TYPE, DERIVATIVES EXPOSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO CREDIT RISK — THE RISK THAT DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES MAY FAIL TO MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND THE COLLATERAL, IF ANY, HELD BY THE FIRM PROVES TO BE OF INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO COVER THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION. IT IS THE POLICY OF JPMORGAN CHASE TO ACTIVELY PURSUE THE USE OF LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND CASH COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

WHILE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK, DERIVATIVE PAYABLES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO LIQUIDITY RISK, AS THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO POST CASH OR SECURITIES COLLATERAL WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS MOVES IN THE COUNTERPARTIES’ FAVOR OR UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THE FIRM’S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES’ RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE PAYABLES THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION FEATURES

DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO BE POSTED OR TERMINATIONS TO BE TRIGGERED WHEN THE PREDEFINED THRESHOLD RATING IS BREACHED. A DOWNGRADE BY A SINGLE RATING AGENCY THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN A RATING LOWER THAN A PREEXISTING CORRESPONDING RATING PROVIDED BY ANOTHER MAJOR RATING AGENCY WILL GENERALLY NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES

CREDIT DERIVATIVES ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS DERIVED FROM THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEBT OF A THIRD-PARTY ISSUER (THE REFERENCE ENTITY) AND WHICH ALLOW ONE PARTY (THE PROTECTION PURCHASER) TO TRANSFER THAT RISK TO ANOTHER PARTY (THE PROTECTION SELLER). CREDIT DERIVATIVES EXPOSE THE PROTECTION PURCHASER TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE PROTECTION SELLER, AS THE PROTECTION SELLER IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, SUCH AS A BANKRUPTCY, A FAILURE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION OR A RESTRUCTURING. THE SELLER OF CREDIT PROTECTION RECEIVES A PREMIUM FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION BUT HAS THE RISK THAT THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENT REFERENCED IN THE CONTRACT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CREDIT EVENT.

THE FIRM IS BOTH A PURCHASER AND SELLER OF PROTECTION IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET AND USES THESE DERIVATIVES FOR TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES. FIRST, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MARKET-MAKER, THE FIRM ACTIVELY MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES BY PURCHASING AND SELLING CREDIT PROTECTION, PREDOMINANTLY ON CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. SECOND, AS AN END-USER, THE FIRM USES CREDIT DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING EXPOSURES (LOANS AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS) AND DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES IN THE FIRM’S WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, AND TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM CERTAIN AFS SECURITIES AND FROM CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO, SEE THE DISCUSSION ON PAGE 220 OF THIS NOTE. FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY REFERENCE THE CREDIT OF EITHER A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY (“SINGLE-NAME”) OR A BROAD-BASED INDEX. THE FIRM PURCHASES AND SELLS PROTECTION ON BOTH SINGLE- NAME AND INDEX-REFERENCE OBLIGATIONS. SINGLE-NAME CDS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE OTC DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. SINGLE-NAME CDS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE REFERENCE ENTITY, WHILE INDEX CDS CONTRACTS ARE USED TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROADER CREDIT MARKETS OR CREDIT MARKET SEGMENTS. LIKE THE S&P 500 AND OTHER MARKET INDICES, A CDS INDEX COMPRISES A PORTFOLIO OF CDS ACROSS MANY REFERENCE ENTITIES. NEW SERIES OF CDS INDICES ARE PERIODICALLY ESTABLISHED WITH A NEW UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF REFERENCE ENTITIES TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. IF ONE OF THE REFERENCE ENTITIES IN THE INDEX EXPERIENCES A CREDIT EVENT, THEN THE REFERENCE ENTITY THAT DEFAULTED IS REMOVED FROM THE INDEX. CDS CAN ALSO BE REFERENCED AGAINST SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF REFERENCE NAMES OR AGAINST CUSTOMIZED EXPOSURE LEVELS BASED ON SPECIFIC CLIENT DEMANDS: FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST THE FIRST

$1 MILLION

OF REALIZED CREDIT LOSSES IN A

$10 MILLION

PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURE. SUCH STRUCTURES ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS TRANCHE CDS.

FOR BOTH SINGLE-NAME CDS CONTRACTS AND INDEX CDS CONTRACTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, UNDER THE TERMS OF A CDS CONTRACT NEITHER PARTY TO THE CDS CONTRACT HAS RECOURSE TO THE REFERENCE ENTITY. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER HAS RECOURSE TO THE PROTECTION SELLER FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE VALUE OF THE CDS CONTRACT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLING THE CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RECOVERY VALUE. THE PROTECTION PURCHASER DOES NOT NEED TO HOLD THE DEBT INSTRUMENT OF THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE CDS CONTRACT WHEN A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTES

A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE IS A FUNDED CREDIT DERIVATIVE WHERE THE ISSUER OF THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE PURCHASES FROM THE NOTE INVESTOR CREDIT PROTECTION ON A REFERENCED ENTITY. UNDER THE CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR PAYS THE ISSUER THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION, AND IN RETURN, THE ISSUER PAYS PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO THE INVESTOR, BASED ON THE CREDIT RISK OF THE REFERENCED ENTITY. THE ISSUER ALSO REPAYS THE INVESTOR THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AT MATURITY UNLESS THE REFERENCE ENTITY EXPERIENCES A SPECIFIED CREDIT EVENT. IF A CREDIT EVENT OCCURS, THE ISSUER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE, BUT RATHER, THE ISSUER PAYS THE INVESTOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAR VALUE OF THE NOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEFAULTED REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. NEITHER PARTY TO THE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE HAS RECOURSE TO THE DEFAULTING REFERENCE ENTITY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT-RELATED NOTES, SEE NOTE 16 ON PAGES

280–291

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND CREDIT-RELATED NOTES THE FIRM SOLD AND PURCHASED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

. UPON A CREDIT EVENT, THE FIRM AS A SELLER OF PROTECTION WOULD TYPICALLY PAY OUT ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE FULL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF NET PROTECTION SOLD, AS THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID ON THE CONTRACTS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT. THE FIRM MANAGES THE CREDIT RISK ON CONTRACTS TO SELL PROTECTION BY PURCHASING PROTECTION WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITIES. OTHER PURCHASED PROTECTION REFERENCED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDES CREDIT DERIVATIVES BOUGHT ON RELATED, BUT NOT IDENTICAL, REFERENCE POSITIONS (INCLUDING INDICES, PORTFOLIO COVERAGE AND OTHER REFERENCE POINTS) AS WELL AS PROTECTION PURCHASED THROUGH CREDIT-RELATED NOTES.

226

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM DOES NOT USE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES AS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FOR SUCH DERIVATIVES, BECAUSE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABILITY OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A CREDIT EVENT, THE RECOVERY VALUE OF THE REFERENCE OBLIGATION, OR RELATED CASH INSTRUMENTS AND ECONOMIC HEDGES, EACH OF WHICH REDUCES, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVES.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 9 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE FIRM’S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (“OPEB”) PLANS (COLLECTIVELY THE “PLANS”) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA IN THE FORM OF PAY AND INTEREST CREDITS TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED ON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRM ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION, AGE AND/OR YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRM’S POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. THE FIRM DOES

NO

T ANTICIPATE AT THIS TIME ANY CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IN

2013

. THE

2013

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

$40 MILLION

OF WHICH

$36 MILLION

ARE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EARNED PAY CREDITS ON COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW UNDER A QUALIFIED PLAN; NO FURTHER PAY CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED UNDER THIS PLAN. THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN HAD AN UNFUNDED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN THE AMOUNT OF

$276 MILLION

AND

$272 MILLION

, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE MARCH 19, 2012, PURSUANT TO THE

WAMU GLOBAL SETTLEMENT,

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. BECAME THE SPONSOR OF THE WAMU PENSION PLAN. THIS PLAN’S ASSETS WERE MERGED WITH AND INTO THE JPMORGAN CHASE RETIREMENT PLAN EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE CURRENTLY PROVIDES TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE JPMORGAN CHASE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE “401(K) SAVINGS PLAN”), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRETAX AND ROTH 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND, WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT OPTION UNDER THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN.

THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO

5%

OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION (E.G., BASE PAY) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A ONE-YEAR-OF-SERVICE REQUIREMENT. EMPLOYEES WITH TOTAL ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION OF

$250,000

OR MORE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2009. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALSO PERMITS DISCRETIONARY PROFIT-SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED VESTING SCHEDULE.

OPEB PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS TO QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH THE LENGTH OF SERVICE AND THE DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRM’S SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE BOTH CONTRIBUTORY. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S U.S. OPEB OBLIGATION IS FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (“COLI”) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR ITS NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE U.K. OPEB PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

GAINS AND LOSSES

FOR THE FIRM’S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS. ANY EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IS CURRENTLY

NINE YEARS

. IN ADDITION, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLAN WHEN THE PRIOR SERVICE COST IS FIRST RECOGNIZED. THE AVERAGE REMAINING AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CURRENT PRIOR SERVICE COSTS IS

SIX YEARS.

FOR THE FIRM’S OPEB PLANS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A

FIVE

-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. THIS VALUE IS REFERRED TO AS THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES, ADJUSTED FOR GAINS AND LOSSES NOT YET RECOGNIZED, IS INCLUDED IN ANNUAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IF, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS

10%

OF THE GREATER OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. ANY EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR’S PROJECTED LONG-TERM (

10 YEARS

OR MORE) RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE ASSET ALLOCATION. RETURNS ON ASSET CLASSES ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH AND ARE NOT STRICTLY BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO MIX OF EACH PLAN; AS A RESULT, IN

2012

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINED THE SAME EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. THE RETURN ON EQUITIES HAS BEEN SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON “AA” RATED LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS IS BASED ON AN IMPLIED YIELD FOR SIMILAR BONDS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELDS ON PORTFOLIOS OF BONDS WITH MATURITY DATES AND COUPONS THAT CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLAN’S PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH PORTFOLIOS ARE DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THESE HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIOS GENERATE EXCESS CASH, SUCH EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN REPRESENTS A RATE IMPLIED FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE “AA”

-YEAR-PLUS BOND INDEX.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM DECREASED THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO DETERMINE ITS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY

$48 MILLION

FOR

2013

. THE

2013

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND U.S. OPEB PLAN ASSETS ARE

7.50%

AND

6.25%

, RESPECTIVELY, UNCHANGED FROM

2012

. FOR 2013, THE INITIAL HEALTH CARE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION HAS BEEN SET AT

7.00%

, AND THE ULTIMATE HEALTH CARE TREND ASSUMPTION AND THE YEAR TO REACH THE ULTIMATE RATE REMAINS AT

5.00%

AND

2017

, RESPECTIVELY, UNCHANGED FROM 2012. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION AND THE ASSUMED RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE REMAINED AT

5.00%

AND

4.00%

, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE

$35 MILLION

IN

2013

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN

2013

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE

$19 MILLION

AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY AN AGGREGATE

$272 MILLION

. A 25-BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE FOR THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

2013

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY

$25 MILLION

AND A

DECREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY

$116 MILLION

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN TRUST AND ARE INVESTED IN A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (E.G., HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS). NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE ALSO INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRM’S COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS.

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRM’S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS AND GOALS USING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER. ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. PERIODICALLY THE FIRM PERFORMS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS ON THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS, INCORPORATING PROJECTED ASSET AND LIABILITY DATA, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION ON CUMULATIVE PENSION EXPENSE, ECONOMIC COST, PRESENT VALUE OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDED STATUS. CURRENTLY, APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES ARE: U.S. EQUITY

15%

TO

35%

, INTERNATIONAL EQUITY

15%

TO

25%

, DEBT SECURITIES

10%

TO

30%

, HEDGE FUNDS

10%

TO

30%

, AND REAL ESTATE, REAL ASSETS AND PRIVATE EQUITY

5%

TO

20%

. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT MANAGED TO A SPECIFIC TARGET BUT SEEK TO SHIFT ASSET CLASS ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THESE STATED RANGES. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES INCORPORATE THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPLICATIONS OF THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES WHILE MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE PLAN. THE FIRM REGULARLY REVIEWS THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

235

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASSET MANAGERS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

FOR THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WHICH REPRESENT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITIES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY IN RETURNS RELATIVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY PROFILES, THE U.K. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS’ LARGEST ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE TO DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROPRIATE DURATIONS. OTHER ASSETS, MAINLY EQUITY SECURITIES, ARE THEN INVESTED FOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION, TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT GROWTH. SIMILAR TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND ASSET MANAGERS FOR THE U.K. PLANS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND THE PORTFOLIO IS REBALANCED WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY.

INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PLANS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS SUCH AS INTEREST RATE, MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS. EXPOSURE TO A CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY THE BROAD DIVERSIFICATION OF BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INVESTMENTS IN EACH OF THE COMMON/COLLECTIVE TRUST FUNDS AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES ARE FURTHER DIVERSIFIED INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, ASSETS HELD BY THE FIRM’S U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY STOCK-INDEX FUNDS. THE PLANS HOLD INVESTMENTS IN FUNDS THAT ARE SPONSORED OR MANAGED BY AFFILIATES OF JPMORGAN CHASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

$1.8 BILLION

AND

$1.6 BILLION

FOR U.S. PLANS AND

$220 MILLION

AND

$194 MILLION

FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE FAIR VALUES OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31 FOR THE YEARS INDICATED, AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE APPROVED RANGE/TARGET ALLOCATION BY ASSET CATEGORY, FOR THE FIRM’S U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS.

NOTE 10 – EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH WAS LAST AMENDED IN MAY 2011 (“LTIP”). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LTIP, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

283 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH MAY 2015. THE LTIP IS THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS. IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, THE LTIP, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND PLANS ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE “LTI PLANS,” AND SUCH PLANS CONSTITUTE THE FIRM’S STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (“RSUS”) ARE AWARDED AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT UPON THEIR GRANT. RSUS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED ANNUALLY AND GENERALLY VEST AT A RATE OF 50% AFTER

TWO YEARS

AND 50% AFTER

THREE YEARS

AND CONVERT INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE VESTING DATE. IN ADDITION, RSUS TYPICALLY INCLUDE FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS, WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO VEST UPON VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, SUBJECT TO POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS BASED ON AGE OR SERVICE-RELATED REQUIREMENTS. ALL OF THESE AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL VESTED AND CONTAIN CLAWBACK PROVISIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN CANCELLATION PRIOR TO VESTING UNDER CERTAIN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. RSUS ENTITLE THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSUS ARE OUTSTANDING AND, AS SUCH, ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24 ON PAGE

301

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (“SARS”) HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE. THE FIRM TYPICALLY AWARDS SARS TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES ONCE PER YEAR; THE FIRM ALSO PERIODICALLY GRANTS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES. THE 2012, 2011 AND 2010 GRANTS OF SARS TO KEY EMPLOYEES VEST RATABLY OVER

FIVE YEARS

(I.E., 20% PER YEAR) AND CONTAIN CLAWBACK PROVISIONS SIMILAR TO RSUS. THE

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

GRANTS OF SARS CONTAIN FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS. SARS GENERALLY EXPIRE

TEN YEARS

AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

THE FIRM SEPARATELY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EACH TRANCHE OF EACH AWARD AS IF IT WERE A SEPARATE AWARD WITH ITS OWN VESTING DATE. GENERALLY, FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE, PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR AWARDS WITH FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY PROVISIONS AND AWARDS GRANTED WITH NO FUTURE SUBSTANTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENT, THE FIRM ACCRUES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES AS OF THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. FOR EACH TRANCHE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BECOME FULL-CAREER ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FROM THE GRANT DATE UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE EMPLOYEE’S FULL-CAREER ELIGIBILITY DATE OR THE VESTING DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANCHE.

THE FIRM’S POLICY FOR ISSUING SHARES UPON SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS IS TO ISSUE EITHER NEW SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR TREASURY SHARES. DURING

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, THE FIRM SETTLED ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS BY ISSUING TREASURY SHARES.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE FIRM AWARDED TO ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER UP TO

2 MILLION

SARS. THE TERMS OF THIS AWARD ARE DISTINCT FROM, AND MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN, OTHER EQUITY GRANTS REGULARLY AWARDED BY THE FIRM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2013, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT, WHILE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR VESTING OF THESE AWARDS HAVE BEEN MET, VESTING SHOULD BE DEFERRED FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO

18 MONTHS

(I.E., UP TO JULY 22, 2014), TO ENABLE THE FIRM TO MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST THE FIRM’S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND PERFORMANCE GOALS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION RELATING TO THE CIO MATTER. THE SARS, WHICH HAVE A

10-YEAR

TERM, WILL BECOME EXERCISABLE NO EARLIER THAN JULY 22, 2014, AND HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$39.83

(THE PRICE OF JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT). VESTING WILL BE SUBJECT TO A BOARD DETERMINATION TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROGRESS AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS AS IT DEEMS RELEVANT. THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS AWARD IS DEPENDENT ON CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SARS THROUGH THE DATE AT WHICH THE AWARD IS FINALIZED, AND THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH WAS INITIALLY ASSUMED TO BE FIVE YEARS BUT, EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO

SIX AND ONE-HALF YEARS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 12 – SECURITIES

SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY CLASSIFIED AS AFS OR TRADING. SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGES

196–214

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE AFS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS HELD BY CIO IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE DEBT SECURITIES COMPRISING THE AFS PORTFOLIO WAS

AA+

(BASED UPON EXTERNAL RATINGS WHERE AVAILABLE, AND WHERE NOT AVAILABLE, BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL RATINGS WHICH CORRESPOND TO RATINGS AS DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S). AFS SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AFTER ANY APPLICABLE HEDGE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS). THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES GAINS/(LOSSES) ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

AFS DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF THE FIRM’S ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (“OTTI”). FOR MOST TYPES OF DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHEN THE FIRM DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY. FOR BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS THAT ARE RATED BELOW “AA” AT THEIR ACQUISITION, OR THAT CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRM WOULD NOT RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS RECORDED INVESTMENT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS AN OTTI TO HAVE OCCURRED WHEN THERE IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. FOR AFS EQUITY SECURITIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FIRM WILL NOT RECOVER ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

POTENTIAL OTTI IS CONSIDERED USING A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; ADVERSE CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY, GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER OR UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF A SECURITY; PAYMENT STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY; CHANGES TO THE RATING OF THE SECURITY BY A RATING AGENCY; THE VOLATILITY OF THE FAIR VALUE CHANGES; AND THE FIRM’S INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY UNTIL RECOVERY.

FOR DEBT SECURITIES, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES OTTI LOSSES IN EARNINGS IF THE FIRM HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY, OR IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FIRM WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES. WHEN THE FIRM HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD AFS DEBT SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION, IT EVALUATES THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS TO BE RECEIVED AND DETERMINES IF A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IN THE EVENT OF A CREDIT LOSS, ONLY THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME.

AMOUNTS RELATING TO FACTORS OTHER THAN CREDIT LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN OCI.

THE FIRM’S CASH FLOW EVALUATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND EXPECTATIONS OF RELEVANT MARKET AND ECONOMIC DATA AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. FOR SECURITIES ISSUED IN A SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM ESTIMATES CASH FLOWS CONSIDERING UNDERLYING LOAN-LEVEL DATA AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE SECURITIZATION, SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, EXCESS SPREAD, OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, AND COMPARES THE LOSSES PROJECTED FOR THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (“POOL LOSSES”) AGAINST THE LEVEL OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THE POOL LOSSES, OR WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. THE FIRM ALSO PERFORMS OTHER ANALYSES TO SUPPORT ITS CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, SUCH AS FIRST-LOSS ANALYSES OR STRESS SCENARIOS.

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OTTI LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IF THE FIRM INTENDS TO SELL THE SECURITY. IN OTHER CASES THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELEVANT FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS THE FIRM’S INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE, AND WHETHER EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT A REALIZABLE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON AN EQUITY SECURITY IS EQUAL TO THE FULL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 13 – SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, “SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS”) PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRM’S INVENTORY POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS, ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS’ FINANCING NEEDS, AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS.

SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THE SECURITIES WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR RECEIVED. WHERE APPROPRIATE UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS. FEES RECEIVED AND PAID IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FIRM HAS ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, SEE NOTE 4 ON PAGES

214–216

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE SECURITIES FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED ARE REPORTED WITHIN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS; SECURITIES LOANED OR SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS; AND SECURITIES BORROWED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, FOR AGREEMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, CURRENT-PERIOD INTEREST ACCRUALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ANY INTEREST ELEMENTS, ARE REPORTED IN PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS REVENUE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AGREEMENTS IN EFFECT THAT MEET THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS FOR NET PRESENTATION UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE’S POLICY IS TO TAKE POSSESSION, WHERE POSSIBLE, OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND OF SECURITIES BORROWED. THE FIRM MONITORS THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES (PRIMARILY G7 GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES AND AGENCY MBS, AND EQUITIES) THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES AND EITHER REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR RETURNS A PORTION OF THE COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES. MARGIN LEVELS ARE ESTABLISHED INITIALLY BASED UPON THE COUNTERPARTY AND TYPE OF COLLATERAL AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO PROTECT AGAINST DECLINES IN COLLATERAL VALUE IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. JPMORGAN CHASE TYPICALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS RESALE AGREEMENT AND SECURITIES BORROWED COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE THE PURCHASED OR BORROWED SECURITIES IN THE EVENT OF A CUSTOMER DEFAULT. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO RESALE AND SECURITIES BORROWED AGREEMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD ANY RESERVES FOR CREDIT IMPAIRMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 – LOANS

LOAN ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK

THE ACCOUNTING FOR A LOAN DEPENDS ON MANAGEMENT’S STRATEGY FOR THE LOAN, AND ON WHETHER THE LOAN WAS CREDIT-IMPAIRED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR LOANS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

•

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (I.E., “RETAINED”), OTHER THAN PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (“PCI”) LOANS

•

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

•

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

•

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES A DETAILED ACCOUNTING DISCUSSION OF THESE LOAN CATEGORIES.

LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT (OTHER THAN PCI LOANS)

ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, ARE MEASURED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE FOLLOWING: ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; NET CHARGE-OFFS; INTEREST APPLIED TO PRINCIPAL (FOR LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE COST RECOVERY METHOD); UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS; AND NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS.

INTEREST INCOME

INTEREST INCOME ON PERFORMING LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, OTHER THAN PCI LOANS, IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST. PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS, AS WELL AS NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES OR COSTS, ARE AMORTIZED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN TO PRODUCE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. LOANS (OTHER THAN CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS INSURED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CONSIDERED NONPERFORMING WHEN FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, WHICH FOR CONSUMER LOANS, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, IS GENERALLY DETERMINED WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS

90 DAYS

OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE PAST DUE WHEN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED FROM THE BORROWER BY THE CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED DUE DATE OR FOR CERTAIN LOANS (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS), WHEN A MONTHLY PAYMENT IS DUE AND UNPAID FOR

30 DAYS

OR MORE. CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, LOANS THAT ARE LESS THAN

90 DAYS

PAST DUE MAY BE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS IN DOUBT (E.G., PERFORMING JUNIOR LIENS THAT ARE SUBORDINATE TO NONPERFORMING SENIOR LIENS). FINALLY, COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE TYPICALLY MAINTAINED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS.

ON THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALL INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED IS REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS IS SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED (I.E., ON A CASH BASIS) IF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE IS DEEMED FULLY COLLECTIBLE; HOWEVER, IF THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE RECORDED LOAN BALANCE, ALL INTEREST CASH RECEIPTS ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOAN (THE COST RECOVERY METHOD). FOR CONSUMER LOANS, APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY TYPICALLY RESULTS IN THE FIRM RECOGNIZING INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL CONSUMER LOANS ON A CASH BASIS.

A LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN REPAYMENT IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND THERE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN.

AS PERMITTED BY REGULATORY GUIDANCE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM BEING PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS; ACCORDINGLY, INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. HOWEVER, THE FIRM SEPARATELY ESTABLISHES AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PORTION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEE INCOME ON CREDIT CARD LOANS. THE ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WITH A CHARGE TO INTEREST INCOME AND IS REPORTED AS AN OFFSET TO LOANS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABLE LOSSES ON HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT LOANS. CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE FIRM’S ACCOUNTING POLICES FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

CHARGE-OFFS

CONSUMER LOANS, OTHER THAN RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING, RISK-RATED AUTO AND PCI LOANS, ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF OR CHARGED DOWN TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL (I.E., FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL), WITH AN OFFSET TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, UPON REACHING SPECIFIED STAGES OF DELINQUENCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (“FFIEC”). RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, NON-MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF AT

180 DAYS

PAST DUE. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2012

, THE FIRM REVISED ITS POLICY TO CHARGE-OFF MODIFIED CREDIT CARD LOANS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH THEIR MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS AT

120 DAYS

PAST DUE RATHER THAN

180 DAYS

PAST DUE. AUTO AND STUDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF NO LATER THAN

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS WILL BE CHARGED OFF EARLIER THAN THE FFIEC CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOLLOWS.

•

A CHARGE-OFF IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A LOAN IS MODIFIED IN A TDR IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. A LOAN IS CONSIDERED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT WHEN REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN IS EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED SOLELY BY THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, RATHER THAN BY CASH FLOWS FROM THE BORROWER’S OPERATIONS, INCOME OR OTHER RESOURCES.

•

LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED AN EVENT (E.G., BANKRUPTCY) THAT SUGGESTS A LOSS IS EITHER KNOWN OR HIGHLY CERTAIN ARE SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

60 DAYS

PAST DUE, OR SOONER IF THE LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. CREDIT CARD AND SCORED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WITHIN

60 DAYS

OF RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OR OTHER EVENT. STUDENT LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

60 DAYS

PAST DUE AFTER RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF A BANKRUPTCY.

•

AUTO LOANS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE UPON REPOSSESSION OF THE AUTOMOBILE AND AFTER A REDEMPTION PERIOD (I.E., THE PERIOD DURING WHICH A BORROWER MAY CURE THE LOAN) HAS PASSED.

OTHER THAN IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM TYPICALLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGE-OFFS ON GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS, RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND RISK-RATED AUTO LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN REALIZED, INCLUDING SITUATIONS WHERE A LOAN IS DETERMINED TO BE BOTH IMPAIRED AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE A CHARGE-OFF INCLUDES MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE FIRM’S CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY, EXPECTATIONS OF THE WORKOUT/RESTRUCTURING OF THE LOAN AND VALUATION OF THE BORROWER’S EQUITY OR THE LOAN COLLATERAL.

WHEN A LOAN IS CHARGED DOWN TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF COLLATERAL (E.G., SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE). IN CASES WHERE THE COLLATERAL IS IN THE FORM OF LIQUID SECURITIES, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR BROKER QUOTES. FOR ILLIQUID SECURITIES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL.

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE BASED UPON EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. WHEN IT BECOMES LIKELY THAT A BORROWER IS EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY, THE FIRM OBTAINS A BROKER’S PRICE OPINION OF THE HOME BASED ON AN EXTERIOR-ONLY VALUATION (“EXTERIOR OPINIONS”), WHICH IS THEN UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY

SIX MONTHS

THEREAFTER. AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE FIRM RECEIVES THE PROPERTY IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION), GENERALLY, EITHER THROUGH FORECLOSURE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER, THE FIRM OBTAINS AN APPRAISAL BASED ON AN INSPECTION THAT INCLUDES THE INTERIOR OF THE HOME (“INTERIOR APPRAISALS”). EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS ARE DISCOUNTED BASED UPON THE FIRM’S EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL LIQUIDATION VALUES AS COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATED VALUES PROVIDED BY EXTERIOR OPINIONS AND INTERIOR APPRAISALS, CONSIDERING STATE- AND PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTORS.

FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, COLLATERAL VALUES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON APPRAISALS FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALUATION SOURCES. COLLATERAL VALUES ARE TYPICALLY UPDATED EVERY

SIX

TO

TWELVE MONTHS

, EITHER BY OBTAINING A NEW APPRAISAL OR BY PERFORMING AN INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S POLICIES. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS BOTH BORROWER- AND MARKET-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN OBTAINING APPRAISAL UPDATES OR BROKER PRICE OPINIONS AT MORE FREQUENT INTERVALS.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. FOR CONSUMER LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS, THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED ON AN INDIVIDUAL LOAN BASIS.

INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL RATE OF INTEREST.

LOAN ORIGINATION FEES OR COSTS AND PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE DEFERRED IN A CONTRA LOAN ACCOUNT UNTIL THE RELATED LOAN IS SOLD. THE DEFERRED FEES AND DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS ARE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASIS OF THE LOAN AND THEREFORE ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIODIC DETERMINATION OF THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND/OR THE GAIN OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NONACCRUAL POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

BECAUSE HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOANS AT FAIR VALUE

LOANS USED IN A MARKET-MAKING STRATEGY OR RISK MANAGED ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

FOR THESE LOANS, THE EARNED CURRENT CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAYMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST INCOME. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED UPFRONT IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE CATEGORY AS INCURRED.

BECAUSE THESE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE, THE FIRM’S NONACCRUAL, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES DO NOT APPLY TO THESE LOANS.

196–214

AND

214–216

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON LOANS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

PCI LOANS

PCI LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. PCI LOANS HAVE EVIDENCE OF CREDIT DETERIORATION SINCE THE LOAN’S ORIGINATION DATE AND THEREFORE IT IS PROBABLE, AT ACQUISITION, THAT ALL CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE COLLECTED. BECAUSE PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES, NO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO PCI LOANS IS RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. SEE PAGE

266

OF THIS NOTE FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING FOR PCI LOANS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR ACQUISITION.

LOAN CLASSIFICATION CHANGES

LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO SELL ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES; LOSSES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

IN THE EVENT THAT MANAGEMENT DECIDES TO RETAIN A LOAN IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO, THE LOAN IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF TRANSFER. THESE LOANS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE FIRM’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

THE FIRM SEEKS TO MODIFY CERTAIN LOANS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS LOSS-MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THE MODIFICATION,

JPMORGAN CHASE

GRANTS ONE OR MORE CONCESSIONS TO A BORROWER WHO IS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE FIRM’S ECONOMIC LOSS, AVOID FORECLOSURE OR REPOSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL, AND TO ULTIMATELY MAXIMIZE PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE FIRM FROM THE BORROWER. THE CONCESSIONS GRANTED VARY BY PROGRAM AND BY BORROWER-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND MAY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS, TERM EXTENSIONS, PAYMENT DEFERRALS, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS, OR THE ACCEPTANCE OF EQUITY OR OTHER ASSETS IN LIEU OF PAYMENTS.

SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (“TDRS”). A LOAN THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED UNTIL IT MATURES, IS REPAID, OR IS OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BORROWER PERFORMS UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED CASES, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE MODIFIED LOAN IS AT OR ABOVE THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AT THE TIME OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ASSUMING THAT THE LOAN SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMS UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS AND THE FIRM EXPECTS TO COLLECT ALL CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH FLOWS, THE LOAN IS DISCLOSED AS IMPAIRED AND AS A TDR ONLY DURING THE YEAR OF THE MODIFICATION; IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, THE LOAN IS NOT DISCLOSED AS AN IMPAIRED LOAN OR AS A TDR SO LONG AS REPAYMENT OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOAN UNDER ITS MODIFIED TERMS IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

LOANS, EXCEPT FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS, MODIFIED IN A TDR ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES SUCH LOANS WERE ALREADY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS PRIOR TO MODIFICATION. THESE LOANS MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS (THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS RESUMED) IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: (A) THE BORROWER HAS PERFORMED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS FOR A MINIMUM OF

SIX MONTHS

AND/OR

SIX

PAYMENTS, AND (B) THE FIRM HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE MODIFIED LOAN IS REASONABLY ASSURED BASED ON, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BORROWER’S DEBT CAPACITY AND LEVEL OF FUTURE EARNINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES, LTV RATIOS, AND OTHER CURRENT MARKET CONSIDERATIONS. IN CERTAIN LIMITED AND WELL-DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE LOAN IS CURRENT AT THE MODIFICATION DATE, SUCH LOANS ARE NOT PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AT THE TIME OF MODIFICATION.

BECAUSE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THESE LOANS ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING THE FIRM’S ESTABLISHED ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY, WHICH CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED RE-DEFAULT RATES FOR THE MODIFIED LOANS. A LOAN MODIFIED IN A TDR REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY THROUGHOUT ITS REMAINING LIFE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOAN IS PERFORMING AND HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

FORECLOSED PROPERTY

THE FIRM ACQUIRES PROPERTY FROM BORROWERS THROUGH LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS, WORKOUTS, AND FORECLOSURES. PROPERTY ACQUIRED MAY INCLUDE REAL PROPERTY (E.G., RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, LAND, BUILDINGS, AND FIXTURES) AND COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (E.G., AIRCRAFT, RAILCARS, AND SHIPS).

THE FIRM RECOGNIZES FORECLOSED PROPERTY UPON RECEIVING ASSETS IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT (E.G., BY TAKING LEGAL TITLE OR PHYSICAL POSSESSION). FOR LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL PROPERTY, THE FIRM GENERALLY RECOGNIZES THE ASSET RECEIVED AT FORECLOSURE SALE OR UPON THE EXECUTION OF A DEED IN LIEU OF

FORECLOSURE TRANSACTION WITH THE BORROWER. FORECLOSED ASSETS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND INITIALLY RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. EACH QUARTER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS REVIEWED AND ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO FAIR VALUE ARE CHARGED/CREDITED TO NONINTEREST REVENUE. OPERATING EXPENSE, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE TAXES AND MAINTENANCE, ARE CHARGED TO OTHER EXPENSE.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE THE SAME SEGMENTS USED BY THE FIRM TO DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD; CREDIT CARD; AND WHOLESALE. WITHIN EACH PORTFOLIO SEGMENT, THE FIRM MONITORS AND ASSESSES THE CREDIT RISK IN THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF LOANS, BASED ON THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH LOAN CLASS.

DELINQUENCY RATES ARE A PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CONSUMER LOANS. LOANS THAT ARE MORE THAN

30 DAYS

PAST DUE PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING OF BORROWERS WHO MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND/OR WHO MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO REPAY THE LOAN. AS THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE, IT BECOMES MORE CLEAR THAT THE BORROWER IS LIKELY EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. IN THE CASE OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, LATE-STAGE DELINQUENCIES (GREATER THAN

150 DAYS

PAST DUE) ARE A STRONG INDICATOR OF LOANS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A FORECLOSURE OR SIMILAR LIQUIDATION TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, OTHER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS FOR CONSUMER LOANS VARY BASED ON THE CLASS OF LOAN, AS FOLLOWS.

•

FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, INCLUDING BOTH NON-PCI AND PCI PORTFOLIOS, THE CURRENT ESTIMATED LTV RATIO, OR THE COMBINED LTV RATIO IN THE CASE OF JUNIOR LIEN LOANS, IS AN INDICATOR OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS SEVERITY IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, LTV OR COMBINED LTV CAN PROVIDE

INSIGHT INTO A BORROWER’S CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO PAY, AS THE DELINQUENCY RATE OF HIGH-LTV LOANS TENDS TO BE GREATER THAN THAT FOR LOANS WHERE THE BORROWER HAS EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOAN COLLATERAL ALSO PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO, AS FACTORS SUCH AS THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, HOME PRICE CHANGES AND SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS, WILL AFFECT CREDIT QUALITY. THE BORROWER’S CURRENT OR “REFRESHED” FICO SCORE IS A SECONDARY CREDIT-QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CERTAIN LOANS, AS FICO SCORES ARE AN INDICATION OF THE BORROWER’S CREDIT PAYMENT HISTORY. THUS, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A LOW FICO SCORE (

660

OR BELOW) IS CONSIDERED TO BE OF HIGHER RISK THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH FICO SCORE. FURTHER, A LOAN TO A BORROWER WITH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A LOW FICO SCORE IS AT GREATER RISK OF DEFAULT THAN A LOAN TO A BORROWER THAT HAS BOTH A HIGH LTV RATIO AND A HIGH FICO SCORE.

•

FOR SCORED AUTO, SCORED BUSINESS BANKING AND STUDENT LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION IS AN INDICATOR OF THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SIMILAR TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE BASED ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND EVENTS.

•

RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING AND AUTO LOANS ARE SIMILAR TO WHOLESALE LOANS IN THAT THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS ARE THE RISK RATING THAT IS ASSIGNED TO THE LOAN AND WHETHER THE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICIZED AND/OR NONACCRUAL. RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT BORROWERS’ ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT RISK-RATED WHOLESALE LOAN CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS, SEE PAGE

OF THIS NOTE.

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING PCI LOANS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION BY CLASS FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING RETAINED PCI LOANS IN THE CONSUMER, EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ANALYZING CERTAIN CREDIT STATISTICS APPLICABLE TO THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE – EXCLUDING PCI LOANS PORTFOLIO: (I) JUNIOR LIEN HOME EQUITY LOANS MAY BE FULLY CHARGED OFF WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES

180 DAYS

PAST DUE, AND THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN, RESULTING IN RELATIVELY HIGH CHARGE-OFF RATES FOR THIS PRODUCT CLASS; AND (II) THE LENGTHENING OF LOSS-MITIGATION TIMELINES MAY RESULT IN HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES FOR LOANS CARRIED AT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL THAT REMAIN ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

-YEAR PERIOD, AFTER WHICH TIME THE HELOC CONVERTS TO A LOAN WITH A

20

-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD, BUT ALSO INCLUDE HELOCS ORIGINATED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL THAT REQUIRE INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS BEYOND THE REVOLVING PERIOD.

(B) THE FIRM MANAGES THE RISK OF HELOCS DURING THEIR REVOLVING PERIOD BY CLOSING OR REDUCING THE UNDRAWN LINE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WHEN BORROWERS ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY OR WHEN THE COLLATERAL DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOAN AMOUNT.

HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (“HELOCS”) WITHIN THE REQUIRED AMORTIZATION PERIOD AND HOME EQUITY LOANS (“HELOANS”) HAVE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES THAN DO HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THAT IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE FULLY-AMORTIZING PAYMENT REQUIRED FOR THOSE PRODUCTS IS HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR HELOCS WITHIN THE REVOLVING PERIOD. THE HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES ASSOCIATED WITH AMORTIZING HELOCS AND HELOANS ARE FACTORED INTO THE LOSS ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THE FIRM’S DELINQUENCY ROLL-RATE METHODOLOGY, WHICH ESTIMATES DEFAULTS BASED ON THE CURRENT DELINQUENCY STATUS OF A PORTFOLIO.

IMPAIRED LOANS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM REPORTED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY GUIDANCE,

$1.6 BILLION

OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED UNDER CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY AND NOT REAFFIRMED BY THE BORROWER (“CHAPTER 7 LOANS”) AS COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT NONACCRUAL TDRS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DELINQUENCY STATUS. PURSUANT TO THAT GUIDANCE, THESE CHAPTER 7 LOANS WERE CHARGED OFF TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, RESULTING IN

$747 MILLION

OF CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT RESTATED FOR THIS POLICY CHANGE. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, THE FIRM’S POLICY WAS TO CHARGE DOWN TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE, AND ALSO TO PLACE ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, LOANS TO BORROWERS WHO HAD FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY WHEN SUCH LOANS BECAME

60 DAYS

PAST DUE; HOWEVER, THE FIRM DID NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORT CHAPTER 7 LOANS AS TDRS UNLESS OTHERWISE MODIFIED UNDER ONE OF THE FIRM’S LOSS MITIGATION PROGRAMS.

THE TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRM’S RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE IMPAIRED LOANS, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS. THESE LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED AS THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN A TDR. ALL IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED FOR AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 ON PAGES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 5, 2012, REQUIRED THE FIRM TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION

OF REFINANCING RELIEF TO CERTAIN “UNDERWATER” BORROWERS UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM AND APPROXIMATELY

$3.7 BILLION

OF ADDITIONAL RELIEF TO CERTAIN BORROWERS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS OF PRINCIPAL ON FIRST AND SECOND LIENS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE REFI PROGRAM WAS TO ALLOW ELIGIBLE BORROWERS WHO WERE CURRENT ON THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS TO REFINANCE THEIR EXISTING LOANS; SUCH BORROWERS WERE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY HAD NO EQUITY OR, IN MANY CASES, NEGATIVE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM, THE INTEREST RATE ON EACH REFINANCED LOAN COULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED EITHER FOR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LOAN OR FOR FIVE YEARS. THE FIRM REDUCED THE INTEREST RATES ON LOANS THAT IT REFINANCED UNDER THE REFI PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINING LIVES OF THOSE LOANS. THE REFINANCINGS GENERALLY DID NOT RESULT IN TERM EXTENSIONS AND ACCORDINGLY, IN THAT

REGARD, WERE MORE SIMILAR TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS THAN TO TRADITIONAL REFINANCINGS.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MODIFY FIRST AND SECOND LIEN LOANS UNDER THE CONSUMER RELIEF PROGRAM. THESE LOAN MODIFICATIONS ARE PRIMARILY EXPECTED TO BE EXECUTED UNDER THE TERMS OF EITHER THE U.S. TREASURY’S MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE (“MHA”) PROGRAMS (E.G., THE HOME AFFORDABLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“HAMP”), THE SECOND LIEN MODIFICATION PROGRAM (“2MP”)) OR ONE OF THE FIRM’S PROPRIETARY MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, SEE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT ON SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES IN NOTE 2 ON PAGE

MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS, ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS TDRS. THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND TO BORROWERS WHOSE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, EXCLUDING PCI LOANS, HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS.

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF MODIFICATIONS AND REDEFAULTS

FOR AUTO LOANS, TDRS TYPICALLY OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE BORROWER. IN THESE CASES, THE LOAN IS MODIFIED WITH A REVISED REPAYMENT PLAN THAT TYPICALLY INCORPORATES INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PRINCIPAL FORGIVENESS. BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, CHAPTER 7 AUTO LOANS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TDRS.

FOR BUSINESS BANKING LOANS, CONCESSIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON INDIVIDUAL BORROWER CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAN BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE FOR BORROWERS WHO NEED TEMPORARY RELIEF OR LONGER TERM FOR BORROWERS EXPERIENCING MORE FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. CONCESSIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY TERM OR PAYMENT EXTENSIONS, BUT ALSO MAY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS.

TWO

PAYMENTS PAST DUE; AND (2) FOR RISK-RATED BUSINESS BANKING LOANS AND AUTO LOANS, WHEN THE BORROWER HAS NOT MADE A LOAN PAYMENT BY ITS SCHEDULED DUE DATE AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONTRACTUAL GRACE PERIOD, IF ANY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS

PCI LOANS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT ACQUISITION; PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE SAME FISCAL QUARTER MAY BE AGGREGATED INTO ONE OR MORE POOLS, PROVIDED THAT THE LOANS HAVE COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS. A POOL IS THEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE ASSET WITH A SINGLE COMPOSITE INTEREST RATE AND AN AGGREGATE EXPECTATION OF CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION, ALL OF THE CONSUMER LOANS WERE AGGREGATED INTO POOLS OF LOANS WITH COMMON RISK CHARACTERISTICS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS (BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST) EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF EACH POOL. THESE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT REFLECT THEN-CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. PROBABLE DECREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (I.E., INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES) TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT, WHICH IS THEN MEASURED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL LOSS PLUS ANY RELATED FOREGONE INTEREST CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED AT THE POOL’S EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS (E.G., DECREASED CREDIT LOSSES, THE NET BENEFIT OF MODIFICATIONS) WOULD FIRST REVERSE ANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WITH ANY REMAINING INCREASES RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS. THE IMPACTS OF (I) PREPAYMENTS, (II) CHANGES IN VARIABLE INTEREST RATES, AND (III) ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ARE RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST INCOME. DISPOSALS OF LOANS — WHICH MAY INCLUDE SALES OF LOANS, RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS IN FULL BY THE BORROWER, OR FORECLOSURE — RESULT IN REMOVAL OF THE LOANS FROM THE PCI PORTFOLIO.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO MODIFY CERTAIN PCI LOANS. THE IMPACT OF THESE MODIFICATIONS IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A PROBABLE AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS HAS OCCURRED, AND THE LOANS CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED AS PCI LOANS. IN EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF MODIFICATIONS ON EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, THE FIRM INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF ANY FOREGONE INTEREST AND ALSO CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT. THE FIRM DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE USED TO COMPUTE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED PCI MODIFIED LOANS.

THE EXCESS OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED OVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS IS REFERRED TO AS THE ACCRETABLE YIELD. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT REPORTED ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BUT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME AT A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF LOANS.

IF THE TIMING AND/OR AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON PCI LOANS WERE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, NO INTEREST WOULD BE ACCRETED AND THE LOANS WOULD BE REPORTED AS NONACCRUAL LOANS; HOWEVER, SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRM’S PCI CONSUMER LOANS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, INTEREST IS BEING ACCRETED AND THE LOANS ARE BEING REPORTED AS PERFORMING LOANS.

CHARGE-OFFS ARE NOT RECORDED ON PCI LOANS UNTIL ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED THE ESTIMATED LOSSES THAT WERE RECORDED AS PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AT ACQUISITION DATE. ACTUAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE PCI ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. TO DATE, NO CHARGE-OFFS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE CONSUMER LOANS.

THE PCI PORTFOLIO AFFECTS THE FIRM’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH: (I) CONTRIBUTION TO NET INTEREST MARGIN; (II) EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFAULTS AND SERVICING RESULTING FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF THE LOANS; AND (III) ANY PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. THE PCI LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION WERE FUNDED BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOANS. FOR EXAMPLE, VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH VARIABLE-RATE LIABILITIES AND FIXED-RATE LOANS WERE FUNDED WITH FIXED-RATE LIABILITIES WITH A SIMILAR MATURITY PROFILE. A NET SPREAD WILL BE EARNED ON THE DECLINING BALANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, TO HAVE A REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF

8

YEARS.

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WERE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF MODIFICATIONS, BUT ALSO RELATED TO CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010

, OTHER CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS WERE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS RECLASSIFICATION TO THE NONACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE. CHANGES TO PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE THE EXPECTED REMAINING LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO, WHICH DRIVES CHANGES IN EXPECTED FUTURE INTEREST CASH COLLECTIONS. SUCH CHANGES DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE.

THE FACTORS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ESTIMATES OF GROSS CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, AND ACCORDINGLY THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE, INCLUDE: (I) CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE INDICES FOR VARIABLE-RATE PRODUCTS SUCH AS OPTION ARM AND HOME EQUITY LOANS; AND (II) CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS.

FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION THROUGH 2011, THE DECREASE IN THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE-RATE LOANS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS. MORE RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE FIRM HAS OBSERVED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS START TO SHORTEN, THUS INCREASING THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE. CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS EXTENDED OR SHORTENED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS, AFFECT THE TIMING OF

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS AND THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE, BUT NOT THE AMOUNT OF CASH EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED (I.E., THE ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE). WHILE EXTENDED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS REDUCE THE ACCRETABLE YIELD PERCENTAGE (BECAUSE THE SAME ACCRETABLE YIELD BALANCE IS RECOGNIZED AGAINST A HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOAN BALANCE OVER A LONGER-THAN-EXPECTED PERIOD OF TIME), SHORTENED LOAN LIQUIDATION PERIODS WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT CARD LOAN PORTFOLIO

THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SEGMENT INCLUDES CREDIT CARD LOANS ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED BY THE FIRM. DELINQUENCY RATES ARE THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS AS THEY PROVIDE AN EARLY WARNING THAT BORROWERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES (

30 DAYS

PAST DUE), AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON THOSE BORROWERS THAT HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME (

90 DAYS

PAST DUE). IN ADDITION TO DELINQUENCY RATES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOANS PROVIDES INSIGHT AS TO THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO BASED ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY.

WHILE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE IS ANOTHER GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY, BECAUSE THE BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE TENDS TO BE A LAGGING INDICATOR, THE FIRM DOES NOT VIEW CREDIT SCORES AS A PRIMARY INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY. HOWEVER, THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SCORES PROVIDES A GENERAL INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. REFRESHED FICO SCORE INFORMATION FOR A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO IS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW; FICO IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE INDUSTRY BENCHMARK FOR CREDIT SCORES.

THE FIRM GENERALLY ORIGINATES NEW CARD ACCOUNTS TO PRIME CONSUMER BORROWERS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CARDHOLDERS’ FICO SCORES MAY DECREASE OVER TIME, DEPENDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CARDHOLDER AND CHANGES IN CREDIT SCORE TECHNOLOGY.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY OFFER ONE OF A NUMBER OF LOAN MODIFICATION PROGRAMS TO CREDIT CARD BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. THE FIRM HAS SHORT-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO MAY BE IN NEED OF TEMPORARY RELIEF, AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS FOR BORROWERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MORE FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. MOST OF THE CREDIT CARD LOANS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS. MODIFICATIONS UNDER LONG-TERM PROGRAMS INVOLVE PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN, GENERALLY FOR

60 MONTHS

. MODIFICATIONS UNDER ALL SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS TYPICALLY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT CARD. CERTAIN BORROWERS ENROLLED IN A SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAM MAY BE GIVEN THE OPTION TO RE-ENROLL IN A LONG-TERM PROGRAM. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE TDRS. IF THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED PAYMENT TERMS, THEN THE CREDIT CARD LOAN AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. ASSUMING THAT THE CARDHOLDER DOES NOT BEGIN TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PAYMENT TERMS, THE LOAN CONTINUES TO AGE AND WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHARGED-OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRM’S STANDARD CHARGE-OFF POLICY. IN ADDITION, IF A BORROWER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A SHORT-TERM

MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THEN THE LOAN REVERTS BACK TO ITS PRE-MODIFICATION PAYMENT TERMS. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT REINSTATE THE BORROWER’S LINE OF CREDIT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO

WHOLESALE LOANS INCLUDE LOANS MADE TO A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, RANGING FROM LARGE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.

THE PRIMARY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR FOR WHOLESALE LOANS IS THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED EACH LOAN. RISK RATINGS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE CREDIT QUALITY OF LOANS AND DIFFERENTIATE RISK WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. RISK RATINGS ON LOANS CONSIDER THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT (“PD”) AND THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT (“LGD”). PD IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LOAN WILL NOT BE REPAID AT DEFAULT. THE LGD IS THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON THE LOAN THAT WOULD BE REALIZED UPON THE DEFAULT OF THE BORROWER AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE RISK RATING, INCLUDING THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, THE FIRM REVISED ITS DEFINITION OF THE CRITICIZED COMPONENT OF THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO TO ALIGN WITH THE BANKING REGULATORS’ DEFINITION OF CRITICIZED EXPOSURES, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE SPECIAL MENTION, SUBSTANDARD AND DOUBTFUL CATEGORIES. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. RISK RATINGS GENERALLY REPRESENT RATINGS PROFILES SIMILAR TO THOSE DEFINED BY S&P AND MOODY’S. INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS RANGE FROM “AAA/AAA” TO “BBB-/BAA3.” NONINVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS NONCRITICIZED (“BB+/BA1 AND B-/B3”) AND CRITICIZED (“CCC+”/“CAA1 AND BELOW”), AND THE CRITICIZED PORTION IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO PERFORMING AND NONACCRUAL LOANS, REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CRITICIZED LOANS HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN NONCRITICIZED LOANS.

RISK RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR AND ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND ARE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE RISK RATING OF A LOAN CONSIDERS THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THE OVERALL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON THE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND CLIENT EXPOSURES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO INDUSTRIES WITH ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERN.

THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. DISTRIBUTION IS DETERMINED BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON THE DOMICILE OF THE BORROWER.

(B)

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF WHOLESALE LOANS IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW AND MONITORING OF AN OBLIGOR’S ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE PAST DUE STATUS, WHICH IS GENERALLY A LAGGING INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL ESTATE CLASS OF LOANS WITHIN THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO SEGMENT FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED. THE REAL ESTATE CLASS PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SECURED COMMERCIAL LOANS MAINLY TO BORROWERS FOR MULTI-FAMILY AND COMMERCIAL LESSOR PROPERTIES. MULTIFAMILY LENDING SPECIFICALLY FINANCES APARTMENT BUILDINGS. COMMERCIAL LESSORS RECEIVE FINANCING SPECIFICALLY FOR REAL ESTATE LEASED TO RETAIL, OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL TENANTS. COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT LOANS REPRESENT FINANCING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF APARTMENTS, OFFICE AND PROFESSIONAL BUILDINGS AND MALLS. OTHER REAL ESTATE LOANS INCLUDE LODGING, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (“REITS”), SINGLE-FAMILY, HOMEBUILDERS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE.

NOTE 15 – ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE CONSUMER, INCLUDING CREDIT CARD, PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS (PRIMARILY SCORED); AND WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) PORTFOLIO, AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRM’S LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT, A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT AND A COMPONENT RELATED TO PCI LOANS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTIMATES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS USING METHODOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE ON THE UNDERLYING LOANS. DURING

2012

, THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE METHODOLOGIES OR POLICIES USED TO DETERMINE ITS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES; SUCH POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE RELATES TO LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, WHICH INCLUDES LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS AS WELL AS RISK-RATED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS. TO DETERMINE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER LOANS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE SMALLER LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS POOLS USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS. SCORED LOANS (I.E., CONSUMER LOANS) ARE POOLED BY PRODUCT TYPE, WHILE RISK-RATED LOANS (PRIMARILY WHOLESALE LOANS) ARE SEGMENTED BY RISK RATING.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MEASURES THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED, DISCOUNTED AT THE LOAN’S ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN IMPAIRMENT ARE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED USING AN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE, AND THE ALLOWANCE IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN THE LOAN AND THE LOAN’S FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRED COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS ARE CHARGED DOWN TO THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL LESS COSTS TO SELL AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO AN ASSET-SPECIFIC RESERVE AS FOR OTHER IMPAIRED LOANS. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHARGE-OFFS AND COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN TDRS INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF FOREGONE INTEREST, IF ANY, IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION AND ALSO INCORPORATES THE EFFECT OF THE MODIFICATION ON THE LOAN’S EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEFAULT. FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, THE FIRM DEVELOPS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE APPLIED AT A LOAN LEVEL TO COMPUTE EXPECTED LOSSES. IN DEVELOPING THESE PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CREDIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AND CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOME PRICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, BASED UPON INDUSTRY-WIDE DATA. THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS ITS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE TO DATE BASED ON ACTUAL REDEFAULTED MODIFIED LOANS. FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE PROJECTED REDEFAULTS BASED ON THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE BY TYPE OF MODIFICATION PROGRAM. FOR WHOLESALE LOANS MODIFIED IN TDRS, EXPECTED LOSSES INCORPORATE REDEFAULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S EXPECTATION OF THE BORROWER’S ABILITY TO REPAY UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS BASED ON A STATISTICAL CALCULATION TO PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE PRINCIPAL LOSSES INHERENT IN PERFORMING RISK-RATED LOANS AND ALL CONSUMER LOANS, EXCEPT FOR ANY LOANS RESTRUCTURED IN TDRS AND PCI LOANS. SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

250–275

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PCI LOANS.

FOR SCORED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS PERFORMED ON POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., PRODUCT TYPE) AND GENERALLY COMPUTED BY APPLYING EXPECTED LOSS FACTORS TO OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OVER AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD. THE LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD REPRESENTS THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATE AT WHICH THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THAT LOSS (THROUGH A CHARGE-OFF). ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS MAY VARY BY PRODUCT AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME; MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING LOSS EMERGENCE PERIODS, USING AVAILABLE CREDIT INFORMATION AND TRENDS.

LOSS FACTORS ARE STATISTICALLY DERIVED AND SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT SCORES, COLLATERAL VALUES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. THE FIRM USES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORECASTING MODELS TO ESTIMATE BOTH THE PD AND THE LOSS SEVERITY, INCLUDING DELINQUENCY ROLL RATE MODELS AND CREDIT LOSS SEVERITY MODEL

S.

IN DEVELOPING PD AND LOSS SEVERITY ASSUMPTIONS, THE FIRM ALSO CONSIDERS KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HOME PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS.

276

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX MEASURE IS USED TO ESTIMATE BOTH THE PD AND THE LOSS SEVERITY ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AT THE METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (“MSA”) LEVEL. LOSS SEVERITY ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY VALIDATED BY COMPARISON TO ACTUAL LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON DEFAULTED LOANS, MARKET-SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS AND PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TYPE AND RESULTS OF SUCH MODIFICATIONS.

FOR RISK-RATED LOANS, THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF AN ESTIMATED PD AND AN ESTIMATED LGD. THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND EXPECTED MATURITY. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE OBLIGOR’S DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGOR’S EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH, AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT LOAN. PD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE EXTERNAL THROUGH-THE-CYCLE DATA, USING CREDIT-RATING AGENCY DEFAULT STATISTICS. LGD ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE FIRM’S HISTORY OF ACTUAL CREDIT LOSSES OVER MORE THAN ONE CREDIT CYCLE.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES JUDGMENT WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK TO ADJUST THE RESULTS OF APPLYING THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT THAT ARE NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS AND THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO. FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. FACTORS RELATED TO UNEMPLOYMENT, HOME PRICES, BORROWER BEHAVIOR AND LIEN POSITION

,

THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE-RELATED SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS AND UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF LOAN MODIFICATIONS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR JUNIOR LIEN PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE DELINQUENCY AND/OR MODIFICATION STATUS OF ANY SENIOR LIENS IN DETERMINING THE ADJUSTMENT. IN ADDITION, FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS, ANY ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ALSO CONSIDER CONCENTRATED AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES.

MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, IN LIGHT OF THE FACTORS THEN PREVAILING, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE CONTROLLER OF THE FIRM AND DISCUSSED WITH THE RISK POLICY AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E., SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO).

THE FIRM’S OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED WITH VIES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT, AS FOLLOWS.

•

ASSET MANAGEMENT: SPONSORS AND MANAGES CERTAIN FUNDS THAT ARE DEEMED VIES. AS ASSET MANAGER OF THE FUNDS, AM EARNS A FEE BASED ON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES WITH EACH FUND’S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR FUND ENTITIES THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AM’S INTERESTS ARE, IN CERTAIN CASES, CONSIDERED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTERESTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE ENTITIES.

•

COMMERCIAL BANKING: CB MAKES INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES LENDING TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES THAT MAY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A VIE. IN ADDITION, CB PROVIDES FINANCING AND LENDING RELATED SERVICES TO CERTAIN CLIENT-SPONSORED VIES. IN GENERAL, CB DOES NOT CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES.

•

CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY: CORPORATE USES VIES TO ISSUE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. SEE NOTE 21 ON PAGES

297–299

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, WITHIN CORPORATE/PRIVATE EQUITY, MAY BE INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT ARE DEEMED VIES. HOWEVER, THE FIRM’S PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SPECIALIZED INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATION OF INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VIES.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN AND PROVIDES FINANCING AND OTHER SERVICES TO VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

SIGNIFICANT FIRM-SPONSORED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS

THE CARD BUSINESS SECURITIZES ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED CREDIT CARD LOANS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE CHASE ISSUANCE TRUST (THE “TRUST”). THE FIRM’S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS INCLUDES SERVICING THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING AN UNDIVIDED SELLER’S INTEREST IN THE RECEIVABLES, RETAINING CERTAIN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED SECURITIES AND MAINTAINING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE FIRM IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THESE FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS BASED ON THE FIRM’S ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH ITS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER DUTIES, INCLUDING MAKING DECISIONS AS TO THE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE TRANSFERRED INTO THOSE TRUSTS AND AS TO ANY RELATED MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FIRM’S OTHER CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUSTS, AS INDICATED ABOVE, OBLIGATES THE FIRM TO ABSORB LOSSES AND GIVES THE FIRM THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THESE VIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

THE UNDERLYING SECURITIZED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR PAYMENT OF THE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS; THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE FIRM’S OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR THE CLAIMS OF THE FIRM’S OTHER CREDITORS.

THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS (WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM

4%

TO

12%

). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM HELD UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN FIRM-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OF

$15.8 BILLION

AND

$13.7 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL RECEIVABLES OWNED BY THOSE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY

28%

AND

22%

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM ALSO RETAINED

$362 MILLION

AND

$541 MILLION

OF SENIOR SECURITIES AND

$4.6 BILLION

AND

$3.0 BILLION

OF SUBORDINATED SECURITIES IN CERTAIN OF ITS CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM’S UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN THE CREDIT CARD TRUSTS AND SECURITIES RETAINED ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FIRM-SPONSORED MORTGAGE AND OTHER SECURITIZATION TRUSTS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES (OR HAS SECURITIZED) ORIGINATED AND PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS) PRIMARILY IN ITS CIB AND CCB BUSINESSES. DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS INVOLVED, THE FIRM MAY ACT AS THE SERVICER OF THE LOANS AND/OR RETAIN CERTAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

THE FIRM SECURITIZES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED BY CCB, AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES BY EITHER CCB OR CIB. CCB GENERALLY RETAINS SERVICING FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED OR PURCHASED BY CCB, AND FOR CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS PURCHASED BY CIB. FOR SECURITIZATIONS SERVICED BY CCB, THE FIRM HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE BECAUSE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATED TO LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND WORKOUTS. CCB MAY ALSO RETAIN AN INTEREST UPON SECURITIZATION.

IN ADDITION, CIB ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING SECURITIES ISSUED BY FIRM-SPONSORED SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. AS A RESULT, CIB AT TIMES RETAINS SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL INTERESTS) IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS UPON SECURITIZATION, AND/OR REACQUIRES POSITIONS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIONS RETAINED OR REACQUIRED BY CIB OR HELD BY CCB, WHEN CONSIDERED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY CCB, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF CERTAIN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION (FIRM-SPONSORED OR THIRD-PARTY-SPONSORED) WHEN IT IS NOT THE SERVICER (AND THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE TRUST) OR DOES NOT HOLD A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE TRUST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS OF CERTAIN FIRM-SPONSORED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION VIES, IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FIRM DID NOT HOLD AN INTEREST IN THESE TRUSTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE TRUSTS. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES AND OTHER CONSUMER SECURITIZATIONS

CIB ORIGINATES AND SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, AND ENGAGES IN UNDERWRITING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. CIB MAY RETAIN UNSOLD SENIOR AND/OR SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS AT THE TIME OF SECURITIZATION BUT, GENERALLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT SERVICE COMMERCIAL LOAN SECURITIZATIONS. FOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE GENERALLY IS HELD BY THE SERVICER OR INVESTORS IN A SPECIFIED CLASS OF SECURITIES (“CONTROLLING CLASS”). SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

THE FIRM ALSO SECURITIZES AUTOMOBILE AND STUDENT LOANS. THE FIRM RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL ORIGINATED AND CERTAIN PURCHASED STUDENT AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE VIES THROUGH THESE SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STUDENT LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE TABLE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

RE-SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM ENGAGES IN CERTAIN RE-SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH DEBT SECURITIES ARE TRANSFERRED TO A VIE IN EXCHANGE FOR NEW BENEFICIAL INTERESTS. THESE TRANSFERS OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH BOTH AGENCY (FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND GINNIE MAE) AND NONAGENCY (PRIVATE-LABEL) SPONSORED VIES, WHICH MAY BE BACKED BY EITHER RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES. THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE FIRM’S ROLE AND INTEREST IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUSTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, THE FIRM TRANSFERRED

$10.0 BILLION

,

$24.9 BILLION

AND

$33.9 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO AGENCY VIES, AND

$286 MILLION

,

$381 MILLION

AND

$1.3 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES TO PRIVATE-LABEL VIES.

MOST RE-SECURITIZATIONS WITH WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED ARE CLIENT-DRIVEN TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A SPECIFIC CLIENT OR GROUP OF CLIENTS ARE SEEKING A SPECIFIC RETURN OR RISK PROFILE. FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE DECISION-MAKING POWER OF THE ENTITY IS SHARED BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS CLIENT(S), CONSIDERING THE JOINT EFFORT AND DECISIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST AND ITS ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST THE CLIENT HOLDS IN THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST; THEREFORE THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

283

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN MORE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM CREATES A RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SPECIFIC CLIENTS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM IS DEEMED TO HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS MADE DURING THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DESIGN OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE IF THE FIRM HOLDS AN INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MAY INVEST IN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS OF THIRD-PARTY SECURITIZATIONS AND GENERALLY PURCHASES THESE INTERESTS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DIRECT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE RE-SECURITIZATION TRUST, EITHER BECAUSE IT WASN’T INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL DESIGN OF THE TRUST, OR THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY SPONSOR AND DEMONSTRATES SHARED POWER OVER THE CREATION OF THE TRUST; THEREFORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THE RE-SECURITIZATION VIE.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY AGENCY RE-SECURITIZATIONS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED

$76 MILLION

AND

$348 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF ASSETS, AND

$5 MILLION

AND

$139 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF LIABILITIES OF PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATIONS. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED RE-SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, TOTAL ASSETS (INCLUDING THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES) OF NONCONSOLIDATED FIRM-SPONSORED PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WERE

$4.6 BILLION

AND

$3.3 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM HELD APPROXIMATELY

$2.0 BILLION

AND

$3.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED AGENCY RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES, AND

$61 MILLION

AND

$14 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED PRIVATE-LABEL RE-SECURITIZATION ENTITIES. SEE THE TABLE ON PAGE 282 OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON INTERESTS HELD IN NONCONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASE INTERESTS IN, AND MAKE LOANS SECURED BY, POOLS OF RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM. THE CONDUITS FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE ASSETS ARE STRUCTURED WITH DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS BY THE CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS, AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS MITIGATE THE FIRM’S POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONDUITS.

TO ENSURE TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT PROVIDED BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ALSO PROVIDES THE MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT VEHICLES WITH UNCOMMITTED PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE FORM OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT REQUIRED IS BASED UPON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE AND APPROXIMATES

10%

OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE.

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES ITS FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS THE FIRM HAS BOTH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONDUITS AND A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE CONDUITS. AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND IN ITS ROLE IN STRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS, THE FIRM MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING ASSET TYPES AND CREDIT QUALITY, AND MANAGES THE COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING NEEDS OF THE CONDUITS. THE FIRM’S INTERESTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIES INCLUDE THE FEES RECEIVED AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LIQUIDITY AND PROGRAM-WIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE CREATED BY THE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES PROVIDED TO THE CONDUITS. SEE PAGE 288 OF THIS NOTE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON CONSOLIDATED VIE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

284

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN AND INVESTS IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THE FIRM HELD

$11.3 BILLION

OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE FIRM-ADMINISTERED MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

VIES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTOR INTERMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM CREATES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIES AND ALSO STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE VIES, TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVES, TO MEET INVESTOR NEEDS. THE FIRM MAY ALSO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET OR LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF VIES FOR WHICH THE FIRM IS ENGAGED IN ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS ARE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES, CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES AND ASSET SWAP VEHICLES.

MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES

THE FIRM HAS CREATED A SERIES OF TRUSTS THAT PROVIDE SHORT-TERM INVESTORS WITH QUALIFYING TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND THAT ALLOW INVESTORS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES TO FINANCE THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT RATES. IN A TYPICAL TRANSACTION, THE VEHICLE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE LONGER-TERM HIGHLY RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND FUNDS THE PURCHASE BY ISSUING TWO TYPES OF SECURITIES: (1) PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND (2) INVERSE FLOATING-RATE RESIDUAL INTERESTS (“RESIDUAL INTERESTS”). THE MATURITY OF EACH OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IS EQUAL TO THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE, WHILE THE MATURITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS IS TYPICALLY LONGER. HOLDERS OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES MAY “PUT,” OR TENDER, THE CERTIFICATES IF THE REMARKETING AGENT CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REMARKET THE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES TO ANOTHER INVESTOR. A LIQUIDITY FACILITY CONDITIONALLY OBLIGATES THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE TENDERED FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. UPON TERMINATION OF THE VEHICLE, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS WOULD FIRST REPAY ANY FUNDED LIQUIDITY FACILITY OR OUTSTANDING FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND THE REMAINING AMOUNT, IF ANY, WOULD BE PAID TO THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS. IF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY, IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER HAS RECOURSE TO THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS FOR

REIMBURSEMENT. CERTAIN RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL WITH THE FIRM, AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, TO SUPPORT SUCH REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS SHOULD THE MARKET VALUE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS DECLINE.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. OFTEN SERVES AS THE SOLE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT, OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER’S OBLIGATION TO PERFORM IS CONDITIONAL AND IS LIMITED BY CERTAIN TERMINATION EVENTS, WHICH INCLUDE BANKRUPTCY OR FAILURE TO PAY BY THE MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUER OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROVIDER, AN EVENT OF TAXABILITY ON THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OR THE IMMEDIATE DOWNGRADE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE EXCESS COLLATERALIZATION IN THE VEHICLE, OR IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDERS. HOWEVER, A DOWNGRADE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.’S SHORT-TERM RATING DOES NOT AFFECT THE FIRM’S OBLIGATION UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITY.

THE LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING RATE CERTIFICATES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE CREDIT RATING OF ANY INSURER OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BOND, AND THE FIRM’S SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATING AS LIQUIDITY PROVIDER. A DOWNGRADE IN ANY OF THESE RATINGS WOULD AFFECT THE RATING OF THE PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR THESE CERTIFICATES BY INVESTORS TO DECLINE OR DISAPPEAR.

AS REMARKETING AGENT, THE FIRM MAY HOLD PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM HELD

$893 MILLION

AND

$637 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF THESE CERTIFICATES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE LARGEST AMOUNT HELD BY THE FIRM AT ANY TIME DURING

2012

WAS

$1.8 BILLION

, OR

8%

, OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES’ AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PUTTABLE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES. THE FIRM DID NOT HAVE AND CONTINUES NOT TO HAVE ANY INTENT TO PROTECT ANY RESIDUAL INTEREST HOLDER FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ANY OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND HOLDINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTEREST. THE RESIDUAL INTEREST GENERALLY ALLOWS THE OWNER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE, PRIMARILY BY DIRECTING THE SALE OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS OWNED BY THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION, THE RESIDUAL INTEREST OWNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AND BEAR LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MUNICIPAL BOND

VEHICLE. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES IF IT DOES NOT OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, SINCE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLE.

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE AND ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES TRANSACTIONS WITH CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY RATED ASSETS, SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT WHICH THE VIE OTHERWISE DOES NOT HOLD. THE VIE THEN ISSUES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES (“CLNS”) WITH MATURITIES PREDOMINANTLY RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE VIE’S INVESTORS. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN PREFER USING A CLN VEHICLE SINCE THE CLNS ISSUED BY THE VIE GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN SUCH NOTES WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY IN A CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COLLATERAL PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES IS LARGELY INVESTMENT-GRADE, WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT BEING RATED “AAA.” THE FIRM DIVIDES ITS CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES BROADLY INTO TWO TYPES: STATIC AND MANAGED.

IN A STATIC CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT EITHER REFERENCE A SINGLE CREDIT (E.G., A MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATION), OR ALL OR PART OF A FIXED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. IN A MANAGED CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURE, THE CLNS AND ASSOCIATED CREDIT

DERIVATIVE GENERALLY REFERENCE ALL OR PART OF AN ACTIVELY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF CREDITS. AN AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN A PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND THE VIE THAT GIVES THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE EACH REFERENCED CREDIT IN THE PORTFOLIO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CREDIT. THE FIRM DOES NOT ACT AS PORTFOLIO MANAGER; ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO BEING A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. AS A NET BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION, IN BOTH STATIC AND MANAGED CREDIT-RELATED NOTE STRUCTURES, THE FIRM PAYS A PREMIUM TO THE VIE IN RETURN FOR THE RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT (UP TO THE NOTIONAL OF THE DERIVATIVE) IF ONE OR MORE OF THE CREDITS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO DEFAULTS, OR IF THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT OF REFERENCE CREDITS EXCEED SPECIFIED LEVELS. THE FIRM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE VIE. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HAS NOT HISTORICALLY PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CLN VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. SINCE EACH CLN IS ESTABLISHED TO THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE INVESTORS, THE INVESTORS HAVE THE POWER OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THAT VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLN. FURTHERMORE, THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE CREDIT-RELATED NOTE ENTITIES. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

ASSET SWAP VEHICLES

THE FIRM STRUCTURES AND EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSET SWAP VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INVESTORS. IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS, THE VIE PURCHASES A SPECIFIC ASSET OR ASSETS AND THEN ENTERS INTO A DERIVATIVE WITH THE FIRM IN ORDER TO TAILOR THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY RISK, OR BOTH, ACCORDING TO INVESTORS’ REQUIREMENTS. GENERALLY, THE ASSETS ARE HELD BY THE VIE TO MATURITY, AND THE TENOR OF THE DERIVATIVES WOULD MATCH THE MATURITY OF THE ASSETS. INVESTORS TYPICALLY INVEST IN THE NOTES ISSUED BY SUCH VIES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE SPECIFIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK THAT IS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE FIRM AND THE VIE MAY INCLUDE CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY INTO THE INVESTORS’ LOCAL CURRENCY OR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF ASSETS HELD BY THE VIE; TO ADD ADDITIONAL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE INTO THE VIE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RETURN ON THE ISSUED NOTES; OR TO CONVERT AN INTEREST-BEARING ASSET INTO A ZERO-COUPON BOND.

THE FIRM’S EXPOSURE TO ASSET SWAP VEHICLES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO ITS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTEREST RATE AND/OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FIRM HISTORICALLY HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES OVER AND ABOVE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE FIRM DOES NOT GENERALLY CONSOLIDATE THESE ASSET SWAP VEHICLES, SINCE THE FIRM DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES OF THESE ENTITIES AND DOES NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT. AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, THE FIRM HAS A SENIOR CLAIM ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE VIE AND REPORTS SUCH DERIVATIVES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS PURCHASED BY SUCH VIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE.

THE FIRM CONSOLIDATED FIRM-SPONSORED AND THIRD-PARTY CREDIT-RELATED NOTE VEHICLES WITH COLLATERAL FAIR VALUES OF

$483 MILLION

AND

$231 MILLION

, AT

AND

2011.

VIES SPONSORED BY THIRD PARTIES

VIE USED IN FRBNY TRANSACTION

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER IN JUNE 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK (“FRBNY”) TOOK CONTROL, THROUGH AN LLC FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE, OF A PORTFOLIO OF

$30.0 BILLION

IN ASSETS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 14, 2008. THE ASSETS OF THE LLC WERE FUNDED BY A

$28.85 BILLION

TERM LOAN FROM THE FRBNY AND A

$1.15 BILLION

SUBORDINATED LOAN FROM JPMORGAN CHASE. THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN WAS SUBORDINATED TO THE

FRBNY LOAN AND BORE THE FIRST

$1.15 BILLION

OF ANY LOSSES OF THE PORTFOLIO. ANY REMAINING ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AFTER REPAYMENT OF THE FRBNY LOAN, REPAYMENT OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN AND THE EXPENSE OF THE LLC WAS FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE FRBNY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FRBNY AND JPMORGAN CHASE LOANS WERE REPAID DEPENDED ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND THE LIQUIDATION STRATEGY DIRECTED BY THE FRBNY. THE FIRM DID NOT CONSOLIDATE THE LLC, AS IT DID NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE’S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. IN JUNE 2012, THE FRBNY LOAN WAS REPAID IN FULL AND IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE JPMORGAN CHASE LOAN WAS REPAID IN FULL. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF

$665 MILLION

$1.15 BILLION

SUBORDINATED LOAN PLUS CONTRACTUAL INTEREST.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

THE FIRM SECURITIZES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF LOANS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD, AUTOMOBILE, STUDENT AND COMMERCIAL (PRIMARILY RELATED TO REAL ESTATE) LOANS, AS WELL AS DEBT SECURITIES. THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THESE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS ARE TO SATISFY INVESTOR DEMAND AND TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FIRM.

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE TRUST, THE FIRM RECORDS THE TRANSFER OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE TO THE TRUST AS A SALE WHEN THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE: (1) THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRM’S CREDITORS; (2) THE TRANSFEREE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST

HOLDER CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (E.G., THE FIRM CANNOT REPURCHASE THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS).

FOR LOAN SECURITIZATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE, THE FIRM RECOGNIZES A GAIN OR LOSS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED (INCLUDING CASH, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS, OR SERVICING ASSETS RECEIVED) AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS SOLD. GAINS AND LOSSES ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE.

THESE LOANS AND EXCESS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURITIZATION BY THE AGENCIES, WHICH ALSO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OF THE LOANS AND EXCESS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS THROUGH CERTAIN GUARANTEE PROVISIONS. THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE SECURITIZATION VEHICLES AS IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOAN SALES, THE FIRM IS OBLIGATED TO

SHARE A PORTION OF THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOLD LOANS WITH THE PURCHASER. SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED UPON COMPLETION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION, GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE MAY BE IMPAIRMENT.

THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE RELATED REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE DETERMINED BASED ON HOW THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED AND HOW THEY ARE REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S OPERATING COMMITTEE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS GOODWILL ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE NET REDUCTION IN GOODWILL FROM 2010 TO 2011 WAS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO AM’S SALE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN AN ASSET MANAGER.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

OR

2011

, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DUE TO IMPAIRMENT DURING

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED IN TWO STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS COMPARED WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE (INCLUDING GOODWILL), THEN A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED. IN THE SECOND STEP, THE IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT (AS DETERMINED IN STEP ONE) TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF THE REPORTING UNIT, AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE BEING ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE RESULTING IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. IF THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

291

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IS LESS THAN ITS IMPLIED CURRENT FAIR VALUE, THEN NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

THE FIRM USES THE REPORTING UNITS’ ALLOCATED EQUITY PLUS GOODWILL CAPITAL AS A PROXY FOR THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EQUITY FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. REPORTING UNIT EQUITY IS DETERMINED ON A SIMILAR BASIS AS THE ALLOCATION OF EQUITY TO THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS

, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPITAL THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WOULD REQUIRE IF IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING BASEL III), ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. P

ROPOSED LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY LEVELS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE FIRM’S ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS, WHICH IS REVIEWED BY THE FIRM’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ALLOCATED EQUITY IS FURTHER REVIEWED ON A PERIODIC BASIS AND UPDATED AS NEEDED.

THE PRIMARY METHOD THE FIRM USES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS THE INCOME APPROACH. THE MODELS PROJECT CASH FLOWS FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD AND USE THE PERPETUITY GROWTH METHOD TO CALCULATE TERMINAL VALUES. THESE CASH FLOWS AND TERMINAL VALUES ARE THEN DISCOUNTED USING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. PROJECTIONS OF CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS’ EARNINGS FORECASTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE “DODD-FRANK ACT”), THE CARD ACT, AND LIMITATIONS ON NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND OVERDRAFT FEES), AND WHICH ARE REVIEWED WITH THE OPERATING COMMITTEE OF THE FIRM. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF EQUITY FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT AND IS DETERMINED CONSIDERING THE FIRM’S OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY (ESTIMATED USING THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL), AS ADJUSTED FOR THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO EACH REPORTING UNIT (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF RISK OR UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS OR MANAGEMENT’S FORECASTS AND ASSUMPTIONS). TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT MANAGEMENT COMPARES THE DISCOUNT RATE TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR BUSINESSES AND RISK CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF EQUITY (AGGREGATING THE VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS) IS COMPARED WITH THE FIRMS’ OVERALL ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY TO ENSURE REASONABLENESS.

THE VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS ARE THEN COMPARED WITH MARKET-BASED TRADING AND TRANSACTION MULTIPLES FOR RELEVANT COMPETITORS. TRADING AND TRANSACTION COMPARABLES ARE USED AS GENERAL INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE GENERAL REASONABLENESS OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ALTHOUGH PRECISE CONCLUSIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE DRAWN DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES THAT NATURALLY EXIST BETWEEN THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES AND COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS. MANAGEMENT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S REPORTING UNITS AND JPMORGAN CHASE’S MARKET CAPITALIZATION. IN EVALUATING THIS COMPARISON, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING (A) A CONTROL PREMIUM THAT WOULD EXIST IN A MARKET TRANSACTION, (B) FACTORS RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF EXECUTION RISK THAT WOULD EXIST AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL THAT DO NOT EXIST AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AND (C) SHORT-TERM MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS.

WHILE NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS RECOGNIZE

D,

T

HE FIRM’S MORTGAGE LENDING BUSINESS IN CCB REMAIN AT AN ELEVATED RISK OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DUE TO ITS EXPOSURE TO U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE VALUATION OF THIS BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT UPON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (INCLUDING NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND HOME PRICES), REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES (FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES), AND THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL REQUIRED. IN ADDITION, THE EARNINGS OR ESTIMATED COST OF EQUITY OF THE FIRM’S CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESSES COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION MODELS WERE DETERMINED USING MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATES. THE COST OF EQUITY REFLECTED THE RELATED RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND WAS EVALUATED IN COMPARISON TO RELEVANT MARKET PEERS. DETERIORATION IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED GOODWILL TO DECLINE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN A FUTURE PERIOD RELATED TO SOME PORTION OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR PERFORMING SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. THE FAIR VALUE CONSIDERS ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICING FEES AND ANCILLARY REVENUE, OFFSET BY ESTIMATED COSTS TO SERVICE THE LOANS, AND GENERALLY DECLINES OVER TIME AS NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS ARE RECEIVED, EFFECTIVELY AMORTIZING THE MSR ASSET AGAINST CONTRACTUAL SERVICING AND ANCILLARY FEE INCOME. MSRS ARE EITHER PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RECOGNIZED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS IF SERVICING IS RETAINED.

AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS MSRS AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM TREATS ITS MSRS AS A SINGLE CLASS OF SERVICING ASSETS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS MSR ASSET AND ITS TREATMENT OF MSRS AS ONE AGGREGATE POOL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING AN OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (“OAS”) MODEL, WHICH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRM’S PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, COSTS TO SERVICE, LATE CHARGES AND OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE, AND ALSO CONSIDERS RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE.

292

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. MSRS TYPICALLY DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE BECAUSE DECLINING INTEREST RATES TEND TO INCREASE PREPAYMENTS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS THAT COMPRISE THE MSR ASSET. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (E.G., MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (I.E., THOSE FOR WHICH THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS) INCREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. JPMORGAN CHASE USES COMBINATIONS OF DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY INTEREST-RATE RELATED CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS.

THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ADVANCES IS MINIMAL BECAUSE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE ADVANCES IS SENIOR TO ALL CASH PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAINTAINS THE RIGHT TO STOP PAYMENT TO INVESTORS IF THE COLLATERAL IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE ADVANCE.

(E)

INCLUDES EXCESS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS TRANSFERRED TO AN AGENCY-SPONSORED TRUST IN EXCHANGE FOR STRIPPED MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES (“SMBS”). A PORTION OF THE SMBS WAS ACQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES AT THE TRANSACTION DATE; THE FIRM ACQUIRED AND HAS RETAINED THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THOSE SMBS AS TRADING ASSETS.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR DECREASED BY

$6.4 BILLION

. THIS DECREASE WAS PREDOMINATELY DUE TO A DECLINE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF

$5.4 BILLION

. THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY GAINS OF

$5.6 BILLION

ON DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE THE MSR ASSET; THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS SEPARATELY FROM THE MSR ASSET. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET WAS A

$1.7 BILLION

DECREASE RELATED TO REVISED COST TO SERVICE AND ANCILLARY INCOME ASSUMPTIONS INCORPORATED IN THE MSR VALUATION. THE INCREASED COST TO SERVICE ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF HIGHER SERVICING COSTS TO ENHANCE SERVICING PROCESSES, PARTICULARLY LOAN MODIFICATION AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES, INCLUDING COSTS TO COMPLY WITH CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO WITH BANKING REGULATORS. THE INCREASE IN THE COST TO SERVICE ASSUMPTION CONTEMPLATES SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED INCREASES IN STAFFING LEVELS IN THE CORE AND DEFAULT SERVICING FUNCTIONS. THE DECREASED ANCILLARY INCOME ASSUMPTION IS SIMILARLY RELATED TO A REASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS PRACTICES IN CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSENT ORDERS AND THE EXISTING INDUSTRY-WIDE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS BROADLY AFFECTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

ALSO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM REVISED ITS OAS ASSUMPTION AND UPDATED ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL; THESE CHANGES HAD GENERALLY OFFSETTING EFFECTS. THE FIRM’S OAS ASSUMPTION IS BASED UPON CAPITAL AND RETURN REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM BELIEVES A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE PENDING BASEL III CAPITAL RULES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OAS ASSUMPTION FOR THE FIRM’S PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

400

BASIS POINTS AND DECREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION.

SINCE 2009, THE FIRM HAS CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL BASED ON A NUMBER OF MARKET-RELATED FACTORS, INCLUDING A DOWNWARD TREND IN HOME PRICES, A GENERAL TIGHTENING OF CREDIT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON REFINANCING ACTIVITY. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, THE FIRM FURTHER ENHANCED ITS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL TO INCORPORATE: (I) THE IMPACT OF THE HOME AFFORDABLE REFINANCE PROGRAM (“HARP”) 2.0, AND (II)ASSUMPTIONS THAT WILL LIMIT MODELED REFINANCINGS DUE TO THE COMBINED INFLUENCES OF RELATIVELY STRICT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND REDUCED LEVELS OF EXPECTED HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE REFINEMENTS INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION.

THE DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR RESULTS IN A LOWER ASSET VALUE THAT WILL AMORTIZE IN FUTURE PERIODS AGAINST CONTRACTUAL AND ANCILLARY FEE INCOME RECEIVED IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHILE THERE IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER LEVELS OF NONINTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SERVICING COSTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THOSE FUTURE PERIODS, THERE WILL ALSO BE LESS MSR AMORTIZATION, WHICH WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME. THE AMORTIZATION OF THE MSR IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLES ABOVE UNDER “CHANGES DUE TO MODELED AMORTIZATION.”

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON VARIATION IN ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE ARE OFTEN HIGHLY INTER-RELATED AND MAY NOT BE LINEAR. IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH WOULD EITHER MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE IMPACT OF THE INITIAL CHANGE.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING

THE FIRM’S INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET COMPARES THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED. IF THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE

HAS RECORDED IMMATERIAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ASBESTOS REMEDIATION IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE THE OBLIGATIONS’ FAIR VALUE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 26 – INCOME TAXES

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO PROVIDE INCOME TAXES ON ALL TRANSACTIONS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE TAX RATES THAT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE’S EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRM’S BUSINESSES, AND FROM CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THUS, THE FIRM’S FINAL TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED.

THE COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE/(BENEFIT) INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME WERE AS FOLLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED

THE PRECEDING TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD DIRECTLY IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRM’S EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TAX EFFECT OF ALL ITEMS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY RESULTED IN A DECREASE OF

$1.9 BILLION

IN

2012

, AND INCREASES OF

$927 MILLION

AND

$1.8 BILLION

IN

2011

AND

2010

, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REINVESTED ABROAD FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. DURING 2012, AS PART OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S ONGOING REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF CERTAIN OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED U.S. PARENT, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD NO LONGER BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED. THIS DETERMINATION RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF

$80 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR YEARS’ UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. BASED ON JPMORGAN CHASE’S ONGOING REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, COMBINED WITH THE FORMATION OF SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND STEPS TAKEN TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS, THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED TO FUND CURRENT AND FUTURE GROWTH OF THE RELATED BUSINESSES. AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO USE THE EARNINGS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS U.S. OPERATIONS, SUCH EARNINGS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FOR

2012

, PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$3.1 BILLION

WERE GENERATED AND WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRETAX EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED

$25.1 BILLION

. IF THE FIRM WERE TO RECORD A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, THE AMOUNT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

THE PRIOR PERIOD HAS BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF

$1.1 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, IN CONNECTION WITH U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION

; THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WAS APPROXIMATELY

$269 MILLION

; AND THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD WAS APPROXIMATELY

$525 MILLION.

IF NOT UTILIZED, THE U.S. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND THE STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2027 AND 2030; AND THE U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARD WILL EXPIRE IN 2022.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WAS DUE TO LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. DURING 2012, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE DECREASED BY

$614 MILLION

LARGELY RELATED TO THE REALIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL TAX BENEFITS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, JPMORGAN CHASE’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES, WERE

$7.2 BILLION

,

$7.2 BILLION

AND

$7.8 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH

$4.2 BILLION

,

$4.0 BILLION

AND

$3.8 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WOULD NOT AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF THEY WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THESE UNRECOGNIZED ITEMS INCLUDE THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, THE PORTION OF GROSS STATE AND LOCAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT FROM ASSOCIATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS, AND THE PORTION OF GROSS NON-U.S. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT WOULD HAVE OFFSETS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AS JPMORGAN CHASE IS PRESENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY A NUMBER OF TAXING AUTHORITIES, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY CHANGES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN ITS GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAUSED BY SUCH AUDITS WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ITS ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

NOTE 27 – RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

THE BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

”) IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (“OCC”). THE BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, AND ITS DEPOSITS IN THE U.S. ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE “FEDERAL RESERVE”) REQUIRES DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES DEPOSITED BY THE FIRM’S BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$5.6 BILLION

AND

$4.4 BILLION

IN

2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO

10%

OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY’S TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH LOANS IS LIMITED TO

20%

OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY’S TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST FROM

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

, AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATOR’S OPINION, PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2013,

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S BANKING SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE,

$18.4 BILLION

IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. THE CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN

2013

WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES’ EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF

$25.1 BILLION

AND

$25.4 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, AND SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$0.7 BILLION

AND

$16.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED IN SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE FIRM HAD OTHER RESTRICTED CASH OF

$3.4 BILLION

AND

$4.2 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY REPRESENTING CASH RESERVES HELD AT NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS AND HELD FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES.

NOTE 28 – REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTABLISHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE OCC ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR THE FIRM’S NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.

, AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A.

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY, PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2 CAPITAL, AND THE AGGREGATE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL CAPITAL IS TIER 1 CAPITAL PLUS TIER 2 CAPITAL. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (“RWA”) CONSIST OF ON– AND OFF–BALANCE SHEET ASSETS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF SEVERAL BROAD RISK CATEGORIES AND WEIGHTED BY FACTORS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK AND POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULT. ON–BALANCE SHEET ASSETS ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE PERCEIVED CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY, THE NATURE OF ANY COLLATERAL, AND THE GUARANTOR, IF ANY. OFF–BALANCE SHEET ASSETS, SUCH AS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND DERIVATIVES, ARE RISK-WEIGHTED BY MULTIPLYING THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT BY THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT CONVERSION FACTOR TO DETERMINE THE ON–BALANCE SHEET CREDIT-EQUIVALENT AMOUNT, WHICH IS THEN RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE SAME FACTORS USED FOR ON–BALANCE SHEET ASSETS. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ALSO INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO APPLICABLE TRADING ASSETS–DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. THE RESULTING RISK-WEIGHTED VALUES FOR EACH OF THE RISK CATEGORIES ARE THEN AGGREGATED TO DETERMINE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

JPMORGAN CHASE

IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS (WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED QUARTERLY AVERAGE ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO TAKE ACTION. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

,

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE REGULATORY CAPITAL, ASSETS AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE

AND ITS SIGNIFICANT BANKING SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

. THESE AMOUNTS ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND/OR OCC. THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RWA TO REFLECT REGULATORY GUIDANCE REGARDING A LIMITED NUMBER OF MARKET RISK MODELS USED FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS HELD BY THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012, INCLUDING THE SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE ADJUSTMENT TO RWA DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CERTAIN MARKET RISK MODELS AND A REDUCTION IN RELATED POSITIONS.

NOTE 29 – OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE

PROVIDES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW UPON THE COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN OR A DEFAULT OCCURRING. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRM’S VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN CONSUMER (EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD) AND WHOLESALE CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES

276–279

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS AND CARRYING VALUES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW FOR CREDIT CARD AND HOME EQUITY LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENT THE TOTAL AVAILABLE CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS. THE FIRM HAS NOT EXPERIENCED, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE, THAT ALL AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE UTILIZED AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRM CAN REDUCE OR CANCEL CREDIT CARD LINES OF CREDIT BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW. THE FIRM MAY REDUCE OR CLOSE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY, OR WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLE DECLINE IN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. ALSO, THE FIRM TYPICALLY CLOSES CREDIT CARD LINES WHEN THE BORROWER IS

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM ACTS AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. IN ITS ROLE AS CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK, THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF THE CASH BORROWERS, USUALLY BROKER-DEALERS; HOWEVER, THIS EXPOSURE IS SECURED BY COLLATERAL AND TYPICALLY EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS BY THE END OF THE DAY.

GUARANTEES

U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE. U.S. GAAP DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE GUARANTOR TO PAY A GUARANTEED PARTY BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTY’S FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER U.S. GAAP: STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM INITIALLY RECORDS GUARANTEES AT THE INCEPTION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION ASSUMED (E.G., THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE). FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GUARANTEES, THE FIRM RECORDS THIS FAIR VALUE AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN CASH (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVED), OR OTHER ASSETS (FOR PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE). ANY PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IS REDUCED AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE CONTRACT, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING AND DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES OVER THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. FOR INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED IN SALES AGREEMENTS, A PORTION OF THE SALE PROCEEDS IS ALLOCATED TO THE GUARANTEE, WHICH ADJUSTS THE GAIN OR LOSS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT FROM THE TRANSACTION. FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, THE INITIAL LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED TO INCOME AS THE FIRM’S RISK IS REDUCED (I.E., OVER TIME OR WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES). ANY CONTINGENT LIABILITY THAT EXISTS AS A RESULT OF ISSUING THE GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION IS RECOGNIZED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE CONTINGENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT RECOGNIZED IF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION (ADJUSTED FOR ANY AMORTIZATION). THE RECORDED AMOUNTS OF THE LIABILITIES RELATED TO GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

ADVISED LINES OF CREDIT

AN ADVISED LINE OF CREDIT IS A REVOLVING CREDIT LINE WHICH SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM MAY MAKE AVAILABLE TO AN OBLIGOR, ON A NONBINDING BASIS. THE BORROWER RECEIVES WRITTEN OR ORAL ADVICE OF THIS FACILITY. THE FIRM MAY CANCEL THIS FACILITY AT ANY TIME BY PROVIDING THE BORROWER NOTICE OR, IN SOME CASES, WITHOUT NOTICE AS PERMITTED BY LAW.

SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS

THROUGH THE FIRM’S SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS’ SECURITIES, VIA CUSTODIAL AND NON-CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS, MAY BE LENT TO THIRD PARTIES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, THE FIRM PROVIDES AN INDEMNIFICATION IN THE LENDING AGREEMENTS WHICH PROTECTS THE LENDER AGAINST THE FAILURE OF THE BORROWER TO RETURN THE LENT SECURITIES. TO MINIMIZE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING

100%

OF THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN FROM THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL IS MARKED TO MARKET DAILY TO HELP ASSURE THAT COLLATERALIZATION IS ADEQUATE. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IS CALLED FROM THE BORROWER IF A SHORTFALL EXISTS, OR COLLATERAL MAY BE RELEASED TO THE BORROWER IN THE EVENT OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. IF A BORROWER DEFAULTS, THE FIRM WOULD USE THE COLLATERAL HELD TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT SECURITIES IN THE MARKET OR TO CREDIT THE LENDING CUSTOMER WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT THEREOF.

DERIVATIVES QUALIFYING AS GUARANTEES

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FIRM TRANSACTS CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER U.S. GAAP. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS UPON EXERCISE BY THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO WRITTEN PUT OPTION CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO MEET CLIENT NEEDS, OR FOR OTHER TRADING PURPOSES. THE TERMS OF WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. DERIVATIVE GUARANTEES ALSO INCLUDE CONTRACTS SUCH AS STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET VALUE AND THE BOOK VALUE OF A COUNTERPARTY’S REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THAT MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. STABLE VALUE DERIVATIVES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “STABLE VALUE WRAPS”, ARE TRANSACTED IN ORDER TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO REALIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS WITH LESS VOLATILITY THAN AN UNPROTECTED PORTFOLIO AND ARE TYPICALLY LONGER-TERM OR MAY HAVE NO STATED MATURITY, BUT ALLOW THE FIRM TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

$555 MILLION

AND DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF

$80 MILLION

AND

$98 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

UNSETTLED REVERSE REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS THAT SETTLE AT A FUTURE DATE. AT SETTLEMENT, THESE COMMITMENTS REQUIRE THAT THE FIRM ADVANCE CASH TO AND ACCEPT SECURITIES FROM THE COUNTERPARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE, AND THEREFORE, ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL SETTLEMENT DATE. AT

LOAN SALES- AND SECURITIZATION-RELATED INDEMNIFICATIONS

MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRM’S LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES WITH THE GSES AND OTHER LOAN SALE AND PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 16 ON PAGES

280–291

OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT

, THE FIRM HAS MADE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT THE LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MAY BE, AND HAS BEEN, REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE GSES AND OTHER INVESTORS FOR LOSSES DUE TO MATERIAL BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR BREACHES OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF SUCH LOANS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFECTS THAT WERE SOLD TO PURCHASERS (INCLUDING SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES) PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSE.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRM’S ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL FROM THE FDIC IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE FIRM RESOLVED AND/OR LIMITED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS FOR LOANS SOLD TO THE GSES BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE FIRM’S POSITION THAT SUCH OBLIGATIONS REMAIN WITH THE FDIC RECEIVERSHIP. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT IT HAS NO REMAINING EXPOSURE RELATED TO LOANS SOLD BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO THE GSES.

THERE HAVE BEEN GENERALIZED ALLEGATIONS, AS WELL AS SPECIFIC DEMANDS, THAT THE FIRM REPURCHASE LOANS SOLD OR DEPOSITED INTO PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS (INCLUDING CLAIMS FROM INSURERS THAT HAVE GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS). ALTHOUGH THE FIRM ENCOURAGES PARTIES TO USE THE CONTRACTUAL REPURCHASE PROCESS ESTABLISHED IN THE GOVERNING AGREEMENTS, THESE PRIVATE-LABEL REPURCHASE CLAIMS HAVE GENERALLY MANIFESTED THEMSELVES THROUGH THREATENED OR PENDING LITIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE LIABILITY RELATED TO REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THE PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS IS SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY THE FIRM IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO./2012 ANNUAL REPORT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, THE FIRM CONSIDERS.

(I)

THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING UNRESOLVED REPURCHASE DEMANDS,

(II)

ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE REPURCHASE DEMANDS CONSIDERING INFORMATION ABOUT FILE REQUESTS, DELINQUENT AND LIQUIDATED LOANS, RESOLVED AND UNRESOLVED MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSION NOTICES AND THE FIRM’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

(III)

THE POTENTIAL ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPURCHASE DEMANDS (“CURE RATE”),

(IV)

THE ESTIMATED SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OF THE LOAN OR COLLATERAL, MAKE-WHOLE SETTLEMENT, OR INDEMNIFICATION,

(V)

THE FIRM’S POTENTIAL ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS LOSSES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, AND

(VI)

THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MORTGAGE INSURERS AND OTHER PARTIES.

BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE FIRM HAS RECOGNIZED A MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY OF

$2.8 BILLION

AND

$3.6 BILLION

, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES NET OF PROBABLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS OF

$441 MILLION

AND

$577 MILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO COVER LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ALL LOANS PREVIOUSLY SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH LOAN SALE AND SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GSES, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THOSE LOSSES OCCUR OR HOW THEY ARE ULTIMATELY RESOLVED (E.G., REPURCHASE, MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT). THE LIABILITY RELATED TO ALL REPURCHASE DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVATE-LABEL SECURITIZATIONS IS SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY THE FIRM IN ESTABLISHING ITS LITIGATION RESERVES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FIRM’S ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTING ITS RECORDED MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY — INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE FUTURE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES (BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE FIRM’S EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE GSES FUTURE BEHAVIOR), THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CURE IDENTIFIED DEFECTS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE, AND RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES — REQUIRE APPLICATION OF A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

WHILE THE FIRM USES THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT IN ESTIMATING ITS MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY, THE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND IMPRECISE AND, ACCORDINGLY, LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF ITS ESTABLISHED REPURCHASE LIABILITY, IS FROM

$0

TO APPROXIMATELY

$0.9 BILLION

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS CONSIDERS THE FIRM’S GSE-RELATED EXPOSURE BASED ON AN ASSUMED PEAK TO TROUGH DECLINE IN HOME PRICES OF

40%

, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL

10

PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE IN HOME PRICES BEYOND THE FIRM’S CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS (WHICH WERE DERIVED FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HOME PRICE INDEX). ALTHOUGH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER A FURTHER DECLINE IN HOME PRICES OF THIS MAGNITUDE LIKELY TO OCCUR, SUCH A DECLINE COULD INCREASE THE LEVELS OF LOAN DELINQUENCIES, WHICH MAY, IN TURN, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REPURCHASE DEMANDS FROM THE GSES AND POTENTIALLY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASES OF LOANS AT GREATER LOSS SEVERITIES; EACH OF THESE FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE FIRM’S MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOANS SOLD WITH RECOURSE

THE FIRM PROVIDES SERVICING FOR MORTGAGES AND CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LENDING PRODUCTS ON BOTH A RECOURSE AND NONRECOURSE BASIS. IN NONRECOURSE SERVICING, THE PRINCIPAL CREDIT RISK TO THE FIRM IS THE COST OF TEMPORARY SERVICING ADVANCES OF FUNDS (I.E., NORMAL SERVICING ADVANCES). IN RECOURSE SERVICING, THE SERVICER AGREES TO SHARE CREDIT RISK WITH THE OWNER OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC OR A PRIVATE INVESTOR, INSURER OR GUARANTOR. LOSSES ON RECOURSE SERVICING PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR WHEN FORECLOSURE SALES PROCEEDS OF THE PROPERTY UNDERLYING A DEFAULTED LOAN ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE LOAN AND THE COST OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY. THE FIRM’S SECURITIZATIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY NONRECOURSE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRING THE RISK OF FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES TO THE PURCHASER OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST. AT

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS – GENERAL

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT ALSO MAY INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN LIEU OF MAKING A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE TO CLIENTS (“SOFTWARE LICENSEES”) OR WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY (“THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS”), PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES SOFTWARE LICENSEES FOR CLAIMS OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES THAT MAY OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE, OR THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES THEY MAY INCUR DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS OR ASSETS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

CREDIT CARD CHARGE-BACKS

CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, CARD’S MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS AND A SUBSIDIARY OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN PAYMENT PROCESSING AND MERCHANT ACQUIRING.

UNDER THE RULES OF VISA USA, INC., AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., IS LIABLE PRIMARILY FOR THE AMOUNT OF EACH PROCESSED CREDIT CARD SALES

TRANSACTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBER’S FAVOR, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL (THROUGH THE CARDMEMBER’S ISSUING BANK) CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND WILL CHARGE BACK THE TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF CHASE PAYMENTECH IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE MERCHANT, CHASE PAYMENTECH WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE CARDMEMBER. CHASE PAYMENTECH MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING FUTURE SETTLEMENTS, RETAINING CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS OR BY OBTAINING OTHER SECURITY. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: (1) A MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; (2) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND (3) CHASE PAYMENTECH DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE COLLATERAL HELD BY CHASE PAYMENTECH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRM’S CHARGE BACK-RELATED OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAYMENT OR PERFORMANCE RISK TO THE FIRM, IS IMMATERIAL.

EXCHANGE AND CLEARINGHOUSE GUARANTEES

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARINGHOUSES, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATIONS VARY WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRM’S CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBER’S GUARANTEE FUND, OR, IN A FEW CASES, THE OBLIGATION MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRM’S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

THE FIRM CLEARS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS THROUGH VARIOUS CLEARINGHOUSES, AND THE FIRM STANDS BEHIND THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS CLIENTS ON SUCH TRADES. THE FIRM MITIGATES ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN THE EVENT OF A CLIENT DEFAULT BY REQUIRING THAT CLIENTS PROVIDE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF MARGIN AT THE INCEPTION AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND CAN CEASE THE PROVISION OF CLEARING SERVICES

HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANY MATERIAL PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE RISK OF LOSS IS EXPECTED TO BE REMOTE.

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (“PARENT COMPANY”) MAY PROVIDE COUNTERPARTIES WITH GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN OF THE TRADING AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS, AS NEGOTIATED WITH THE FIRM’S COUNTERPARTIES. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, OR ARE REFLECTED AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS; THEREFORE, THE PARENT COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED A SEPARATE LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT THAT WOULD TRIGGER PAYMENTS BY THE PARENT COMPANY UNDER THESE GUARANTEES IS REMOTE.

THE PARENT COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BOTH LONG-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES SOLD AS PART OF THE FIRM’S MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. THESE GUARANTEES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE

NOTE 31 – LITIGATION

CONTINGENCIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FIRM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DEFENDANTS OR PUTATIVE DEFENDANTS IN NUMEROUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PRIVATE, CIVIL LITIGATIONS AND REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. THE LITIGATIONS RANGE FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS INVOLVING A SINGLE PLAINTIFF TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WITH POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF CLASS MEMBERS. INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVE BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS, BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE AT VARYING STAGES OF ADJUDICATION, ARBITRATION OR INVESTIGATION, AND INVOLVE EACH OF THE FIRM’S LINES OF BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CLAIMS (INCLUDING COMMON LAW TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AND STATUTORY ANTITRUST, SECURITIES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIMS), SOME OF WHICH PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES.

THE FIRM BELIEVES THE ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES, IN EXCESS OF RESERVES ESTABLISHED, FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS FROM

$0

TO APPROXIMATELY

$6.1 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012. THIS ESTIMATED AGGREGATE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES IS BASED UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THOSE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE FIRM IS INVOLVED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FIRM’S BEST ESTIMATE OF SUCH LOSSES FOR THOSE CASES FOR WHICH SUCH ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE. FOR CERTAIN CASES, THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN CURRENTLY BE MADE. THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, GIVEN THE VARYING STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY ARE CURRENTLY IN PRELIMINARY STAGES), THE EXISTENCE IN MANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS OF MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (INCLUDING THE FIRM) WHOSE SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED, THE NUMEROUS YET-UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN MANY OF THE PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING ISSUES REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THE SCOPE OF MANY OF THE CLAIMS) AND THE ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM’S ESTIMATE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL LOSSES MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE CURRENT ESTIMATE.

SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRM’S MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MARCH 2008, SEVERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS OF A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, CONCERNING POSSIBLE STATE AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES (“ARS”). THE MARKET FOR MANY SUCH SECURITIES HAD FROZEN AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AUCTIONS FOR THOSE SECURITIES BEGAN TO FAIL IN FEBRUARY 2008.

THE FIRM, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND AFFILIATES, AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE WHICH PROVIDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE FIRM WOULD OFFER TO PURCHASE AT PAR CERTAIN ARS PURCHASED FROM J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC, CHASE INVESTMENT SERVICES CORP. AND BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC. BY INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS, CHARITIES AND SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THE FIRM ALSO AGREED TO A SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION (“NASAA”) TASK FORCE, WHICH AGREED TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT TO ALL REMAINING STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE FIRM HAS FINALIZED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PENALTIES TOTALING

$25 MILLION

TO ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES. TO DATE, FINAL CONSENT AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITH ALL BUT

THREE

OF NASAA’S MEMBERS.

THE FIRM ALSO WAS NAMED IN

TWO

PUTATIVE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS. THE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEFENDANTS, COLLUDED TO MAINTAIN AND STABILIZE THE ARS MARKET AND THEN TO WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE ARS MARKET. IN JANUARY 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED BOTH ACTIONS. AN APPEAL IS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING.

IN JANUARY 2013, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

INC., AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FORMERLY EMPLOYED BY BEAR STEARNS ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS (COLLECTIVELY THE “BEAR STEARNS DEFENDANTS”) IN MULTIPLE CIVIL ACTIONS AND ARBITRATIONS RELATING TO ALLEGED

(THE “HIGH GRADE FUND”) AND THE BEAR STEARNS HIGH GRADE STRUCTURED CREDIT STRATEGIES ENHANCED LEVERAGE MASTER FUND, LTD. (THE “ENHANCED LEVERAGE FUND”) (COLLECTIVELY THE “FUNDS”). BSAM SERVED AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR BOTH OF THE FUNDS, WHICH WERE ORGANIZED SUCH THAT THERE WERE U.S. AND CAYMAN ISLANDS “FEEDER FUNDS” THAT INVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THEIR ASSETS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE FUNDS. THE FUNDS ARE IN LIQUIDATION.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY

THREE

CIVIL ACTIONS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK RELATING TO THE FUNDS.

ONE

OF THESE ACTIONS INVOLVES A DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PURCHASERS OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE U.S. FEEDER FUND TO THE ENHANCED LEVERAGE FUND, ALLEGING THAT THE BEAR STEARNS DEFENDANTS MISMANAGED THE FUNDS. THIS ACTION SEEKS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BASED ON ALLEGED INVESTOR LOSSES. THE PARTIES HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THIS DERIVATIVE ACTION, PURSUANT TO WHICH BSAM WOULD PAY A MAXIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY

$18 MILLION

. IN APRIL 2012, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF THIS SETTLEMENT. IN MAY 2012, OBJECTORS REPRESENTING CERTAIN INTERESTS IN THE U.S. FEEDER FUND FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT FROM THE DISTRICT COURT’S FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT. THAT APPEAL IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

THE SECOND PENDING ACTION, BROUGHT BY THE JOINT VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATORS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS FEEDER FUNDS, MAKES ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE ASSERTED IN THE DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS RELATED TO THE U.S. FEEDER FUNDS. THIS ACTION ALLEGES NET LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$700 MILLION

AND SEEKS COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE PARTIES RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO RESOLVE THE LITIGATION CONTINGENT ON THE EXECUTION OF A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

$4 BILLION

SECURITIZATION IN MAY 2007 KNOWN AS A “CDO-SQUARED,” FOR WHICH BSAM SERVED AS COLLATERAL MANAGER. THIS SECURITIZATION WAS COMPOSED OF CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATION HOLDINGS THAT WERE PURCHASED BY BOFA FROM THE FUNDS. BOFA CURRENTLY SEEKS DAMAGES UP TO APPROXIMATELY

$540 MILLION

. MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ARE PENDING.

BEAR STEARNS SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

THE ACTIONS ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS ISSUED MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING BEAR STEARNS’ BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THAT, AS A RESULT OF THOSE FALSE STATEMENTS, BEAR STEARNS’ COMMON STOCK TRADED AT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED PRICES DURING THE CLASS PERIOD. IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE UNITED

$275 MILLION

SETTLEMENT.

BEAR STEARNS, FORMER MEMBERS OF BEAR STEARNS’ BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF BEAR STEARNS’ FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE AND CLASS ACTION SUIT WHICH IS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALSO ALLEGED TO HAVE SOLD THEIR HOLDINGS OF BEAR STEARNS COMMON STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT. THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED THE ACTION IN JANUARY 2011, AND PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE PLANS. THE COMPLAINTS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THE DUTY OF PRUDENCE BY ALLOWING INVESTMENT IN THE FIRM’S COMMON STOCK WHEN THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH STOCK WAS UNSUITABLE FOR THE PLANS AND THAT THE FIRM AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS MADE FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE FIRM’S FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, AND A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN DECEMBER 2012 WHICH ALLEGES A CLASS PERIOD OF DECEMBER 20, 2011 TO JULY 12, 2012. THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT CONTAINS ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINTS, BUT NOW ASSERTS CLAIMS ONLY ON BEHALF OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE FIRM’S 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN.

FOUR

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED, PURPORTEDLY ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM, AGAINST CERTAIN OF THE FIRM’S CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES.

MORGAN SECURITIES LLC SETTLED WITH THE SEC TO RESOLVE ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THOSE TRANSACTIONS. FOLLOWING THAT SETTLEMENT, THE COUNTY FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE FIRM AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS IN ALABAMA STATE COURT. AN ACTION ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF SEWER RATE PAYERS HAS ALSO BEEN FILED IN ALABAMA STATE COURT. THE SUITS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM MADE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES IN EXCHANGE FOR BEING CHOSEN TO UNDERWRITE MORE THAN

$3 BILLION

IN WARRANTS ISSUED BY THE COUNTY AND TO ACT AS THE COUNTERPARTY FOR CERTAIN SWAPS EXECUTED BY THE COUNTY. THE COMPLAINTS ALSO ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM CONCEALED THESE THIRD-PARTY PAYMENTS AND THAT, BUT FOR THIS CONCEALMENT, THE COUNTY WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THE TRANSACTIONS. THE COURT DENIED THE FIRM’S MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS IN BOTH PROCEEDINGS. IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2011, THE COUNTY FILED NOTICES OF BANKRUPTCY WITH THE TRIAL COURT IN EACH OF THE CASES AND WITH THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT STATING THAT IT WAS A CHAPTER 9 DEBTOR IN THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PORTION OF THE SEWER RATE PAYER ACTION INVOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST THE FIRM WAS REMOVED BY CERTAIN DEFENDANTS TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.

IN ITS ORDER FINDING THAT REMOVAL OF THIS ACTION WAS PROPER, THE DISTRICT COURT REFERRED THE ACTION TO THE DISTRICT’S BANKRUPTCY COURT, WHERE THE ACTION REMAINS PENDING. LIMITED DISCOVERY HAS TAKEN

PLACE IN THE COUNTY’S ACTION AND ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY MAY TAKE PLACE IN 2013.

$1.6 BILLION

IN DAMAGES FROM THE FIRM AND OTHER DEFENDANTS INVOLVED IN THE JEFFERSON COUNTY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

PLAINTIFFS SUBSEQUENTLY AGREED TO DISMISS THEIR TORT CLAIMS SEEKING DAMAGES AND ARE SOLELY PURSUING THEIR CLAIMS RELATING TO THE VALIDITY OF THE WARRANTS. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THESE CLAIMS REMAINS PENDING.

TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON WARRANTS ISSUED BY THE COUNTY HAVE FILED SEPARATE ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM IN NEW YORK STATE COURT. THEIR COMPLAINTS ASSERT THAT THE FIRM FRAUDULENTLY MISLED THEM INTO ISSUING INSURANCE BASED UPON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGED CONDUCT DESCRIBED ABOVE AND OTHER ALLEGED NON-DISCLOSURES. ONE INSURER CLAIMS THAT IT INSURED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NEARLY

$1.2 BILLION

AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF

$400 MILLION

AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE OTHER INSURER CLAIMS THAT IT INSURED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF MORE THAN

$378 MILLION

AND SEEKS RECOVERY OF

$4 MILLION

ALLEGEDLY PAID UNDER THE POLICIES TO DATE AS WELL AS ANY FUTURE PAYMENTS AND UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COURT DENIED THE FIRM’S MOTIONS TO DISMISS EACH OF THE COMPLAINTS. THE FIRM HAS FILED A CROSS-CLAIM AND A THIRD PARTY CLAIM AGAINST THE COUNTY FOR INDEMNITY AND CONTRIBUTION. THE COUNTY MOVED TO DISMISS, WHICH THE COURT DENIED IN AUGUST 2011. IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS NOVEMBER 2011 BANKRUPTCY FILING, THE COUNTY HAS ASSERTED THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE STAYED. IN FEBRUARY 2012, ONE OF THE INSURERS FILED A MOTION FOR A DECLARATION THAT ITS ACTION IS NOT STAYED AS AGAINST THE FIRM OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR AN ORDER LIFTING THE STAY AS AGAINST THE FIRM. THE FIRM AND THE COUNTY OPPOSED THE MOTION, WHICH REMAINS PENDING.

WITH RESPECT TO THE FORMER WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STEARNS DEFENDANTS WHO PURCHASED OPTION ARM LOANS FROM THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATORS, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THOSE ENTITIES AIDED AND ABETTED THE ORIGINAL LENDERS’ ALLEGED VIOLATIONS. CLASSES HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED IN THREE OF THE ACTIONS. IN ONE OF THE CERTIFIED CLASS ACTIONS, THE FIRM HAS MOVED FOR DECERTIFICATION OF THE CLASS AND FOR SUMMARY

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS RELATING TO ITS PRACTICES IN POSTING DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS TO CUSTOMERS’ DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE FIRM IMPROPERLY RE-ORDERED DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE HIGHEST AMOUNT TO THE LOWEST AMOUNT BEFORE PROCESSING THESE TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO GENERATE UNWARRANTED OVERDRAFT FEES. PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT THE FIRM SHOULD HAVE PROCESSED SUCH TRANSACTIONS IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE AUTHORIZED. PLAINTIFFS SEEK THE DISGORGEMENT OF ALL OVERDRAFT FEES PAID TO THE FIRM BY PLAINTIFFS SINCE APPROXIMATELY 2003 AS A RESULT OF THE RE-ORDERING OF DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE FIRM HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL BANKS IN MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA.

PETTERS AND CERTAIN AFFILIATED ENTITIES (COLLECTIVELY, “PETTERS”) AND THE POLAROID CORPORATION. THE PRINCIPAL ACTIONS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY A COURT-APPOINTED RECEIVER FOR PETTERS AND THE TRUSTEES IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS FOR THREE PETTERS ENTITIES. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY SEEK TO AVOID, ON FRAUDULENT TRANSFER AND PREFERENCE GROUNDS, CERTAIN PURPORTED TRANSFERS IN CONNECTION WITH (I) THE 2005 ACQUISITION BY PETTERS OF POLAROID, WHICH AT THE TIME WAS MAJORITY-OWNED BY OEP; (II) TWO CREDIT FACILITIES THAT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ENTERED INTO WITH POLAROID; AND (III) A CREDIT LINE AND INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS HELD BY PETTERS. THE ACTIONS COLLECTIVELY SEEK RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY

$450 MILLION

SECURITIES LENDING LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. WAS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION ASSERTING ERISA AND OTHER CLAIMS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BROUGHT BY PARTICIPANTS IN THE FIRM’S SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESS.

WASHINGTON MUTUAL LITIGATIONS.

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO WASHINGTON MUTUAL’S FAILURE ARE PENDING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND INCLUDE A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY, INITIALLY AGAINST THE FDIC, ASSERTING AN ESTIMATED

$6 BILLION

$10 BILLION

IN DAMAGES BASED UPON ALLEGED BREACH OF VARIOUS MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS AND ALLEGED VIOLATION OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES GIVEN BY CERTAIN WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. (“WMI”) SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. THE CASE INCLUDES ASSERTIONS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY HAVE ASSUMED LIABILITIES FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS. THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED AS PREMATURE MOTIONS BY THE FIRM AND THE FDIC THAT SOUGHT A RULING ON WHETHER THE FDIC RETAINED LIABILITY FOR DEUTSCHE BANK’S CLAIMS. DISCOVERY IS UNDERWAY.

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE WAS SUED IN AN ACTION ORIGINALLY FILED IN STATE COURT IN TEXAS (THE “TEXAS ACTION”) BY CERTAIN HOLDERS OF WMI COMMON STOCK AND DEBT OF WMI AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK WHO SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ALLEGING THAT JPMORGAN CHASE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK FROM THE FDIC AT A PRICE THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY TOO LOW. THE TEXAS ACTION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHICH ULTIMATELY GRANTED JPMORGAN CHASE’S AND THE FDIC’S MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, BUT THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURT’S DISMISSAL AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. PLAINTIFFS, WHO SUE NOW ONLY AS HOLDERS OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK DEBT FOLLOWING THEIR VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL OF CLAIMS BROUGHT AS HOLDERS OF WMI COMMON STOCK AND DEBT, HAVE FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT JPMORGAN CHASE CAUSED THE CLOSURE OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK AND DAMAGED THEM BY CAUSING THEIR BONDS ISSUED BY WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK, WHICH HAD A TOTAL FACE VALUE OF

$38 MILLION

, TO LOSE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR VALUE. JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE FDIC MOVED TO DISMISS THIS ACTION AND THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED THE CASE EXCEPT AS TO THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM THAT THE FIRM TORTIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH THE PLAINTIFFS’ BOND CONTRACTS WITH WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANK PRIOR TO ITS CLOSURE.

IN VIEW OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE MATTERS PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH CONFIDENCE WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOMES OF

THE CURRENTLY PENDING MATTERS, THE TIMING OF THEIR ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OR THE EVENTUAL LOSSES, FINES, PENALTIES OR IMPACT RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION RESERVES, THAT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FIRM NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES IT HAS CURRENTLY ACCRUED; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASE’S OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF JPMORGAN CHASE’S INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

ALT-A LENDING CHARACTERISTICS MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (I) LIMITED DOCUMENTATION; (II) A HIGH COMBINED LOAN-TO-VALUE (“CLTV”) RATIO; (III) LOANS SECURED BY NON-OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES; OR (IV) A DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO ABOVE NORMAL LIMITS. A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF THE FIRM’S ALT-A LOANS ARE THOSE WHERE A BORROWER DOES NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF HIS OR HER ASSETS OR THE AMOUNT OR SOURCE OF HIS OR HER INCOME.

OPTION ARMS

THE OPTION ARM REAL ESTATE LOAN PRODUCT IS AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN THAT PROVIDES THE BORROWER WITH THE OPTION EACH MONTH TO MAKE A FULLY AMORTIZING, INTEREST-ONLY OR MINIMUM PAYMENT. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT ON AN OPTION ARM LOAN IS BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED DURING THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. THIS INTRODUCTORY RATE IS USUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE FULLY INDEXED RATE. THE FULLY INDEXED RATE IS CALCULATED USING AN INDEX RATE PLUS A MARGIN. ONCE THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD ENDS, THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON THE LOAN INCREASES TO THE FULLY INDEXED RATE AND ADJUSTS MONTHLY TO REFLECT MOVEMENTS IN THE INDEX. THE MINIMUM PAYMENT IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO COVER INTEREST ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR MONTH, AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IS DEFERRED AND ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN. OPTION ARM LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT RECAST, WHICH CONVERTS THE LOAN TO A VARIABLE-RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN UPON MEETING SPECIFIED LOAN BALANCE AND ANNIVERSARY DATE TRIGGERS.

PRIME

PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS ARE MADE TO BORROWERS WITH GOOD CREDIT RECORDS AND A MONTHLY INCOME AT LEAST THREE TO FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THEIR MONTHLY HOUSING EXPENSE (MORTGAGE PAYMENTS PLUS TAXES AND OTHER DEBT PAYMENTS).

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES.

REPRESENTS UNVESTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS CONTAINING NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS (COLLECTIVELY, “DIVIDENDS”), WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION USING THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTS RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ENTITLE THE RECIPIENTS TO RECEIVE NONFORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD ON A BASIS EQUIVALENT TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK. THESE UNVESTED AWARDS MEET THE DEFINITION OF PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD, ALL EARNINGS (DISTRIBUTED AND UNDISTRIBUTED) ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH CLASS OF COMMON STOCK AND PARTICIPATING SECURITIES, BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS.

PERSONAL BANKERS.

RETAIL BRANCH OFFICE PERSONNEL WHO ACQUIRE, RETAIN AND EXPAND NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS BY ASSESSING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND RECOMMENDING AND SELLING APPROPRIATE BANKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS SUCH AS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER APPLICABLE OFF-BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE

RISK-WEIGHTED BY MULTIPLYING THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT BY THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT CONVERSION FACTOR TO DETERMINE THE ON-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EQUIVALENT AMOUNT, WHICH IS THEN RISK-WEIGHTED BASED ON THE SAME FACTORS USED FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ALSO INCORPORATE A MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK RELATED TO APPLICABLE TRADING ASSETS-DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES. THE RESULTING RISK-WEIGHTED VALUES FOR EACH OF THE RISK CATEGORIES ARE THEN AGGREGATED TO DETERMINE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

IN PRESENTING MANAGED RESULTS, THE TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS PRESENTED IN THE MANAGED RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES; THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO TAX-EXEMPT ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTEREST INCOME FROM ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED ON SUCH LOANS ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT ACTUALLY WAS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THIS DATA FOR THE YEARS SPECIFIED. THE CHANGE IN FOREGONE INTEREST INCOME FROM

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL’S (“FFIEC”) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK.

THE REPORTING OF COUNTRY EXPOSURE UNDER THE FFIEC BANK REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERS FROM THE FIRM’S INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH AS DESCRIBED IN COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

170–173

. ONE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS THE FFIEC AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE DOMICILE (LEGAL RESIDENCE) OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER, OR GUARANTOR, WHILE THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH IS BASED ON WHERE THE ASSETS OF THE OBLIGOR, COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR GUARANTOR ARE LOCATED OR WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE REVENUE IS DERIVED. OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND THE FIRM’S CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE FFIEC AMOUNTS DO NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING.

•

THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL RECEIVED FOR SECURITIES FINANCING EXPOSURES;

•

THE NETTING OF CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES RECEIVED FOR LENDING EXPOSURES. THE FFIEC GUIDELINES REQUIRE RISK

SHIFTING OF LENDING EXPOSURE COLLATERALIZED BY MARKETABLE SECURITIES TO THE COUNTRY OF DOMICILE OF THE ISSUER OF THE SECURITIES, AND RISK SHIFTING TO THE U.S. FOR CASH COLLATERAL;

•

THE NETTING OF LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS ACROSS ISSUERS IN THE SAME COUNTRY; AND

•

THE NETTING OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD. THE FFIEC GUIDELINES REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF THE GROSS NOTIONAL OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PROTECTION SOLD AND DOES NOT PERMIT NETTING FOR CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROTECTION ON THE SAME UNDERLYING REFERENCE ENTITY.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DIFFERENCES, THE FFIEC REQUIRES THAT NET LOCAL COUNTRY ASSETS BE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION).

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S TOTAL CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE TENDS TO FLUCTUATE GREATLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE AT YEAR-END TENDS TO BE A FUNCTION OF TIMING RATHER THAN REPRESENTING A CONSISTENT TREND. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE

’S COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

170–173.
