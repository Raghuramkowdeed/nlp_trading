EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2004, BANK ONE CORPORATION (BANK ONE) MERGED WITH AND INTO JPMORGAN CHASE &

CO. (THE MERGER), PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER DATED JANUARY 14, 2004. AS A RESULT

OF THE MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF COMMON STOCK OF BANK ONE WAS CONVERTED IN A

STOCK-FOR-STOCK EXCHANGE INTO 1.32 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE

OR THE FIRM). THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE PURCHASE

PRICE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WAS $58.5 BILLION.

BANK ONES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS RESULTS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2004.

THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECT SIX MONTHS

OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED FIRM AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE; THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR ALL OTHER PERIODS PRIOR TO 2004 REFLECT ONLY THE OPERATIONS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN

CHASE.

OVERVIEW

JPMORGAN CHASE IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968. JPMORGAN

CHASE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH $1.2 TRILLION IN

ASSETS, $107 BILLION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

(JPMORGAN CHASE BANK), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION WITH BRANCHES IN 17 STATES, AND CHASE BANK

USA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (CHASE USA), A NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATION THAT IS THE FIRMS CREDIT

CARD-ISSUING BANK. JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL NONBANK SUBSIDIARY IS J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.

(JPMSI), ITS U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM. THE BANK AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

OPERATE NATIONALLY AS WELL AS THROUGH OVERSEAS BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES

AND SUBSIDIARY FOREIGN BANKS.

THE FIRMS WEBSITE IS WWW.JPMORGANCHASE.COM. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE, THROUGH

ITS WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON

FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR

SECTION 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER IT

ELECTRONICALLY FILES SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISHES SUCH MATERIAL TO, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (THE SEC). THE FIRM HAS ADOPTED, AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE, A CODE OF ETHICS FOR ITS

CHAIRMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER AND OTHER

SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASES ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED, FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, INTO SIX BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY &

SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT) AND CORPORATE, WHICH INCLUDES ITS PRIVATE EQUITY

AND TREASURY BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS CORPORATE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLIENT BASES IS

PROVIDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(MD&A), BEGINNING ON PAGE 34, AND IN NOTE 31 ON PAGE 130.

COMPETITION

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES,

HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES,

E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

ADVISORY COMPANIES. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH THESE OTHER FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO THE

QUALITY AND RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED AND THE TYPES OF CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRIES

AND GEOGRAPHIES SERVED. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF ITS GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCTS, JPMORGAN CHASE

COMPETES GLOBALLY; WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS, THE FIRM COMPETES ON A REGIONAL BASIS. JPMORGAN CHASES

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS UPON THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ITS PRODUCTS, THE DEGREE TO

WHICH THE FEATURES OF ITS PRODUCTS APPEAL TO CUSTOMERS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FIRM IS ABLE TO

MEET ITS CLIENTS OBJECTIVES OR NEEDS. THE FIRMS ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS UPON ITS ABILITY

TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ITS PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER PERSONNEL, AND ON ITS REPUTATION.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION AND CONVERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS, AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE MERGED.

THIS CONVERGENCE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE GAINING GREATER CAPITAL AND OTHER RESOURCES, SUCH AS A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMPETITION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE INTENSE AS

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO COMPETE WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY BE LARGER OR BETTER

CAPITALIZED, OR THAT MAY HAVE A STRONGER LOCAL PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

CERTAIN RISKS RELATING TO THE FIRMS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, SEE THE RISK FACTORS ON PAGE 4.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW,

INCLUDING THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED (THE BHCA). JPMORGAN CHASE ELECTED TO

BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AS OF MARCH 13, 2000 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE 1999

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA).

UNDER REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD), IF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY CEASES TO

MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL OR MANAGEMENT STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY IMPOSE CORRECTIVE

CAPITAL AND/OR MANAGERIAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND PLACE LIMITATIONS ON

ITS ABILITY TO CONDUCT THE BROADER FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURE OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IF THE DEFICIENCIES PERSIST. THE REGULATIONS ALSO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY

RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA), THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MUST PROHIBIT THE

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ENGAGING IN ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES

OTHER THAN THOSE

1

PART I

PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, THE DEPOSITORY-INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE MET THE CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND

CRA REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO PERMIT THE FIRM TO CONDUCT THE BROADER ACTIVITIES PERMITTED UNDER

GLBA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

REGULATION BY FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD UNDER GLBA.

UNDER GLBAS SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ACTS AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR, AND CERTAIN OF JPMORGAN CHASES

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED DIRECTLY BY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES BASED UPON THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES

OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA ARE REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE FIRMS SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY ACTIVITIES ARE

REGULATED BY THE SEC, AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE

SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE THAT ARE NATIONAL BANKS. NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE

NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE LIMITATIONS. THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE PAID BY NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH

AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, IS LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED UNDER A

RECENT EARNINGS TEST AND AN UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST. UNDER THE RECENT EARNINGS TEST, A DIVIDEND

MAY NOT BE PAID IF THE TOTAL OF ALL DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY A BANK IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS IN EXCESS

OF THE CURRENT YEARS NET INCOME COMBINED WITH THE RETAINED NET INCOME OF THE TWO PRECEDING YEARS,

UNLESS THE NATIONAL BANK OBTAINS THE APPROVAL OF THE OCC. UNDER THE UNDIVIDED PROFITS TEST, A

DIVIDEND MAY NOT BE PAID IN EXCESS OF A BANKS UNDIVIDED PROFITS. SEE NOTE 23 ON PAGE 121 FOR THE

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, AT JANUARY 1, 2006 AND

2005, TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THEIR BANKING REGULATORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OCC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (THE FDIC) HAVE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION, PAYMENT OF A

DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATION.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ADOPTED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

GUIDELINES THAT REQUIRE THE FIRMS CAPITAL-TO-ASSETS RATIOS TO MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING ASSETS AND SPECIFIED OFF-BALANCE SHEET

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INTO FOUR WEIGHTED CATEGORIES, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL BEING REQUIRED

FOR THE CATEGORIES PERCEIVED AS REPRESENTING GREATER RISK. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, CAPITAL IS DIVIDED

INTO TWO TIERS: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. THE AMOUNT OF TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY NOT EXCEED THE

AMOUNT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. TOTAL CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. UNDER THE

GUIDELINES, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS) OF 8% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 4%.

TIER 1 COMPONENTS.

CAPITAL SURPLUS, COMMON STOCK AND NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK ARE

THE MOST BASIC COMPONENTS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO PERMITS CUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL BUT ONLY UP TO CERTAIN LIMITS. ON

MARCH 1, 2005, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ISSUED A FINAL RULE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL 11,

2005, THAT CONTINUES THE INCLUSION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO

STRICTER QUANTITATIVE LIMITS AND REVISED QUALITATIVE STANDARDS, AND BROADENS THE DEFINITION OF

RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS. THE RULE PROVIDES FOR A FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. AS AN

INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE RULES LIMITATION ON

RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, TO 15% OF TOTAL CORE

CAPITAL ELEMENTS, NET OF GOODWILL LESS ANY ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

JPMORGAN CHASES RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS WERE 16.5% OF TOTAL CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 15% LIMIT BY THE MARCH 31, 2009, IMPLEMENTATION

DATE. TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY ISSUED BY A SPECIAL-PURPOSE TRUST ESTABLISHED AND

OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE TO THE PUBLIC OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

ARE LENT TO THE FIRM FOR AT LEAST 30 (BUT NOT MORE THAN 50) YEARS. THE INTERCOMPANY NOTE THAT

EVIDENCES THIS LOAN PROVIDES THAT THE INTEREST PAYMENTS BY JPMORGAN CHASE ON THE NOTE MAY BE

DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. DURING THE PERIOD OF ANY SUCH DEFERRAL, NO PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS MAY

BE MADE ON ANY OUTSTANDING JPMORGAN CHASE PREFERRED OR COMMON STOCK OR ON THE OUTSTANDING TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED TO THE PUBLIC. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS IMPLEMENTATION OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

(FIN 46), JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE TRUSTS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET.

TIER 2 COMPONENTS.

LONG-TERM SUBORDINATED DEBT (GENERALLY HAVING AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF 1012

YEARS) IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF JPMORGAN CHASES TIER 2 CAPITAL.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES. THE

LEVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS (NET OF THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOAN LOSSES, GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS). THE MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO IS 3% FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRONG UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GUIDELINES OR WHICH HAVE

IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK. OTHER BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES MUST HAVE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4%. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE EXPECTED

TO MAINTAIN RATIOS WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUM LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITION, RISK

PROFILE AND GROWTH PLANS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, CERTAIN

RISKS ARISING FROM NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RISKS AS

IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING AN INSTITUTIONS OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY. OTHER FACTORS

TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY FEDERAL REGULATORS INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE; LIQUIDITY, FUNDING

AND MARKET RISK; THE QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS; THE QUALITY OF LOANS AND INVESTMENTS; THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF LOAN AND INVESTMENT POLICIES; AND MANAGEMENTS OVERALL ABILITY TO MONITOR AND

CONTROL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS PRESENTED BY CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

AND NON-TRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES INCORPORATE A

MEASURE FOR MARKET RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY ACTIVITIES AND IN THE TRADING OF DEBT AND

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE MARKET RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WITH LARGE

TRADING ACTIVITIES (SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE) TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL FOR MARKET RISK IN AN AMOUNT

CALCULATED BY USING THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS OWN INTERNAL VALUE-AT-RISK MODELS (SUBJECT TO

PARAMETERS SET BY THE REGULATORS).

THE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES FOLLOW THE

CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED A

REVISION TO THE ACCORD (BASEL II). U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING

THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

2

JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN THE U.S. BY

EMPLOYING INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS

U.S. BANK SUPERVISORS THAT INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY STANDARDS. JPMORGAN

CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED TIMELINES WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II

RULES.

FDICIA.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991 (FDICIA) PROVIDES A

FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PARENT HOLDING

COMPANIES, BY THEIR FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS; AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT REQUIRES THE RELEVANT

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THAT INSTITUTION DOES NOT MEET CERTAIN CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS.

SUPERVISORY ACTIONS BY THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE

ACTION RULES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON AN INSTITUTIONS CLASSIFICATION WITHIN FIVE CAPITAL CATEGORIES.

THE REGULATIONS APPLY ONLY TO BANKS AND NOT TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE;

HOWEVER, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED PURSUANT TO GLBA, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS

AUTHORIZED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, BASED UPON THE UNDERCAPITALIZED

STATUS OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY BANKING INSTITUTIONS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RELATING TO

AN UNDERCAPITALIZED BANKING INSTITUTION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERCAPITALIZED SUBSIDIARY AND MIGHT BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES FOR

FAILURE TO FULFILL ITS COMMITMENTS ON THAT GUARANTEE.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

FDICIA ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO ESTABLISH A RISK-BASED ASSESSMENT

SYSTEM FOR FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. UNDER THE FDICS RISK-BASED INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSESSMENT SYSTEM,

EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO ONE OF NINE RISK CLASSIFICATIONS BASED UPON CERTAIN

CAPITAL AND SUPERVISORY MEASURES AND, DEPENDING UPON ITS CLASSIFICATION, IS ASSESSED INSURANCE

PREMIUMS ON ITS DEPOSITS. IN FEBRUARY 2006, A BILL INTENDED TO REFORM THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE SYSTEM

WAS ENACTED. THIS LAW WILL GENERALLY NOT BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE FDIC ISSUES FINAL REGULATIONS

IMPLEMENTING THE NEW LAW. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FULLY ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE LAW UNTIL SUCH FINAL

REGULATIONS ARE PROMULGATED.

POWERS OF THE FDIC UPON INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS INCURRED OR EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN

CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FDIC-INSURED INSTITUTION UNDER COMMON CONTROL, WITH SUCH INSTITUTION BEING

IN DEFAULT OR IN DANGER OF DEFAULT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CROSS-GUARANTEE LIABILITY). AN

FDIC CROSS-GUARANTEE CLAIM AGAINST A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR IN RIGHT OF

PAYMENT TO CLAIMS OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON ITS

INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE

BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE

ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO

OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASES SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS

UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THOSE BANKS TO INVESTORS (REFERENCED BELOW AS PUBLIC

NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF

THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION,

INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTE-HOLDERS, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE

INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD

BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS OF ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE FIRM THAT IS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH

AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK OR CHASE USA, THE PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND

COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE DEPOSITORS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT.

THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (PATRIOT ACT) SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENS EXISTING

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES;

IMPOSES NEW COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS; CREATES NEW CRIMES AND PENALTIES; COMPELS THE

PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS LOCATED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THOSE OF

NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CORRESPONDENT RELATIONSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES; AND CLARIFIES

THE SAFE HARBOR FROM CIVIL LIABILITY TO CUSTOMERS. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY HAS

ISSUED A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS THAT FURTHER CLARIFY THE PATRIOT ACTS REQUIREMENTS OR PROVIDE MORE

SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON THEIR APPLICATION.

THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS DEFINED, TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS. THE ACT REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

MAINTAIN CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS FOR NON-U.S. INSTITUTIONS, OR PERSONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PRIVATE

BANKING FOR NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH, APPROPRIATE,

SPECIFIC AND, WHERE NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY

DESIGNED TO DETECT AND REPORT INSTANCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING THROUGH THOSE ACCOUNTS. JPMORGAN CHASE

BELIEVES ITS PROGRAMS SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATRIOT ACT. BANK REGULATORS ARE FOCUSING

THEIR EXAMINATIONS ON ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE, AND JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO ENHANCE

ITS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS.

OTHER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION.

UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT RESOURCES

TO SUPPORT THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MIGHT NOT DO SO ABSENT SUCH POLICY.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE GLBA PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY

VARIOUS REGULATORS, GLBA PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING

COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS

TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF

THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

ANY LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF

PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATORY AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK AT A CERTAIN LEVEL WOULD BE ASSUMED

BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

3

PART I

THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL

LAW ON EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO, AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH, THE FIRM AND CERTAIN OTHER

AFFILIATES, AND ON INVESTMENTS IN STOCK OR SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND THOSE AFFILIATES. THESE

RESTRICTIONS PREVENT JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER AFFILIATES FROM BORROWING FROM A BANK SUBSIDIARY

UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.

THE FIRMS BANK AND CERTAIN OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION BY VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES (SOME OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED FUNCTIONAL

REGULATORS UNDER GLBA). JPMORGAN CHASES NATIONAL BANK SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE BANK

AND CHASE USA, ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE OCC AND, IN CERTAIN MATTERS, BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD AND THE FDIC. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY AGENCY

GENERALLY INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE RELEVANT BANKS

BUSINESS AND CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE IMPOSITION OF PERIODIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND

LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS AND OTHER POWERS. THE FIRM ALSO CONDUCTS SECURITIES UNDERWRITING,

DEALING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITIES THROUGH JPMSI AND OTHER BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH

ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

(NASD). JPMSI IS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE). THE OPERATIONS OF JPMORGAN

CHASES MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SEC. THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH

THE NON-U.S. BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE

MAY ENGAGE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD. THOSE NON-U.S.

BRANCHES AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF

THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

THE ACTIVITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE USA AS CONSUMER LENDERS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE TRUTH-IN-LENDING, THE EQUAL CREDIT

OPPORTUNITY, THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING, THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE AND THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS

TRANSFER ACTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE LAWS. THESE STATUTES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAKING,

ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION OF CONSUMER LOANS AND ON THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT NEED TO BE MADE

IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LOANS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY GLBA, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE

REQUIRED PERIODICALLY TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THE FIRMS POLICIES AND PRACTICES WITH

RESPECT TO (1) THE SHARING OF NON-PUBLIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION WITH JPMORGAN CHASE AFFILIATES AND

OTHERS; AND (2) THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF THAT INFORMATION. UNDER GLBA, RETAIL CUSTOMERS

ALSO MUST BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF INFORMATION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

NON-AFFILIATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN GLBA.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS RELATING TO THE FIRMS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, SEE RISK FACTORS

BELOW.

NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

FOR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF TOTAL REVENUE, TOTAL EXPENSE, INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE

AND NET INCOME, SEE NOTE 30 ON PAGE 129. FOR A DISCUSSION OF NON-U.S. LOANS, SEE NOTE 11 ON PAGE

MD&A ON PAGE 70, LOAN PORTFOLIO ON PAGE 142 AND CROSS-BORDER

OUTSTANDINGS ON PAGE 143.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW OR

ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER OF THE FIRMS REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE

SEC ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS OR RESULTS. THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY

DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT MAY FACE THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF EQUITY PRICES; INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITIES

PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; INFLATION; AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECT THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY

BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO MAY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS. A MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS

THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUES IT

RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY WILL REDUCE

TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER TRADING REVENUES. HIGHER INTEREST

RATES OR WEAKNESS IN THE MARKETS ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS

THE FIRM MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR INVESTORS

TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND

EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS

HELD BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY

POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS; AND OTHER ECONOMIC AND

BUSINESS FACTORS. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUES RELATING TO ITS TRADING WILL EXPERIENCE

VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR

OTHER CONDITIONS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN

IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS MANAGED BY THE FIRM,

WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUES. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET

DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD

RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THE

FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS MAY BE

AFFECTED BY BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IN A POOR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT

MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER

OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH CAN

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT SUCH BUSINESSES AND THE FIRM.

4

SUCH CONDITIONS INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

CERTAIN CHANGES TO THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR

INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN CONSUMERS

CREDIT QUALITY COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO

CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES

LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY-DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A

WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE

FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES,

CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE

FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A

VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH

OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO

PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF ITS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING

OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR

THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION

MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, WHICH INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSES, OR WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE

OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE

BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

THE FIRM HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER

BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED

POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED

TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; OR THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF

THE COMBINED ENTITY. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES

INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS

WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, AS

WELL AS WITH EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASES MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS OR THAT ANY BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND WILL RESULT IN ALL OF THE POSITIVE

BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ITS PAST AND ANY

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, THERE IS THE RISK THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS A LARGE NUMBER OF INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE

FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF A

FIRM EMPLOYEE CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN

ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF

OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAK-DOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN

SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND

REGULATORY INTERVENTION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE

WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR

ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES OR NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANE KATRINA, OR EVENTS

ARISING FROM LOCAL OR REGIONAL POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE

TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT

SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IN ADDITION THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS

CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING THE

FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO

LITIGATION OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD COMMONLY

KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. IN THE PAST MANY EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES AND CAPITAL AND

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AS WELL AS LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF

LOSS FROM VARIOUS UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS,

EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO

NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN THE SECURITIES OF CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS,

INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO

NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS

COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS (PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS) ARE USUALLY

SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE

FIRM WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ARISING FROM ITS NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES OR

OPERATIONS.

5

PART I

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE CONDUCT OF ITS

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ITS REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS

BUSINESS.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACT WITH ITS COUNTER-PARTIES COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED. THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR TO

APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD CAUSE

HARM TO THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

ETHICAL ISSUES, MONEY-LAUNDERING, PRIVACY, RECORD-KEEPING, SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES, AND THE

PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN

ITS PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD MAKE THE FIRMS CLIENTS

UNWILLING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FIRM, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

SUBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH

IT CAN GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

CERTAIN REGULATORS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER IN REVIEWING THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS AND APPROVING ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED REGULATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY, OFTEN REQUIRING

ADDITIONAL FIRM RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM EXPANDS ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS

ACTIVITIES WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASING RANGE OF NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT WILL

LIKELY IMPOSE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE IS

SUBJECT, OR THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE INTERPRETED OR ENFORCED, WILL NOT

HAVE A NEGATIVE AFFECT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER

LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY

REGULATORY AGENCIES. THESE OR OTHER FUTURE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN

JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR

CAUSE IT SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

ITS BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES ARE ITS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE

TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION,

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE AFFECT ON

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL OR OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY

AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND

INVESTING. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND

COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH

CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ITS RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS

TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MADE UP OF VARIOUS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE

THE FIRMS RISK EXPOSURE. TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT

RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND REPUTATION RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK

AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK TO

MANAGE RISK, INCLUDING SUCH FRAMEWORKS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, WILL BE EFFECTIVE UNDER ALL

CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. IF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM

COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

A COMPROMISE TO THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY COULD THEREFORE HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRM. POTENTIAL

CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE

DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS.

THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MAINTAINING ITS LIQUIDITY, AS A REDUCTION IN THE

FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A CREDIT RATINGS

DOWNGRADE, DEPENDING ON ITS SEVERITY, COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT ACCESS TO

CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS OR COLLATERAL POSTING, AND PERMIT TERMINATION OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTS MATERIAL TO THE FIRM.

FUTURE EVENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE ANTICIPATED BY JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS

AND ESTIMATES, WHICH MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE LOAN LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO

FUTURE LITIGATION, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. SHOULD

THE FIRMS DETERMINED VALUES FOR SUCH ITEMS PROVE SUBSTANTIALLY INACCURATE THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE

UNEXPECTED LOSSES WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENTS

NONE.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

THE HEADQUARTERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY AT 270 PARK AVENUE, WHICH IS A

50-STORY BANK AND OFFICE BUILDING OWNED BY JPMORGAN CHASE. THIS LOCATION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 1.3

MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE. IN TOTAL, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS OR LEASES APPROXIMATELY 12.3 MILLION

SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE SPACE AND RETAIL SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO OWN OR LEASE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL

FACILITIES IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (5.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET), HOUSTON AND DALLAS, TEXAS (6.8 MILLION

SQUARE FEET), COLUMBUS, OHIO (2.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET), NEWARK AND WILMINGTON, DELAWARE (2.2

MILLION SQUARE FEET), PHOENIX, ARIZONA (1.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET), TAMPA, FLORIDA (1.0 MILLION

SQUARE FEET), JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY (1.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET), AND INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA (900

THOUSAND SQUARE FEET).

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE OWNS OR LEASES FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (2.7

MILLION SQUARE FEET) AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES (2.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET).

IN ADDITION, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OCCUPY OFFICES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OPERATIONAL FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF OWNERSHIP AND LEASEHOLD

AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING 2,641 RETAIL BRANCHES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PROPERTIES OCCUPIED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE ARE USED ACROSS ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOR CORPORATE PURPOSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT AND PROJECTED SPACE REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF ITS EXCESS PREMISES OR THAT IT WILL NOT INCUR

CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS. SUCH DISPOSITION COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN PERIOD. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OCCUPANCY EXPENSE, SEE THE

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION ON PAGES 2930.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ENRON LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE INVOLVED IN A

NUMBER OF LAWSUITS ARISING OUT OF ITS BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENRON CORP. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(ENRON). SEVERAL ACTIONS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS, AGAINST THE FIRM, HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, INCLUDING

ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY ENRONS BANKRUPTCY ESTATE. IN ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED,

THE FIRM HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LEAD CLASS ACTION LITIGATION BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF

THE PURCHASERS OF ENRON SECURITIES, CAPTIONED

NEWBY V. ENRON CORP.

, FOR $2.2 BILLION

(PRETAX). THE SETTLEMENT IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS. THE

NEWBY

SETTLEMENT DOES NOT RESOLVE ENRON-RELATED ACTIONS FILED

SEPARATELY BY PLAINTIFFS WHO OPT OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION, OR BY CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE

ASSERTING CLAIMS NOT COVERED BY THAT ACTION.

THE REMAINING ENRON-RELATED ACTIONS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

WERE LENDERS OR CLAIM TO BE SUCCESSORS-IN-INTEREST TO LENDERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ENRON CREDIT

FACILITIES SYNDICATED BY THE FIRM; INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BY ENRON INVESTORS,

CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES; AND THIRD-PARTY ACTIONS BROUGHT BY DEFENDANTS IN ENRON-RELATED CASES,

ALLEGING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE AND MANY OTHER DEFENDANTS. FACT

DISCOVERY IN THESE ACTIONS IS MOSTLY COMPLETE. PLAINTIFFS IN TWO OF THE BANK LENDER CASES HAVE

MOVED FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT, WHICH THE FIRM WILL OPPOSE.

IN A PURPORTED, CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BY JPMORGAN CHASE STOCKHOLDERS ALLEGING THAT THE

FIRM ISSUED FALSE AND MISLEADING PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER PUBLIC DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ENRON IN

VIOLATION OF SECTION 10(B) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND

RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

DISMISSED THE LAWSUIT IN ITS ENTIRETY WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN MARCH 2005. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED

COMPLAINT IN MAY 2005. THE FIRM HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT, AND THE MOTION HAS BEEN

SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOR DECISION.

IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRMS

401(K) PLAN ARE ALLEGING CLAIMS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) FOR

ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND NEGLIGENCE BY JPMORGAN CHASE, ITS DIRECTORS AND NAMED

OFFICERS. IN AUGUST 2005, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

DENIED PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND ORDERED SOME OF PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS DISMISSED.

A PETITION HAS BEEN FILED BY THE PLAINTIFFS SEEKING REVIEW OF THE DENIAL OF CLASS CERTIFICATION IN

THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT, WHICH PETITION REMAINS PENDING. THE FIRM

HAS ALSO MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THIS ERISA LAWSUIT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

IPO ALLOCATION LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN MAY 2001, JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SECURITIES

SUBSIDIARIES WERE NAMED, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY, AS DEFENDANTS

IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THESE SUITS ALLEGE IMPROPRIETIES IN THE ALLOCATION OF STOCK IN

VARIOUS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, INCLUDING SOME OFFERINGS FOR WHICH A JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITY SERVED AS AN

UNDERWRITER. THE SUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST LAWS ARISING FROM ALLEGED

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS IN REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND PROSPECTUSES FOR THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS) AND ALLEGED MARKET MANIPULATION WITH RESPECT TO AFTERMARKET TRANSACTIONS

IN THE OFFERED SECURITIES. THE SECURITIES LAWSUITS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MISREPRESENTATION

AND MARKET MANIPULATION OF THE AFTERMARKET TRADING FOR THESE OFFERINGS BY TYING ALLOCATIONS OF

SHARES IN IPOS TO UNDISCLOSED EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS PAID TO JPMORGAN CHASE AND TO REQUIRED

AFTERMARKET PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED ALLOCATIONS OF SHARES IN THE RESPECTIVE

IPOS, AS WELL AS ALLEGATIONS OF MISLEADING ANALYST REPORTS. THE ANTITRUST LAWSUITS ALLEGE AN

ILLEGAL CONSPIRACY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS, IN EXCHANGE FOR IPO ALLOCATIONS, TO PAY UNDISCLOSED AND

EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS AND TO MAKE AFTERMARKET PURCHASES OF THE IPO SECURITIES AT A PRICE HIGHER

THAN THE OFFERING PRICE AS A PRECONDITION TO RECEIVING ALLOCATIONS. THE SECURITIES CASES WERE ALL

ASSIGNED TO ONE JUDGE FOR COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND THE ANTITRUST CASES WERE ALL

ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER JUDGE. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2003, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND

OTHERS TO DISMISS THE SECURITIES COMPLAINTS. ON OCTOBER 13, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART

PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASSES IN SIX FOCUS CASES IN THE SECURITIES LITIGATION. ON JUNE

30, 2005, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT GRANTED THE UNDERWRITER

DEFENDANTS PETITION FOR PERMISSION TO APPEAL THE DISTRICT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION DECISION,

AND THE APPEAL CURRENTLY IS BEING BRIEFED. THE SECOND CIRCUIT LIKELY WILL HEAR ORAL ARGUMENT

SOMETIME DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2006.

IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 15, 2005, THE COURT IN THE SECURITIES CASES PRELIMINARILY APPROVED A

PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AGAINST 298 OF THE ISSUER DEFENDANTS IN THESE CASES AND A

FAIRNESS HEARING ON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS NOW SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 24, 2006. PURSUANT TO THE

PROPOSED ISSUER SETTLEMENT, THE INSURERS FOR THE SETTLING ISSUER DEFENDANTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

(1) AGREED TO GUARANTEE THAT THE PLAINTIFF CLASSES WILL RECOVER AT LEAST $1 BILLION FROM THE

UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS IN THE IPO SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST

7

PART I

CASES AND TO PAY ANY SHORTFALL, AND (2) CONDITIONALLY ASSIGNED TO THE PLAINTIFFS ANY CLAIMS

RELATED TO ANY EXCESS COMPENSATION ALLEGEDLY PAID TO THE UNDERWRITERS BY THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR

ALLOCATIONS OF STOCK IN THE OFFERINGS AT ISSUE IN THE IPO LITIGATION. JOSEPH P. LASALA, THE TRUSTEE

DESIGNATED BY PLAINTIFFS TO ACT AS ASSIGNEE OF SUCH ISSUER EXCESS COMPENSATION CLAIMS, FILED

COMPLAINTS PURPORTING TO ALLEGE STATE LAW CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN ISSUERS AGAINST JPMSI AND

OTHER UNDERWRITERS (THE 

LASALA

ACTIONS), TOGETHER WITH MOTIONS TO STAY PROCEEDINGS IN EACH CASE.

TO DATE, JPMSI IS A DEFENDANT IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE APPROXIMATELY 100 PENDING

LASALA

ACTIONS. ON

AUGUST 30, 2005, THE COURT STAYED UNTIL RESOLUTION OF THE PROPOSED ISSUER SETTLEMENT THE

LASALA

ACTIONS THEN PENDING AGAINST JPMSI AND OTHER UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS AT THAT TIME, AS WELL AS ALL

FUTURE-FILED

LASALA

ACTIONS PURSUANT TO THE PARTIES STIPULATION THAT THE COURTS DECISION WOULD

GOVERN STAY MOTIONS IN ALL FUTURE

LASALA

ACTIONS. ON OCTOBER 12, 2005, THE COURT GRANTED THE

UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS ONE

LASALA

ACTION, WHICH BY STIPULATION APPLIED TO THE

PARALLEL MOTIONS TO DISMISS IN ALL OTHER PENDING AND FUTURE-FILED

LASALA

ACTIONS. THE COURT DID,

HOWEVER, GRANT PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO REPLEAD AND NOTED THAT THE STAY OF THE

LASALA

ACTIONS REMAINS IN

EFFECT. PLAINTIFFS THEREAFTER FILED AMENDED COMPLAINTS IN THE LEAD AND OTHER

LASALA

ACTIONS IN

WHICH PLAINTIFFS ARE PURPORTEDLY SEEKING EQUITABLE RESTITUTION ON A BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY CLAIM

 A CLAIM THAT SOUGHT DAMAGES IN THE INITIAL

LASALA

COMPLAINTS AND WAS DISMISSED ON THE GROUND

THAT IT WAS TIME-BARRED. ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005, THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN THE LEAD

LASALA

ACTION AND  BY VIRTUE OF THE STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES

 THEREBY MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINTS IN ALL OTHER PENDING AND FUTURE-FILED

LASALA

ACTIONS. THE MOTION CURRENTLY IS BEING BRIEFED.

WITH RESPECT TO THE IPO ANTITRUST LAWSUITS, ON NOVEMBER 3, 2003, THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS

DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR

REHEARING EN BANC

IN THE SECOND CIRCUIT WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 11, 2006.

A WHOLLY SEPARATE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF IPO ISSUERS ALLEGING THAT

JPMSI AND OTHER UNDERWRITERS CONSPIRED TO FIX THEIR UNDERWRITING FEES IN IPOS IS IN DISCOVERY.

NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL ENTERPRISES LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, JPMORGAN

PARTNERS, BEACON GROUP, LLC AND THREE CURRENT OR FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN ACTIONS FILED IN OR TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (THE MDL LITIGATION). IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACTIONS, BANK

ONE, BANK ONE, N.A., AND BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. ARE ALSO NAMED AS DEFENDANTS. JPMORGAN CHASE

BANK AND BANK ONE, N.A. ARE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY THE UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TRUST

(UAT), A TRUST CREATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDITORS OF NATIONAL CENTURY FINANCIAL

ENTERPRISES, INC. (NCFE) AS A RESULT OF NCFES PLAN OF LIQUIDATION IN BANKRUPTCY. THESE ACTIONS

AROSE OUT OF THE NOVEMBER 2002 BANKRUPTCY OF NCFE. PRIOR TO BANKRUPTCY, NCFE PROVIDED FINANCING TO

VARIOUS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHOLLY-OWNED SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES, INCLUDING NPF VI AND

NPF XII, WHICH PURCHASED DISCOUNTED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE PAID UNDER THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE

PROGRAMS. NPF VI AND NPF XII FINANCED THE PURCHASES OF SUCH RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE

PLACEMENTS OF NOTES (NOTES) TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PLEDGED THE RECEIVABLES FOR, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THE REPAYMENT OF THE NOTES. IN THE MDL LITIGATION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK IS SUED IN ITS

ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF VI, WHICH ISSUED

APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN NOTES. BANK ONE, N.A. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR NPF

XII, WHICH ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION IN NOTES. THE THREE CURRENT OR FORMER FIRM EMPLOYEES ARE

SUED IN THEIR ROLES AS FORMER MEMBERS OF NCFES BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES).

JPMORGAN CHASE, JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND BEACON GROUP, LLC, ARE CLAIMED TO BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE FOR

THE ALLEGED ACTIONS OF THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES. BANC ONE CAPITAL MARKETS, INC. IS SUED IN ITS ROLE

AS CO-MANAGER FOR THREE NOTE OFFERINGS MADE BY NPF XII. OTHER DEFENDANTS INCLUDE THE FOUNDERS AND

KEY EXECUTIVES OF NCFE, ITS AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, AND RATING AGENCIES AND PLACEMENT AGENTS

THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO PURCHASED MORE THAN $2.7 BILLION IN ORIGINAL FACE AMOUNT OF

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED BY NCFE. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE TRUSTEES VIOLATED FIDUCIARY AND

CONTRACTUAL DUTIES, IMPROPERLY PERMITTED NCFE AND ITS AFFILIATES TO VIOLATE THE APPLICABLE

INDENTURES AND VIOLATED SECURITIES LAWS BY (AMONG OTHER THINGS) FAILING TO DISCLOSE THE TRUE NATURE

OF THE NCFE ARRANGEMENTS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES CONTROLLED THE

BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEES OF THE NCFE ENTITIES; WERE FULLY AWARE OR NEGLIGENT IN NOT KNOWING OF

NCFES ALLEGED MANIPULATION OF ITS BOOKS; AND ARE LIABLE FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE THEIR PURPORTED

KNOWLEDGE OF THE ALLEGED FRAUD TO THE PLAINTIFFS. PLAINTIFFS ALSO ALLEGE THAT BANC ONE CAPITAL

MARKETS, INC. IS LIABLE FOR COOPERATING IN THE SALE OF SECURITIES BASED UPON FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS. MOTIONS TO DISMISS ON BEHALF OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE ENTITIES, THE BANK ONE ENTITIES AND

THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. IN THE UAT ACTION, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND BANK ONE

ARE SUED IN THEIR ROLES AS INDENTURE TRUSTEES. CLAIMS ARE ASSERTED UNDER THE FEDERAL RACKETEER

INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO), THE OHIO CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND VARIOUS

COMMON-LAW CLAIMS. ON MARCH 31, 2005, MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE UAT ACTION WERE FILED ON BEHALF OF

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THESE MOTIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2006, THE JPMORGAN CHASE

ENTITIES, THE BANK ONE ENTITIES AND THE DEFENDANT EMPLOYEES REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE HOLDERS

OF $1.6 BILLION FACE VALUE OF NOTES (THE ARIZONA NOTEHOLDERS), AND REACHED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT

WITH THE UAT. THE SETTLEMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ENTRY OF CERTAIN ORDERS BY THE MDL COURT AND

BANKRUPTCY COURTS. ASSUMING THE CONTINGENCIES ARE MET, THE FIRM HAS AGREED TO PAY THE ARIZONA

NOTEHOLDERS THE SUM OF $375 MILLION FOR ALL CLAIMS AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS HELD BY THEM AND HAS AGREED

TO PAY THE UAT THE SUM OF $50 MILLION FOR ALL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL CLAIMS HELD BY IT.

IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS SERVED SUBPOENAS ON JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND

BANK ONE, N.A. (BANK ONE) AND HAS INTERVIEWED CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. ON APRIL 25,

2005, THE STAFF OF THE MIDWEST REGIONAL OFFICE OF THE SEC WROTE TO ADVISE BANK ONE THAT IT IS

CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMISSION BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION AGAINST BANK ONE AND A

FORMER EMPLOYEE ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH BANK ONES ROLE AS

INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR THE NPF XII NOTE PROGRAM. ON JULY 8, 2005, THE STAFF OF THE MIDWEST REGIONAL

OFFICE OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WROTE TO ADVISE THAT IT IS CONSIDERING

RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMISSION BRING A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION AGAINST TWO INDIVIDUALS, ONE

PRESENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE FIRMS AFFILIATES, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN SECURITIES

LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ROLE AS FORMER MEMBERS OF NCFES BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON JULY 13,

2005, THE STAFF FURTHER ADVISED THAT IT IS CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMISSION ALSO BRING

A CIVIL INJUNCTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE FIRM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE TWO

INDIVIDUALS AS ALLEGED AGENTS OF THE FIRM. LASTLY, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ALSO

INVESTIGATING THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE COLLAPSE OF NCFE, AND THE FIRM IS COOPERATING WITH THAT

INVESTIGATION.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS CASES, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS MAY BE BROUGHT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. IN VIEW OF THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE CLAIMANTS

SEEK VERY LARGE OR INDETERMINATE DAMAGES, OR WHERE THE CASES PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES, INVOLVE

A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR ARE IN EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY, THE FIRM CANNOT STATE WITH

CONFIDENCE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE PENDING MATTERS WILL BE, WHAT THE TIMING OF THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE OR WHAT THE EVENTUAL LOSS, FINES OR PENALTIES RELATED

TO EACH PENDING MATTER MAY BE. JPMORGAN CHASE BELIEVES, BASED UPON ITS CURRENT

KNOWLEDGE, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL AND AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS CURRENT LITIGATION

RESERVES, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING

AGAINST IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL, ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

THE FIRM. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ACTIONS AND

INVESTIGATIONS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE RESERVES CURRENTLY ACCRUED BY THE FIRM; AS A RESULT, THE OUTCOME OF A

PARTICULAR MATTER MAY BE MATERIAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD,

DEPENDING UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE SIZE OF THE LOSS OR LIABILITY IMPOSED AND THE LEVEL OF

JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

2005 REPRESENTED THE FIRMS FIRST FULL YEAR AS A MERGED COMPANY; 2004 INCLUDED SIX MONTHS OF

THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. THEREFORE,

COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE TWO YEARS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, OTHER KEY

FACTORS AFFECTING 2005 RESULTS INCLUDED LITIGATION CHARGES TO SETTLE THE ENRON AND WORLDCOM CLASS

ACTIONS, A SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, THE IMPACT OF THE NEW

BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION ON CREDIT CARD CHARGE-OFFS AND THE SALE OF BROWNCO, AS WELL AS THE GLOBAL

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENTS.

IN 2005, THE FIRM SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A NUMBER OF MILESTONES IN THE EXECUTION OF ITS MERGER

INTEGRATION PLAN. KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDED: LAUNCHING A NATIONAL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THAT

INTRODUCED A MODERNIZED CHASE BRAND; THE CONVERSION OF 1,400 BANK ONE BRANCHES, 3,400 ATMS AND

MILLIONS OF BANK ONE CREDIT CARDS TO THE CHASE BRAND; COMPLETING THE OPERATING PLATFORM CONVERSION

IN CARD SERVICES; AND EXECUTING A MAJOR SYSTEMS CONVERSION IN TEXAS THAT UNITED 400 CHASE AND BANK

ONE BRANCHES AND OVER 800 ATMS UNDER COMMON SYSTEMS AND BRANDING. THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS RESULTED IN

CONTINUED EFFICIENCIES FROM THE MERGER, AND THE FIRM MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD REACHING THE

MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS TARGET OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION BY THE END OF 2007. THE FIRM REALIZED

APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION OF MERGER SAVINGS IN 2005, BRINGING

ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE SAVINGS TO $1.9 BILLION, AND THE ANNUALIZED RUN-RATE OF SAVINGS

ENTERING 2006 IS APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE SAVINGS, THE FIRM EXPENSED

MERGER-RELATED COSTS OF $722 MILLION DURING THE YEAR, BRINGING THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE AMOUNT EXPENSED

SINCE THE MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT TO $2.1 BILLION. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO ESTIMATE REMAINING MERGER

COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 BILLION TO $1.4 BILLION, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE EXPENSED OVER THE

NEXT TWO YEARS.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAT JAMES DIMON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF

OPERATING OFFICER, WOULD SUCCEED CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM B. HARRISON, JR. AS

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. MR. HARRISON REMAINS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

THE FIRM REPORTED 2005 NET INCOME OF $8.5 BILLION, OR $2.38 PER SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF

$4.5 BILLION, OR $1.55 PER SHARE, FOR 2004. THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 8% COMPARED WITH 6% IN

2004.

RESULTS INCLUDED $2.0 BILLION IN AFTER-TAX CHARGES, OR $0.57 PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDED NONOPERATING

LITIGATION CHARGES OF $1.6 BILLION AND MERGER COSTS OF $448 MILLION. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGES,

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $10.5 BILLION, OR $2.95 PER SHARE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WAS 10%.

OPERATING EARNINGS REPRESENT BUSINESS RESULTS WITHOUT MERGER-RELATED COSTS, NONOPERATING

LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGES AND RECOVERIES, AND COSTS RELATED TO CONFORMANCE OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

IN 2005, BOTH THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES CONTINUED TO EXPAND. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT INCREASED

BY AN ESTIMATED 3.0% GLOBALLY WITH THE U.S. ECONOMY GROWING AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER PACE. THE U.S.

ECONOMY EXPERIENCED CONTINUED RISING SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ACTIONS DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE INCREASED FROM 2.25% TO

4.25% DURING THE YEAR, AND THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENED AS LONG TERM INTEREST RATES REMAINED BROADLY

STEADY. EQUITY MARKETS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, REFLECTED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE, WITH THE

S&P 500 UP 3% AND INTERNATIONAL INDICES INCREASING OVER 20%. CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY WAS VERY

STRONG DURING 2005, WITH DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING AND MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

SURPASSING 2004 LEVELS. THE U.S. CONSUMER SECTOR SHOWED CONTINUED STRENGTH BUOYED BY OVERALL

ECONOMIC STRENGTH, WHICH BENEFITED FROM GOOD LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND RETAIL SALES THAT INCREASED

VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS STRENGTH CAME DESPITE SLOWING MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND REFINANCE

ACTIVITY AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BANKRUPTCY FILINGS DUE TO THE NEW BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION

WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2005.

THE 2005 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRM AND EACH OF

ITS BUSINESSES. THE OVERALL ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND STRONG LEVEL OF CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY HELPED

TO DRIVE NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND SALES GROWTH WITHIN EACH BUSINESS. THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BOTH WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN SPREADS, THOUGH WHOLESALE LIABILITY SPREADS

WIDENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, BENEFITING TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND COMMERCIAL

BANKING. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO REMAIN STRONG,

REFLECTING THE BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DESPITE THE IMPACTS OF ACCELERATED BANKRUPTCY

FILINGS AND HURRICANE KATRINA.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS, ON AN OPERATING BASIS AND EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE

MERGER, THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF THE FIRMS LINES OF BUSINESS.

INVESTMENT BANK OPERATING EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER REVENUE AND A CONTINUED BENEFIT FROM THE

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY INCREASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. REVENUE GROWTH

WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER, ALTHOUGH VOLATILE, FIXED INCOME TRADING RESULTS, STRONGER EQUITY COMMISSIONS

AND IMPROVED INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, ALL OF WHICH BENEFITED FROM STRENGTH IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS

ACTIVITY. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES HAD PARTICULAR STRENGTH IN ADVISORY, REFLECTING IN PART THE

BENEFIT OF THE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP WITH CAZENOVE, WHICH WAS FORMED IN FEBRUARY OF 2005. AS IN

2004, THE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

25

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2005 WAS A BENEFIT TO EARNINGS, MAINLY DUE TO CONTINUED

IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION DUE TO INCREASED REVENUES.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATING EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE U.S.

ECONOMY, WHICH LED TO INCREASED DEPOSIT, HOME EQUITY AND MORTGAGE BALANCES. IN ADDITION TO THE

BENEFIT FROM HIGHER BALANCES, REVENUES INCREASED DUE TO IMPROVED MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS)

RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS. EXPENSES DECLINED, REFLECTING ONGOING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS ALL

BUSINESSES EVEN AS INVESTMENTS CONTINUED IN RETAIL BANKING DISTRIBUTION AND SALES, WITH THE NET

ADDITION DURING THE YEAR OF 133 BRANCH OFFICES, 662 ATMS AND OVER 1,300 PERSONAL BANKERS. THESE

BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON LOANS DUE TO THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT

AND NET LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LOAN PORTFOLIO SALE ACTIVITY. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

BENEFITED FROM IMPROVED CREDIT TRENDS IN MOST CONSUMER LENDING PORTFOLIOS AND FROM LOAN PORTFOLIO

SALES, BUT WAS AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA.

CARD SERVICES OPERATING EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM LOWER EXPENSES DRIVEN BY MERGER SAVINGS AND GREATER

EFFICIENCIES FROM THE OPERATING PLATFORM CONVERSION, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER PROCESSING AND

COMPENSATION COSTS. REVENUE BENEFITED FROM HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME

RESULTING FROM MARKETING INITIATIVES AND INCREASED CONSUMER SPENDING. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS

GROWTH WERE NARROWER SPREADS ON LOAN BALANCES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS IN THEIR INTRODUCTORY

RATE PERIOD AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE MANAGED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED DUE TO

RECORD LEVELS OF BANKRUPTCY-RELATED CHARGE-OFFS RELATED TO THE NEW BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION THAT

BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2005 AND A SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA. DESPITE

THESE EVENTS, UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY REMAINED STRONG, WITH A MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO OF

5.21%, DOWN FROM 5.27% IN 2004.

COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATING EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM WIDER SPREADS AND HIGHER VOLUMES RELATED TO

LIABILITY BALANCES AND INCREASED LOAN BALANCES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS WERE NARROWER

LOAN SPREADS RELATED TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SOME MARKETS AND LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DUE TO

HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED DUE TO A SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED

TO HURRICANE KATRINA, INCREASED LOAN BALANCES AND REFINEMENTS IN THE DATA USED TO ESTIMATE THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY IN THE PORTFOLIO WAS STRONG

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AS EVIDENCED BY LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS AND NONPERFORMING LOANS COMPARED WITH

2004.

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES OPERATING EARNINGS GREW SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2005. REVENUE GROWTH

RESULTED FROM BUSINESS GROWTH AND WIDENING SPREADS ON, AND GROWTH IN, LIABILITY BALANCES, ALL OF

WHICH BENEFITED FROM GLOBAL ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND CAPITAL MARKET ACTIVITY. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THIS GROWTH WERE LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES. EXPENSES DECREASED DUE TO

LOWER SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM

NEW BUSINESS GROWTH, THE VASTERA ACQUISITION COMPLETED IN APRIL, AND BY CHARGES TAKEN IN THE SECOND

QUARTER TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT.

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT OPERATING EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM NET ASSET INFLOWS AND ASSET

APPRECIATION, BOTH THE RESULT OF FAVORABLE CAPITAL MARKETS AND IMPROVED INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE,

WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASED LEVEL OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. RESULTS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF A MAJORITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2004 AND GROWTH IN DEPOSIT AND LOAN BALANCES. EXPENSES INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE ACQUISITION

OF HIGHBRIDGE AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATED TO INCREASED REVENUE.

CORPORATE SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS WERE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY REPOSITIONING OF THE TREASURY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THIS DECLINE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO OF $1.3 BILLION

(PRE-TAX) AND IMPROVED PRIVATE EQUITY RESULTS.

THE FIRM

HAD, AT YEAR-END, TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF $107 BILLION, AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO

OF 8.5%. THE FIRM PURCHASED $3.4 BILLION, OR 93.5 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE YEAR.

2006 BUSINESS OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES COULD CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN

SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES OUTLOOK FOR 2006 SHOULD BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE INTEGRALLY LINKED. WHILE THE

FIRM CONSIDERS OUTCOMES FOR, AND HAS CONTINGENCY PLANS TO RESPOND TO, STRESS ENVIRONMENTS, THE

BASIC OUTLOOK FOR 2006 IS PREDICATED ON THE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS IMPLIED IN THE FORWARD RATE

CURVE FOR U.S. TREASURIES, THE CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS AND

CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIRMS CAPITAL MARKETS AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY OVERALL

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY FINANCIAL MARKET MOVEMENTS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS. THE INVESTMENT BANK ENTERS 2006 WITH A STRONG

INVESTMENT BANKING FEE PIPELINE AND CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON NEW PRODUCT EXPANSION INITIATIVES, SUCH

AS COMMODITIES AND SECURITIZED PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO BENEFIT GROWTH AND REDUCE VOLATILITY

IN TRADING RESULTS OVER TIME. COMPARED WITH 2005, THE INVESTMENT BANK ANTICIPATES LOWER CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES DUE

TO REDUCED GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS. ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES CONTINUED GROWTH DRIVEN

BY CONTINUED NET INFLOWS TO ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION. TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND COMMERCIAL

BANKING EXPECT GROWTH DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND PRODUCT SALES.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES ANTICIPATES BENEFITING FROM THE EXPANDED BRANCH NETWORK AND SALESFORCE,

AND IMPROVED SALES PRODUCTIVITY AND CROSS-SELLING IN THE BRANCHES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRESSURE ON

LOAN AND DEPOSIT SPREADS DUE TO THE HIGHER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE ACQUISITION OF COLLEGIATE

FUNDING SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE MODESTLY TO EARNINGS IN 2006.

CARD SERVICES ANTICIPATES THAT MANAGED RECEIVABLES WILL GROW IN LINE WITH THE OVERALL CREDIT CARD

INDUSTRY, BENEFITING FROM MARKETING INITIATIVES, NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS

CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS. REVENUES AND EXPENSES ALSO WILL REFLECT THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF THE

PAYMENTECH DECONSOLIDATION AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS.

THE CORPORATE SEGMENT INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY, TREASURY AND OTHER CORPORATE SUPPORT UNITS. THE

REVENUE OUTLOOK FOR THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE EQUITY

MARKETS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS. IF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS

PERSIST, THE FIRM ANTICIPATES CONTINUED REALIZATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN 2006, BUT RESULTS

CAN BE VOLATILE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT TREASURY NET INTEREST

26

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

INCOME WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE AND THAT THE NET LOSS IN OTHER CORPORATE WILL BE REDUCED AS

MERGER SAVINGS AND OTHER EXPENSE REDUCTION INITIATIVES, SUCH AS LESS EXCESS REAL ESTATE, ARE

REALIZED.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2006 IS ANTICIPATED TO BE HIGHER THAN IN 2005, PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY A TREND TOWARD A MORE NORMAL LEVEL OF PROVISIONING FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE WHOLESALE

BUSINESSES. THE CONSUMER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2006 SHOULD REFLECT GENERALLY STABLE

UNDERLYING ASSET QUALITY. HOWEVER, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FIRST HALF OF 2006 WILL EXPERIENCE

LOWER CREDIT CARD NET CHARGE-OFFS, AS THE RECORD LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2005 ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE INCLUDED BANKRUPTCY FILINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE OCCURRED IN

2006. THE SECOND HALF OF 2006 IS EXPECTED

TO INCLUDE INCREASED CREDIT CARD DELINQUENCIES AND NET CHARGE-OFFS AS A RESULT OF

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW FFIEC MINIMUM PAYMENT RULES.

FIRMWIDE EXPENSES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BENEFIT AS THE RUN RATE OF MERGER SAVINGS IS EXPECTED TO REACH

APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION BY THE END OF 2006 DRIVEN BY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE TRI-STATE RETAIL

CONVERSION AND DATA CENTER UPGRADES. OFFSETTING THE MERGER SAVINGS WILL BE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

DISTRIBUTION ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS; EXTENSIVE MERGER INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES AND

UPGRADING OF TECHNOLOGY; AND EXPENSES RELATED TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE SEARS CANADA

CREDIT CARD BUSINESS AND COLLEGIATE FUNDING SERVICES.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR 2005 WAS $54.5 BILLION, UP 27% FROM 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, WHICH

AFFECTED EVERY REVENUE CATEGORY. THE INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ALSO WAS AFFECTED BY A $1.3

BILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO; HIGHER TRADING REVENUE; AND HIGHER ASSET MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS, WHICH BENEFITED FROM SEVERAL NEW INVESTMENTS AND GROWTH IN

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES LOSSES AS A RESULT OF REPOSITIONING OF THE FIRMS TREASURY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW HIGHLIGHT FACTORS OTHER THAN THE MERGER THAT

AFFECTED THE 2005 VERSUS 2004 COMPARISON.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES REFLECTED CONTINUED STRENGTH IN ADVISORY, EQUITY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING, WITH PARTICULAR GROWTH IN EUROPE, WHICH BENEFITED FROM THE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP WITH

CAZENOVE. TRADING REVENUE INCREASED FROM 2004, REFLECTING STRENGTH IN FIXED INCOME, EQUITIES AND

COMMODITIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND TRADING REVENUE, WHICH ARE

PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE IB, SEE THE IB SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 3638 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE HIGHER LENDING & DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES WERE DRIVEN BY THE MERGER; ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE

MERGER, THE DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES WOULD HAVE BEEN LOWER DUE TO RISING INTEREST RATES. IN A HIGHER

INTEREST-RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE VALUE OF DEPOSIT BALANCES TO A CUSTOMER IS GREATER, RESULTING IN A

REDUCTION OF DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LIABILITY BALANCES (INCLUDING

DEPOSITS) SEE THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 4748 AND 4950, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL

FEES FROM SEVERAL NEW INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A MAJORITY INTEREST IN HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,

LLC, THE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP WITH CAZENOVE AND THE ACQUISITION OF VASTERA. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO

THE HIGHER LEVEL OF REVENUE WAS AN INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING NET ASSET

INFLOWS, MAINLY IN EQUITY-RELATED PRODUCTS, AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION. IN ADDITION,

ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY WERE UP DUE TO MARKET VALUE APPRECIATION AND NEW BUSINESS. COMMISSIONS ROSE AS

A RESULT OF A HIGHER VOLUME OF BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE FEES AND

COMMISSIONS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS FOR IB ON PAGES 3638, AWM ON PAGES 5152 AND TSS ON

PAGES 4950 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE DECLINE IN SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS REFLECTED $1.3 BILLION OF SECURITIES LOSSES, AS

COMPARED WITH $338 MILLION OF GAINS IN 2004. THE LOSSES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM REPOSITIONING THE

FIRMS TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO RISING INTEREST RATES. THE SECURITIES LOSSES

WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY HIGHER PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS DUE TO A CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE CAPITAL

MARKETS CONDITIONS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, WHICH ARE RECORDED

PRIMARILY IN THE FIRMS TREASURY AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES, SEE THE CORPORATE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 5354 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME INCREASED DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS RELATED

TO MSR ASSETS. MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NII AND AFS SECURITIES GAINS

RELATED TO HOME MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, WHICH IS

RECORDED PRIMARILY IN RFSS HOME FINANCE BUSINESS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSION FOR RFS ON PAGES

3944 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CREDIT CARD INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTERCHANGE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN

CHARGE VOLUME. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS;

REWARDS EXPENSE; AND THE IMPACT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH, WHICH WAS DECONSOLIDATED UPON

COMPLETION OF THE INTEGRATION OF CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES AND THE PAYMENTECH MERCHANT PROCESSING

BUSINESSES IN 2005. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CREDIT CARD INCOME, SEE CS SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES

4546 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED A $1.3 BILLION PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO

TO E*TRADE FINANCIAL; HIGHER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS AND LOAN SALES; AND HIGHER REVENUES

AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT FROM FINANCING LEASES TO OPERATING LEASES IN THE AUTO BUSINESS. THESE GAINS

WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY WRITE-DOWNS ON AUTO LOANS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO HELD-FOR-SALE AND A

ONE-TIME GAIN IN 2004 ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTMENT.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER AVERAGE VOLUME OF, AND WIDER SPREADS ON, LIABILITY

BALANCES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS HIGHER AVERAGE VOLUME OF WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER

LOANS, IN PARTICULAR, HOME EQUITY AND CREDIT CARD LOANS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

NARROWER SPREADS ON CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE LOANS AND ON TRADING ASSETS, AS WELL AS REDUCED TREASURY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE FIRMS TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS IN 2005 WERE $916

BILLION, UP 23% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE NET INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.19%, A DECREASE OF SIX BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

TOTAL NET REVENUES, AT $43.1 BILLION, ROSE BY $9.7 BILLION, OR 29%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER,

WHICH AFFECTED EVERY CATEGORY OF TOTAL NET REVENUE. THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS FACTORS

OTHER THAN THE MERGER THAT AFFECTED THE 2004 VERSUS 2003 COMPARISON.

THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT BANKING FEES WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN UNDERWRITING AND

ADVISORY ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES AND MARKET SHARE GAINS. TRADING

REVENUE DECLINED BY 18%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN FIXED INCOME AND

EQUITIES.

LENDING

& DEPOSIT RELATED FEES WERE UP FROM 2003 DUE TO THE MERGER. THE RISE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, AS CLIENTS PAID FOR SERVICES WITH DEPOSITS

VERSUS FEES DUE TO RISING INTEREST RATES. THROUGHOUT 2004, DEPOSIT BALANCES GREW IN RESPONSE TO

RISING INTEREST RATES.

THE INCREASE IN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND COMMISSIONS WAS DRIVEN ALSO BY THE FULL-YEAR

IMPACT OF OTHER ACQUISITIONS  SUCH AS EFS IN JANUARY 2004, BANK ONES CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS IN

NOVEMBER 2003 AND JPMORGAN RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES IN

JUNE 2003  AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL

EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION, NET ASSET INFLOWS AND A BETTER PRODUCT MIX. IN ADDITION, A MORE ACTIVE

MARKET FOR TRADING ACTIVITIES IN 2004 RESULTED IN HIGHER BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS.

SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS FOR 2004 ROSE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY FUELED BY THE

IMPROVEMENT IN THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT RESULTS. THIS CHANGE WAS OFFSET BY LOWER

SECURITIES GAINS ON THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUMES OF SECURITIES

SOLD, AND LOWER GAINS REALIZED ON SALES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES. ADDITIONALLY, RFSS HOME

FINANCE BUSINESS REPORTED LOSSES IN 2004 ON AFS SECURITIES, AS COMPARED WITH GAINS IN 2003. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SECURITIES GAINS, SEE THE RFS AND CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES

3944 AND 5354, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SERVICING REVENUE; THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS AND PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE, AND BY

LOWER GAINS FROM SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS OF SUBPRIME LOANS AS A RESULT OF MANAGEMENTS DECISION

IN 2004 TO RETAIN THESE LOANS. MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NII AND

SECURITIES GAINS RELATED TO HOME MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES.

CREDIT CARD INCOME INCREASED FROM 2003 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CUSTOMER CHARGE VOLUME, WHICH RESULTED

IN INCREASED INTERCHANGE INCOME, AND HIGHER CREDIT CARD SERVICING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE

OF $19.4 BILLION IN AVERAGE SECURITIZED LOANS. THE INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY HIGHER

VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS AND REWARDS EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME FROM 2003 REFLECTED GAINS ON LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS, THE SALE OF

AN INVESTMENT IN 2004 AND HIGHER NET RESULTS FROM CORPORATE- AND BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

POLICIES. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS IN 2004 WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY GAINS ON SALES OF SEVERAL

NONSTRATEGIC BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES IN 2003.

NET INTEREST INCOME ROSE FROM 2003 AS GROWTH IN VOLUMES OF CONSUMER LOANS AND DEPOSITS, AS WELL AS

WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSITS, CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER NET INTEREST INCOME. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER WHOLESALE LOAN BALANCES IN THE IB AND TIGHTER SPREADS ON LOANS,

INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND TRADING ASSETS STEMMING FROM THE RISE IN INTEREST RATES. THE FIRMS TOTAL

AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS FOR 2004 WERE $744 BILLION, UP $154 BILLION FROM 2003. THE NET

INTEREST YIELD ON THESE ASSETS, ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WAS 2.25% IN 2004, AN INCREASE

OF FOUR BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $3.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $939 MILLION, OR 37%, FROM 2004,

REFLECTING THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE WHOLESALE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A

BENEFIT OF $811 MILLION FOR THE YEAR COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $716 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

REFLECTING CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CREDIT QUALITY. THE WHOLESALE LOAN NET RECOVERY RATE WAS 0.06% IN

2005, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM A NET CHARGE-OFF RATE OF 0.18% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE TOTAL CONSUMER

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $4.3 BILLION,

$1.9 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, HIGHER BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET

CHARGE-OFFS IN CARD SERVICES AND A $350 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION FOR HURRICANE KATRINA. 2004

INCLUDED ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS,

THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO SHOW STRENGTH IN CREDIT QUALITY.

THE FIRM HAD TOTAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS OF $2.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, A DECLINE OF $641

MILLION, OR 20%, FROM THE 2004 LEVEL OF $3.2 BILLION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROVISION

FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK, SEE THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGES 6374 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $2.5 BILLION WAS UP $1.0 BILLION, OR 65%, COMPARED WITH 2003.

THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER AND ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY CHARGES OF $858 MILLION WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY RELEASES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO,

PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY IN THE IB, AND THE SALE OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN

PORTFOLIO IN RFS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $38.8 BILLION, UP 13% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FULL-YEAR

IMPACT OF THE MERGER. EXCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES AND MERGER COSTS, NONINTEREST EXPENSE

WOULD HAVE BEEN $35.5 BILLION, UP 21%. IN ADDITION TO THE MERGER, EXPENSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF

HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES, CONTINUED INVESTMENT SPENDING IN THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND

INCREMENTAL MARKETING EXPENSES RELATED TO LAUNCHING THE NEW CHASE BRAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE FIRM. EACH CATEGORY OF NONINTEREST

EXPENSE WAS AFFECTED BY THE MERGER. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW HIGHLIGHT FACTORS OTHER THAN THE

MERGER THAT AFFECTED THE 2005 VERSUS 2004 COMPARISON.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE ROSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES; ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT

DUE TO THE INSOURCING OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE (EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004,

WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE TERMINATED THE FIRMS OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH IBM); THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING CAZENOVE, HIGHBRIDGE AND VASTERA; THE ACCELERATED VESTING OF CERTAIN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS; AND BUSINESS GROWTH. THE EFFECT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE IBM OUTSOURCING

AGREEMENT WAS TO SHIFT EXPENSES FROM TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE

FIRM. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES,

SEE NOTE 7 ON PAGES 100102 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

CHARGES FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE AND A NET RELEASE OF EXCESS PROPERTY TAX ACCRUALS, COMPARED WITH

$103 MILLION OF CHARGES FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE IN 2004.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE WAS DOWN ONLY SLIGHTLY. THIS REDUCTION REFLECTS THE OFFSET OF

SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS FOR 2004 AGAINST THE FULL-YEAR 2005 IMPACT FROM

TERMINATION OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH IBM. THE REDUCTION IN TECHNOLOGY AND

COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE DUE TO THE OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT TERMINATION IS MOSTLY OFFSET BY INCREASES

IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT AND INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRMS HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE INFRASTRUCTURE.

PROFESSIONAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICES WERE HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE

INSOURCING OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, UPGRADES TO THE FIRMS SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY, AND BUSINESS GROWTH.

THESE EXPENSES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

MARKETING EXPENSE WAS HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AND

THE COST OF ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE NEW CHASE BRAND.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE REFLECTED INCREMENTAL EXPENSES RELATED TO INVESTMENTS MADE IN 2005,

AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN OPERATING CHARGES FOR LEGAL MATTERS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE

WAS A $93 MILLION CHARGE TAKEN BY TSS TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT AND A $40 MILLION CHARGE TAKEN

BY RFS RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A STUDENT LOAN JOINT VENTURE. THESE ITEMS WERE OFFSET

PARTIALLY BY LOWER SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT WRITE-OFFS, MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER EFFICIENCIES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 15 AND NOTE 8 ON

PAGES 114116 AND 103, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE 2005 NONOPERATING LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES THAT WERE RECORDED BY THE FIRM WERE AS FOLLOWS: A

$1.9 BILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ENRON CLASS ACTION LITIGATION AND FOR CERTAIN

OTHER MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND A $900 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE SETTLEMENT COSTS OF THE WORLDCOM

CLASS ACTION LITIGATION; THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $208 MILLION INSURANCE RECOVERY RELATED TO CERTAIN

MATERIAL LITIGATION. IN COMPARISON, 2004 INCLUDED A $3.7 BILLION NONOPERATING CHARGE TO INCREASE

LITIGATION RESERVES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LITIGATION, REFER TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE 123 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $34.4 BILLION IN 2004, UP $12.5 BILLION, OR 57%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER. EXCLUDING $1.4 BILLION OF MERGER COSTS, AND LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES, NONINTEREST EXPENSE

WOULD HAVE BEEN $29.3 BILLION, UP 35%. THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS HIGHLIGHTS OTHER FACTORS

AFFECTING THE 2004 VERSUS 2003 COMPARISON.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS UP FROM 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE IB AND

CONTINUING EXPANSION IN RFS. THESE FACTORS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY ONGOING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

AND MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE FIRM, AND BY A REDUCTION IN PENSION COSTS. THE DECLINE IN

PENSION COSTS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE MAINLY TO THE INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

RESULTING FROM A DISCRETIONARY $1.1 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIRMS PENSION PLAN IN APRIL 2004,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003.

THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY EXPENSE WAS OFFSET PARTLY BY LOWER CHARGES FOR EXCESS REAL ESTATE, WHICH

WERE $103 MILLION IN 2004 COMPARED WITH $270 MILLION IN 2003.

TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS EXPENSE WAS HIGHER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER USE OF OUTSIDE VENDORS, PRIMARILY IBM, TO SUPPORT THE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRM. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE IBM OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT, SEE THE

CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 53 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

PROFESSIONAL & OUTSIDE SERVICES ROSE DUE TO HIGHER LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION MATTERS,

AS WELL AS OUTSIDE SERVICES STEMMING FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS  PRIMARILY ELECTRONIC FINANCIAL

SERVICES (EFS), AND GROWTH IN BUSINESS AT TSS AND CS.

MARKETING EXPENSE ROSE AS CS INITIATED A MORE ROBUST MARKETING CAMPAIGN DURING 2004.

OTHER EXPENSE WAS UP DUE TO SOFTWARE IMPAIRMENT WRITE-OFFS OF $224 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN TSS AND

CORPORATE, COMPARED WITH $60 MILLION IN 2003; HIGHER OPERATING CHARGES FOR LEGAL MATTERS; AND

GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME. THESE EXPENSES WERE OFFSET PARTLY BY A $57 MILLION SETTLEMENT RELATED TO

THE ENRON SURETY BOND LITIGATION.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND MERGER COSTS, REFER TO NOTE 15 AND NOTE 8 ON

PAGES 114116 AND 103, RESPECTIVELY.

IN JUNE OF 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDED A $3.7 BILLION ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION RESERVE. BY

COMPARISON, 2003 INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $100 MILLION FOR ENRON-RELATED LITIGATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. 2003 REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME

COMBINED WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WERE LOWER 2005 NONOPERATING CHARGES AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF

BROWNCO, WHICH WERE TAXED AT MARGINAL TAX RATES OF 38% AND 40%, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INCREASES WERE

OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A TAX BENEFIT OF $55 MILLION RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPATRIATION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2004, AS COMPARED WITH 2003, WAS THE RESULT OF VARIOUS

FACTORS, INCLUDING LOWER REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME, A HIGHER LEVEL OF BUSINESS TAX CREDITS, AND

CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. THE MERGER COSTS AND

ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN 2004, AND THE LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGE

RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, REFLECTED A TAX BENEFIT AT A 38% MARGINAL TAX RATE,

CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED WITH 2003.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

THE FIRM PREPARES ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP); THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEAR ON PAGES

8790 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THAT PRESENTATION, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS REPORTED BASIS, PROVIDES

THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS RESULTS THAT CAN BE TRACKED CONSISTENTLY FROM YEAR

TO YEAR AND ENABLES A COMPARISON OF THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES U.S. GAAP

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE FIRMS AND

THE LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE

FIRMS DEFINITION OF OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. OPERATING BASIS

EXCLUDES: (I) MERGER COSTS, (II) THE NONOPERATING LITIGATION CHARGES TAKEN AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES

RECEIVED WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS MATERIAL LITIGATION; AND (III) COSTS RELATED TO THE

CONFORMANCE OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE

ITEMS ARE NOT PART OF THE FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND, THEREFORE, NOT INDICATIVE OF

TRENDS, AS THEY DO NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PERIODS. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON

NONOPERATING LITIGATION CHARGES, SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS ON PAGE 134 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MANAGES ITS LINES OF BUSINESS ON AN OPERATING BASIS. IN THE CASE OF THE

INVESTMENT BANK, NONINTEREST REVENUE ON AN OPERATING BASIS INCLUDES, IN TRADING-RELATED REVENUE,

NET INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO TRADING ACTIVITIES. TRADING ACTIVITIES GENERATE REVENUES, WHICH ARE

RECORDED FOR U.S. GAAP PURPOSES IN TWO LINE ITEMS ON THE INCOME STATEMENT: TRADING REVENUE, WHICH

INCLUDES THE MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES ON TRADING POSITIONS; AND NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH

INCLUDES THE INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE RELATED TO THOSE POSITIONS. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MARKET

INTEREST RATES WILL EITHER BE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE OR NET INTEREST INCOME DEPENDING ON

WHETHER THE TRADING POSITION IS A CASH SECURITY OR A DERIVATIVE. COMBINING BOTH THE TRADING REVENUE

AND RELATED NET INTEREST INCOME ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF THE

INVESTMENT BANKS TRADING ACTIVITIES, WHICH FOR GAAP PURPOSES ARE REPORTED IN BOTH TRADING REVENUE

AND NET INTEREST INCOME. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THIS PRESENTATION ALSO FACILITATES OPERATING

COMPARISONS TO COMPETITORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF TRADING-RELATED

REVENUE, SEE THE IB ON PAGES 3638

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE CASE OF CARD SERVICES, OPERATING BASIS IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS MANAGED BASIS, AND EXCLUDES

THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON TOTAL NET REVENUE, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES,

NET CHARGE-OFFS AND LOAN RECEIVABLES. THIS PRESENTATION IS PROVIDED

TO FACILITATE OPERATING COMPARISONS TO COMPETITORS. THROUGH SECURITIZATION, THE FIRM TRANSFORMS A

PORTION OF ITS CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INTO SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SOLD TO INVESTORS. THE CREDIT

CARD RECEIVABLES ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THROUGH THE TRANSFER OF THE

RECEIVABLES TO A TRUST, AND THE SALE OF UNDIVIDED INTERESTS TO INVESTORS THAT ENTITLE THE INVESTORS

TO SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM THE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. THE FIRM RETAINS THE REMAINING

UNDIVIDED INTERESTS AS SELLERS INTERESTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN LOANS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE SALE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES TO INVESTORS IS RECORDED IN

OTHER

INCOME. SECURITIZATION ALSO AFFECTS THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS INTEREST INCOME, CERTAIN FEE REVENUE, RECOVERIES IN EXCESS

OF INTEREST PAID TO THE INVESTORS, GROSS CREDIT LOSSES AND OTHER TRUST EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES ARE ALL RECLASSIFIED INTO CREDIT CARD INCOME. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS OF CARD SERVICES

RESULTS, SEE PAGE 46 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING LOANS AND RESIDUAL INTERESTS

SOLD AND SECURITIZED, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE

CONCEPT OF MANAGED RECEIVABLES TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD LOANS, BOTH SOLD AND NOT SOLD: AS THE SAME BORROWER IS

CONTINUING TO USE THE CREDIT CARD FOR ONGOING CHARGES, A BORROWERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT

BOTH THE LOAN RECEIVABLES SOLD UNDER SFAS 140 AND THOSE NOT SOLD. THUS, IN ITS DISCLOSURES

REGARDING MANAGED LOAN RECEIVABLES, JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE

STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN ORDER TO DISCLOSE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE (SUCH AS NET CHARGE-OFF

RATES) OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, CARD SERVICES OPERATIONS ARE

FUNDED, OPERATING RESULTS ARE EVALUATED, AND DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ALLOCATING RESOURCES SUCH AS

EMPLOYEES AND CAPITAL BASED UPON MANAGED FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

FINALLY, COMMENCING WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, OPERATING REVENUE (NONINTEREST REVENUE AND NET

INTEREST INCOME) FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS.

ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM TAX EXEMPT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS ARE

PRESENTED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS.

THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUES ARISING

FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE

ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE CORPORATE SECTORS AND THE FIRMS OPERATING

REVENUE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 HAVE BEEN

RESTATED TO BE SIMILARLY PRESENTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. THIS RESTATEMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON THE

CORPORATE SECTORS OR THE FIRMS OPERATING EARNINGS.

MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THESE

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS SEGMENT AND FACILITATE A COMPARISON

OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPETITORS.

NONOPERATING ITEMS

THE RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING RESULTS IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE

SETS FORTH THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL NONOPERATING ITEMS INCURRED BY THE FIRM IN 2005 AND 2004. THESE

NONOPERATING ITEMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM OPERATING EARNINGS, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE ITEMS ARE NOT

PART OF THE FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND, THEREFORE, NOT INDICATIVE OF TRENDS AS

THEY DO NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PERIODS. THESE ITEMS INCLUDE MERGER COSTS,

NONOPERATING LITIGATION CHARGES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES, AND CHARGES TO CONFORM ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, EACH OF WHICH IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

(1)

MERGER COSTS OF $722 MILLION IN 2005 AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2004 REFLECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MERGER.

(2)

NET NONOPERATING LITIGATION CHARGES OF $2.6 BILLION AND $3.7 BILLION WERE TAKEN IN 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY.

(3)

OTHER INCOME IN 2004 REFLECTS $118 MILLION OF OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS.

(4)

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2004 REFLECTS $858 MILLION OF ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY

ADJUSTMENTS, CONSISTING OF A $1.4 BILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE DECERTIFICATION OF THE SELLERS

INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF $584 MILLION RELATED TO

CONFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER CREDIT PROVISION METHODOLOGIES FOR THE COMBINED FIRM.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

THE FIRM IS MANAGED ON A LINE-OF-BUSINESS BASIS. THE BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

PRESENTED REFLECT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE. THERE ARE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS: THE INVESTMENT BANK, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING,

TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE

SEGMENTS ARE

BASED UPON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND REFLECT THE

MANNER IN WHICH FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES

OF BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED ON AN OPERATING BASIS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING WAS REALIGNED TO REFLECT THE NEW

BUSINESS STRUCTURE OF THE COMBINED FIRM. TREASURY WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE IB INTO CORPORATE. THE

SEGMENT FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN COMPRISED OF CHASE HOME FINANCE, CHASE

CARDMEMBER SERVICES, CHASE AUTO FINANCE, CHASE REGIONAL BANKING AND CHASE MIDDLE MARKET; AS A

RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS SEGMENT IS NOW CALLED RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND IS COMPRISED OF HOME

FINANCE, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE, CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING AND INSURANCE. CHASE

CARDMEMBER SERVICES IS NOW ITS OWN SEGMENT CALLED CARD SERVICES, AND CHASE MIDDLE MARKET MOVED INTO

COMMERCIAL BANKING. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING WAS RENAMED ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN PARTNERS, WHICH FORMERLY WAS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, WAS MOVED INTO

CORPORATE. CORPORATE CURRENTLY COMPRISES PRIVATE EQUITY (JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND ONE EQUITY

PARTNERS) AND TREASURY, AND THE CORPORATE SUPPORT AREAS, WHICH INCLUDE CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY AND

OPERATIONS, AUDIT, EXECUTIVE OFFICE, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE

OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL, CORPORATE REAL ESTATE AND GENERAL SERVICES, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND STRATEGY

AND DEVELOPMENT. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2006, TSS WILL REPORT RESULTS FOR TWO DIVISIONS: TS AND WSS.

WSS WAS FORMED BY CONSOLIDATING IS AND ITS.

SEGMENT RESULTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO JULY 1, 2004, REFLECT HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE-ONLY RESULTS AND

HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT BUSINESS SEGMENT ORGANIZATION AND REPORTING

CLASSIFICATIONS.

(C)

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES WERE IMPLEMENTED DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. THE CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO EACH LINE OF BUSINESS CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS.

STAND-ALONE PEER COMPARABLES, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN

ADDITION, EFFECTIVE WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, GOODWILL, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATED CAPITAL, IS

ONLY ALLOCATED TO THE CORPORATE LINE OF BUSINESS. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT

THESE NEW METHODOLOGIES AND ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PRESENTATION BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2004.

34

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING METHODOLOGY

RESULTS OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT EACH SEGMENT AS IF IT WERE ESSENTIALLY A

STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING PROCESS THAT DERIVES THESE RESULTS ALLOCATES INCOME

AND EXPENSE USING MARKET-BASED METHODOLOGIES. EFFECTIVE WITH THE MERGER ON JULY 1, 2004, SEVERAL OF

THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES WERE REVISED, AS NOTED BELOW. AS PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED

TO REFLECT THESE NEW METHODOLOGIES, THEY ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PRESENTATION OF PERIODS

BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. FURTHER, THE FIRM CONTINUES TO ASSESS THE ASSUMPTIONS,

METHODOLOGIES AND REPORTING RECLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR SEGMENT REPORTING, AND FURTHER REFINEMENTS

MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REVENUE SHARING

WHEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS JOIN EFFORTS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE FIRMS CLIENTS, THE

PARTICIPATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUES FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS. THESE

REVENUE-SHARING AGREEMENTS WERE REVISED ON THE MERGER DATE TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE LINES

OF BUSINESS.

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING

FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING (FTP) IS USED TO ALLOCATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE TO EACH BUSINESS AND

TRANSFER THE PRIMARY INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURES TO CORPORATE. THE ALLOCATION PROCESS IS UNIQUE TO

EACH BUSINESS AND CONSIDERS THE INTEREST RATE RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF

ITS STAND-ALONE PEERS. BUSINESS SEGMENTS MAY RETAIN CERTAIN INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES, SUBJECT TO

MANAGEMENT APPROVAL, THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF A SIMILAR PEER BUSINESS. IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, FTP WAS REVISED TO CONFORM THE POLICIES OF THE COMBINED FIRMS.

EXPENSE ALLOCATION

WHERE BUSINESS SEGMENTS USE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SUPPORT UNITS WITHIN THE FIRM, THE COSTS OF THOSE

SUPPORT UNITS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THOSE EXPENSES ARE ALLOCATED BASED UPON THEIR

ACTUAL COST, OR THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST OR MARKET COST, AS WELL AS UPON USAGE OF THE SERVICES

PROVIDED. EFFECTIVE WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES OF THE

HERITAGE FIRMS WERE ALIGNED TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION,

EXPENSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS CEASED TO BE ALLOCATED

TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

AND ARE RETAINED IN CORPORATE. THESE RETAINED EXPENSES INCLUDE PARENT COMPANY COSTS THAT WOULD NOT

BE INCURRED IF THE SEGMENTS WERE STAND-ALONE BUSINESSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO ALIGN CERTAIN CORPORATE

STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS ALLOCATIONS WITH MARKET PRICES; AND OTHER ONE-TIME ITEMS NOT

ALIGNED WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DURING 2005, THE FIRM REFINED COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES

RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS EXPENSES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE

TRANSPARENCY, CONSISTENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO COSTS ALLOCATED ACROSS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THESE NEW COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION

EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS ALLOCATED CAPITAL BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION STAND-ALONE PEER

COMPARISONS, ECONOMIC RISK MEASURES AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL

ASSIGNED TO EACH BUSINESS IS REFERRED TO AS EQUITY. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, GOODWILL, AS WELL AS

THE ASSOCIATED CAPITAL, WAS ALLOCATED SOLELY TO CORPORATE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2006, THE FIRM EXPECTS

TO REFINE ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO INCLUDE ANY GOODWILL

ASSOCIATED WITH LINE OF BUSINESS-DIRECTED ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE MERGER. U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THE

ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 8183 AND 114116, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT). SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SECTION ON PAGE 56 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE EQUITY FRAMEWORK.

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES THE IB MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS THE

SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS REVISED TO BE BASED

UPON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE EXPOSURES. PRIOR TO THE MERGER,

THE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED UPON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, PLUS THE ALLOCATED CAPITAL ASSOCIATED

WITH THE SHARED CLIENTS.

TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS

SEGMENT AND FIRM RESULTS REFLECT REVENUES ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

TRADING

REVENUE, ON A REPORTED BASIS, EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NET INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO IBS TRADING

ACTIVITIES; THIS INCOME IS RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME. HOWEVER, IN THIS PRESENTATION, TO

ASSESS THE PROFITABILITY OF IBS TRADING BUSINESS, THE FIRM COMBINES THESE REVENUES FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES. THE AMOUNT RECLASSIFIED FROM NET INTEREST INCOME TO TRADING REVENUE WAS $0.2

BILLION, $1.9 BILLION AND $2.1 BILLION FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE FROM

PRIOR YEARS IS DUE TO TIGHTENING SPREADS AS SHORT-TERM FUNDING RATES HAVE RISEN SHARPLY AND ALSO,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, INCREASED FUNDING COSTS FROM GROWTH IN NONINTEREST-BEARING TRADING ASSETS.

(C)

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCLUDES TAX-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX-EXEMPT INCOME FROM

MUNICIPAL BOND INVESTMENTS AND INCOME TAX CREDITS RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS, OF

$752 MILLION, $274 MILLION AND $117 MILLION FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

(D)

TSS IS

CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES MANAGED WITHIN THE IB CREDIT PORTFOLIO

ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT ON PAGE 35

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. 2003 REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $3.7 BILLION WERE UP 24%, OR $710 MILLION, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE

WAS DRIVEN BY THE MERGER, HIGHER REVENUES AND AN INCREASED BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT

LOSSES. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE. RETURN ON EQUITY WAS

18%.

NET REVENUE OF $14.6 BILLION WAS UP $2.0 BILLION, OR 16%, OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING THE

IBS HIGHEST ANNUAL REVENUE SINCE 2000, DRIVEN BY STRONG FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY MARKETS AND

INVESTMENT BANKING FEES. INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OF $4.1 BILLION INCREASED 15% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN ADVISORY FEES RESULTING IN PART FROM THE CAZENOVE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.

ADVISORY REVENUES OF $1.3 BILLION WERE UP 35% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING HIGHER MARKET

VOLUMES. DEBT UNDERWRITING REVENUES OF $2.0 BILLION INCREASED BY 6% DRIVEN BY STRONG LOAN

SYNDICATION FEES. EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES OF $864 MILLION WERE UP 11% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN

BY IMPROVED MARKET SHARE. FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUE OF $7.2 BILLION INCREASED 15%, OR $928

MILLION, DRIVEN BY STRONGER, ALTHOUGH VOLATILE, TRADING RESULTS ACROSS COMMODITIES, EMERGING

MARKETS, RATE MARKETS AND CURRENCIES. EQUITIES MARKETS REVENUES INCREASED 21% TO $1.8 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMMISSIONS, WHICH WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY LOWER TRADING RESULTS, WHICH

ALSO EXPERIENCED A HIGH LEVEL OF VOLATILITY. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES WERE $1.4 BILLION, UP $213

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER GAINS FROM LOAN WORKOUTS AND SALES AS WELL AS HIGHER

TRADING REVENUE FROM CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $838 MILLION COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $640

MILLION IN 2004. THE INCREASED BENEFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND REFLECTED NET RECOVERIES. NONPERFORMING ASSETS OF $645 MILLION DECREASED

BY 46% SINCE THE END OF 2004.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 12% TO $9.7 BILLION, LARGELY REFLECTING HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATED TO GROWTH IN REVENUE. NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS UP 4% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CAZENOVE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP, WHILE THE OVERHEAD

RATIO DECLINED TO 67% FOR 2005, FROM 69% IN 2004.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

IN 2004, OPERATING EARNINGS OF $2.9 BILLION WERE UP 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INCREASES IN INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES, THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN TRADING REVENUES AND NET INTEREST INCOME. RETURN ON EQUITY WAS 17%

FOR 2004.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $12.6 BILLION WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

FIXED INCOME MARKETS REVENUES AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES, OFFSET BY INCREASES IN INVESTMENT

BANKING FEES AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM FIXED INCOME MARKETS WAS

DRIVEN BY WEAKER PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TRADING RESULTS, MAINLY IN THE INTEREST RATE MARKETS

BUSINESS. CREDIT PORTFOLIO REVENUES WERE DOWN DUE TO LOWER NET INTEREST INCOME,

36

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER LOAN BALANCES; THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRADING

REVENUE DUE TO MORE SEVERE CREDIT SPREAD TIGHTENING IN 2003 RELATIVE TO 2004. INVESTMENT BANKING

FEES INCREASED BY 24% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ADVISORY AND DEBT

UNDERWRITING. THE ADVISORY GAINS WERE A RESULT OF INCREASED GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES AND MARKET SHARE,

WHILE THE HIGHER UNDERWRITING FEES WERE DUE TO STRONGER CLIENT ACTIVITY.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $640 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A BENEFIT OF $181

MILLION IN 2003. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROVISION WAS THE RESULT OF A $633 MILLION DECLINE IN NET

CHARGE-OFFS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2004

RELATIVE TO 2003.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS UP 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE FROM 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RESULTING FROM STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER.

AMOUNT OF ADJUSTED ASSETS IS PRESENTED TO ASSIST THE READER IN COMPARING THE IBS ASSET AND CAPITAL

LEVELS TO OTHER INVESTMENT BANKS IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY. ASSET-TO-EQUITY LEVERAGE RATIOS ARE

COMMONLY USED AS ONE MEASURE TO ASSESS A COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE IB BELIEVES AN ADJUSTED

THIS VAR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ACCRUAL LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS NOT MARKED TO MARKET.

(I)

AVERAGE

VARS ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF ITS MARKET RISK COMPONENTS, DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING

FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE RISKS ARE NOT

PERFECTLY CORRELATED. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM

OF THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES.

ACCORDING TO THOMSON FINANCIAL, IN 2005, THE FIRM IMPROVED ITS RANKING IN U.S. DEBT, EQUITY AND

EQUITY-RELATED FROM #5 IN 2004 TO #4 AND IN U.S. EQUITY AND EQUITY-RELATED FROM #6 IN 2004 TO #5.

THE FIRM MAINTAINED ITS #3 POSITION IN GLOBAL ANNOUNCED M&A WITH 24% MARKET SHARE AND ITS #1

POSITION IN GLOBAL SYNDICATED LOANS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED ITS #2 RANKING IN U.S. LONG-TERM DEBT, BUT

DROPPED FROM #2 TO #4 IN GLOBAL LONG-TERM DEBT.

2005

INCLUDES A $250 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: $140

MILLION IN CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING, $90 MILLION IN CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS BANKING AND $20

MILLION IN AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $3.4 BILLION, UP $1.2 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE

LARGELY TO THE MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED DEPOSIT BALANCES AND WIDER SPREADS, HIGHER HOME

EQUITY AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE BALANCES, AND EXPENSE SAVINGS IN ALL BUSINESSES. THESE BENEFITS WERE

PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY NARROWER SPREADS ON RETAINED LOAN PORTFOLIOS, THE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR HURRICANE KATRINA

AND NET LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH PORTFOLIO LOAN SALES IN THE HOME FINANCE AND AUTO BUSINESSES.

NET REVENUE INCREASED TO $14.8 BILLION, UP $4.0 BILLION, OR 37%, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MERGER. NET

INTEREST INCOME OF $10.2 BILLION INCREASED BY $2.5 BILLION AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, INCREASED

DEPOSIT BALANCES AND WIDER SPREADS, AND GROWTH IN RETAINED CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LOANS. THESE

BENEFITS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY NARROWER SPREADS ON LOAN BALANCES AND THE ABSENCE OF LOAN

PORTFOLIOS SOLD IN LATE 2004 AND EARLY 2005. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $4.6 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.5

BILLION DUE TO THE MERGER, IMPROVED MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS, HIGHER AUTOMOBILE OPERATING LEASE

INCOME AND INCREASED BANKING FEES. THESE BENEFITS WERE OFFSET IN PART BY LOSSES ON PORTFOLIO LOAN

SALES IN THE HOME FINANCE AND AUTO BUSINESSES.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED $724 MILLION, UP $275 MILLION, OR 61%, FROM 2004. RESULTS

INCLUDED A SPECIAL PROVISION IN 2005 FOR HURRICANE KATRINA OF $250 MILLION AND A RELEASE IN 2004 OF

$87 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN

PORTFOLIO. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN $62 MILLION,

OR 12%. THE DECLINE REFLECTED REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT TRENDS IN

MOST CONSUMER LENDING PORTFOLIOS AND THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS IN RUN-OFF. THESE REDUCTIONS

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE MERGER AND HIGHER PROVISION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DECISION TO RETAIN

SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE ROSE TO $8.6 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE

PRIMARILY TO THE MERGER. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RETAIL BANKING

DISTRIBUTION AND SALES, INCREASED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON OWNED AUTOMOBILES SUBJECT TO OPERATING

LEASES AND A $40 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A STUDENT LOAN JOINT VENTURE. EXPENSE

SAVINGS ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES PROVIDED A FAVORABLE OFFSET.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $2.2 BILLION, UP FROM $1.5 BILLION A YEAR AGO. THE INCREASE WAS DUE LARGELY

TO THE MERGER. EXCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF THE MERGER, EARNINGS DECLINED AS LOWER MSR RISK MANAGEMENT

RESULTS AND REDUCED PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE OFFSET THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH IN LOAN

BALANCES, WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT COSTS.

TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED TO $10.8 BILLION, UP 45% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INTEREST INCOME

INCREASED BY 48% TO $7.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, GROWTH IN RETAINED LOAN BALANCES AND

WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSIT PRODUCTS. NONINTEREST REVENUE INCREASED TO $3.1 BILLION, UP 39%, DUE TO

THE MERGER AND HIGHER MORTGAGE SERVICING INCOME. BOTH COMPONENTS OF TOTAL REVENUE INCLUDED DECLINES

ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGING THE MSR ASSET AND LOWER PRIME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS DOWN 14% TO $449 MILLION DESPITE THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE

EFFECT OF THE MERGER WAS OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE

SALE OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND CONTINUED POSITIVE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS IN THE

CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED $6.8 BILLION, UP 53% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER

AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT TO EXPAND THE BRANCH NETWORK. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE WERE

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSE SAVINGS IN ALL BUSINESSES.

HOME FINANCE

HOME FINANCE IS COMPRISED OF TWO KEY BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PRIME PRODUCTION & SERVICING AND

CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING. THE PRIME PRODUCTION & SERVICING SEGMENT INCLUDES THE OPERATING

RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINATION, SALE AND SERVICING OF PRIME MORTGAGES. CONSUMER REAL

ESTATE LENDING REFLECTS THE OPERATING RESULTS OF CONSUMER LOANS THAT ARE SECURED BY REAL ESTATE,

RETAINED BY THE FIRM AND HELD IN THE PORTFOLIO. THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PRIME AND SUBPRIME FIRST

MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LINES AND LOANS, AND MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS. THE FIRM STOPPED ORIGINATING

MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS EARLY IN 2004 AND SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REMAINING PORTFOLIO IN

2004.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE PAGE 42 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $1.4 BILLION, UP $236 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES, REDUCED EXPENSES AND IMPROVED MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS.

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE PRIME PRODUCTION & SERVICING SEGMENT TOTALED $422 MILLION, UP $182

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. NET REVENUE OF $1.6 BILLION INCREASED BY $118 MILLION, REFLECTING

IMPROVED MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS. THE INCREASE IN MSR RISK MANAGEMENT RESULTS WAS DUE IN PART

TO THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR SECURITIES LOSSES ON REPOSITIONING OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT ASSET.

DECREASED MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER VOLUME PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS BENEFIT.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $943 MILLION DECREASED BY $172 MILLION, REFLECTING LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUME

AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $54 MILLION TO $935

MILLION. THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED A LOSS OF $120 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFER OF $3.3

BILLION OF MORTGAGE LOANS TO HELD-FOR-SALE, AND A $140 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO

HURRICANE KATRINA. PRIOR-YEAR RESULTS INCLUDED A $95 MILLION NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE

OF A $4.0 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO AND A $52 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO A TRANSFER

OF ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS TO HELD-FOR-SALE. EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS,

EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN UP $242 MILLION, REFLECTING THE MERGER, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND LOWER

EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOAN SPREAD COMPRESSION DUE TO RISING SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND A

FLAT YIELD CURVE, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO ACCELERATED HOME EQUITY LOAN PAYOFFS.

HOME FINANCE USES A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES, AFS SECURITIES AND TRADING SECURITIES TO MANAGE

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET. THESE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE INTENDED TO

PROTECT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE MSR ASSET BY PROVIDING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSTRUMENTS USED IN THIS RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY CHANGE OVER TIME AS MARKET CONDITIONS AND APPROACH DICTATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

DURING 2005, POSITIVE MSR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $777 MILLION WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES

OF $494 MILLION ON RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING NET INTEREST EARNED ON AFS SECURITIES. IN

2004, NEGATIVE MSR VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $248 MILLION WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $361 MILLION OF

AGGREGATE RISK MANAGEMENT GAINS, INCLUDING NET INTEREST EARNED ON AFS SECURITIES. UNREALIZED LOSSES

ON AFS SECURITIES WERE $174 MILLION, $3 MILLION AND $144 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSRS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ON PAGE 83 AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE PRIME PRODUCTION & SERVICING SEGMENT DROPPED TO $240 MILLION FROM $918

MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS REFLECTED A DECREASE IN PRIME MORTGAGE PRODUCTION REVENUE, TO

$728 MILLION FROM $1.3 BILLION, DUE TO A DECLINE IN MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. OPERATING EARNINGS WERE

ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A DROP IN MSR RISK MANAGEMENT REVENUE, TO $113 MILLION FROM $784 MILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS IN 2004 INCLUDED REALIZED LOSSES OF $89 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AFS

SECURITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK MANAGEMENT OF THE MSR ASSET, COMPARED WITH SECURITIES GAINS OF

$359 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT $1.1 BILLION.

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING SEGMENT MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $881 MILLION

FROM $414 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF THE BANK ONE

HOME EQUITY LENDING BUSINESS BUT ALSO REFLECTED GROWTH IN RETAINED LOAN BALANCES AND A $95 MILLION

NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE $4 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO; PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE LOWER SUBPRIME MORTGAGE SECURITIZATION GAINS AS A RESULT OF

MANAGEMENTS DECISION IN 2004 TO RETAIN THESE LOANS. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO TOTAL NET REVENUE

RISING 61% TO $2.4 BILLION. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, AT $74 MILLION, DECREASED BY 69% FROM

A YEAR AGO. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS THE RESULT OF AN $87 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO SALE, IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY AND LOWER

DELINQUENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE MERGER. NONINTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED $922 MILLION, UP 52%

FROM THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, LARGELY DUE TO THE MERGER.

HOME FINANCES ORIGINATION CHANNELS ARE COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING.

RETAIL

 BORROWERS WHO ARE BUYING OR REFINANCING A HOME ARE DIRECTLY CONTACTED BY A MORTGAGE

BANKER EMPLOYED BY THE FIRM USING A BRANCH OFFICE, THE INTERNET OR BY PHONE. BORROWERS ARE

FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO A MORTGAGE BANKER BY REAL ESTATE BROKERS, HOME BUILDERS OR OTHER THIRD

PARTIES.

WHOLESALE

 A THIRD-PARTY MORTGAGE BROKER REFERS LOAN APPLICATIONS TO A MORTGAGE BANKER AT THE

FIRM. BROKERS ARE INDEPENDENT LOAN ORIGINATORS THAT SPECIALIZE IN FINDING AND COUNSELING BORROWERS

BUT DO NOT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR LOANS.

CORRESPONDENT

 BANKS, THRIFTS, OTHER MORTGAGE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SELL CLOSED

LOANS TO THE FIRM.

CORRESPONDENT NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS (CNT)

 MID- TO LARGE-SIZED MORTGAGE LENDERS, BANKS AND

BANK-OWNED MORTGAGE COMPANIES SELL SERVICING TO THE FIRM ON AN AS-ORIGINATED BASIS. THESE

TRANSACTIONS SUPPLEMENT TRADITIONAL PRODUCTION CHANNELS AND PROVIDE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

SERVICING PORTFOLIO IN STABLE AND RISING-RATE PERIODS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS TOTALED $1.7 BILLION, UP $924 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. WHILE GROWTH LARGELY

REFLECTED THE MERGER, RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED INCREASED DEPOSIT BALANCES AND WIDER SPREADS, AS WELL

AS HIGHER DEBIT CARD AND OTHER BANKING FEES. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO NET REVENUE INCREASING TO

$8.4 BILLION FROM $5.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $214 MILLION

INCREASED BY $49 MILLION; EXCLUDING THE SPECIAL PROVISION OF $90 MILLION RELATED TO HURRICANE

KATRINA, THE PROVISION WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $41 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER

NET CHARGE-OFFS AND IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS. NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY $1.5 BILLION

TO $5.4 BILLION, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN BRANCH DISTRIBUTION AND

SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MERGER EFFICIENCIES.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS TOTALED $760 MILLION, UP FROM A LOSS OF $4 MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE

INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED WIDER SPREADS ON DEPOSITS AND LOWER

EXPENSES. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $5.4 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.4 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WHILE THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER, TOTAL NET REVENUE ALSO BENEFITED FROM WIDER

SPREADS ON DEPOSITS.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES INCREASED TO $165 MILLION FROM $76 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE WAS IN PART DUE TO THE MERGER BUT ALSO REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES TO COVER HIGH-RISK PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS.

THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE TO $4.0 BILLION WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER.

INCREMENTAL EXPENSE FROM INVESTMENT IN THE BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING

FACTOR.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

CARD SERVICES

CARD SERVICES IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUERS OF CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH MORE

THAN 110 MILLION CARDS IN CIRCULATION, AND IS THE LARGEST MERCHANT ACQUIRER. CS OFFERS A WIDE

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF ITS CARDMEMBERS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED ON BEHALF OF

MANY WELL-KNOWN PARTNERS, SUCH AS MAJOR AIRLINES, HOTELS, UNIVERSITIES, RETAILERS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE USES THE CONCEPT OF MANAGED RECEIVABLES TO EVALUATE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE

UNDERLYING CREDIT CARD LOANS, BOTH SOLD AND NOT SOLD: AS THE SAME BORROWER IS CONTINUING TO USE THE

CREDIT CARD FOR ONGOING CHARGES, A BORROWERS CREDIT PERFORMANCE WILL AFFECT BOTH THE RECEIVABLES

SOLD UNDER SFAS 140 AND THOSE NOT SOLD. THUS, IN ITS DISCLOSURES REGARDING MANAGED RECEIVABLES,

JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN ORDER TO

DISCLOSE THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE (SUCH AS NET CHARGE-OFF RATES) OF THE ENTIRE MANAGED CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO.

OPERATING RESULTS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON REVENUE, THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES, NET CHARGE-OFFS AND RECEIVABLES. SECURITIZATION DOES NOT CHANGE REPORTED NET INCOME

VERSUS OPERATING EARNINGS; HOWEVER, IT DOES AFFECT THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TO OPERATING EARNINGS.

(C)

2005 INCLUDES A $100 MILLION SPECIAL PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.9 BILLION WERE UP $633 MILLION, OR 50%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE

MERGER. IN ADDITION, LOWER EXPENSES DRIVEN BY MERGER SAVINGS, STRONGER UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY

AND HIGHER REVENUE FROM INCREASED LOAN BALANCES AND CHARGE VOLUME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

IMPACT OF INCREASED BANKRUPTCIES.

NET REVENUE WAS $15.4 BILLION, UP $4.6 BILLION, OR 43%. NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $11.8 BILLION, UP

$3.4 BILLION, OR 41%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, AND THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE LABEL

PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS AND THE

REVERSAL OF REVENUE RELATED TO INCREASED BANKRUPTCIES. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $3.6 BILLION WAS UP

$1.2 BILLION, OR 50%, DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER INTERCHANGE INCOME FROM HIGHER CHARGE VOLUME,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, HIGHER EXPENSE RELATED TO REWARDS

PROGRAMS AND THE IMPACT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $7.3 BILLION, UP $2.5 BILLION, OR 51%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER, AND INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO. THE PROVISION ALSO INCREASED DUE

TO RECORD BANKRUPTCY-RELATED NET CHARGE-OFFS RESULTING FROM THE NEW BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION, WHICH

BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 17, 2005. FINALLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS INCREASED IN PART

BY THE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA. THESE FACTORS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CONTRACTUAL NET CHARGE-OFFS. DESPITE A RECORD LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY LOSSES,

THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE IMPROVED. THE MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WAS 5.21%, DOWN FROM 5.27% IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE 30-DAY MANAGED DELINQUENCY RATE WAS 2.79%, DOWN FROM 3.70% IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACCELERATED LOSS RECOGNITION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS AS A RESULT OF THE

BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION AND STRONG UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $5.0 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.1 BILLION, OR 29%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER,

WHICH INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE LABEL PORTFOLIO. MERGER SAVINGS, INCLUDING LOWER

PROCESSING AND COMPENSATION COSTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH, WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING ON MARKETING.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.3 BILLION INCREASED BY $591 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND CHARGE

VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND HIGHER EXPENSES.

TOTAL NET REVENUE OF $10.7 BILLION INCREASED BY $4.6 BILLION. NET INTEREST INCOME OF $8.4 BILLION

INCREASED BY $3.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND HIGHER LOAN BALANCES. NONINTEREST

REVENUE OF $2.4 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND INCREASED

INTERCHANGE INCOME RESULTING FROM HIGHER CHARGE-OFF VOLUME. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER VOLUME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS TO PARTNERS, REFLECTING THE SHARING OF INCOME AND INCREASED REWARDS

EXPENSE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $4.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.9 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER AND GROWTH IN CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES. CREDIT RATIOS REMAINED STRONG, BENEFITING FROM

REDUCED CONTRACTUAL AND BANKRUPTCY CHARGE-OFFS. THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO WAS 5.27%. THE 30-DAY

DELINQUENCY RATIO WAS 3.70%.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $3.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES AND VOLUME-BASED PROCESSING EXPENSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSES.

THREE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS, COMMERCIAL BANKING OFFERS SEVERAL PRODUCTS TO THE FIRMS ENTIRE CUSTOMER

BASE: CHASE BUSINESS CREDIT, THE #1 ASSET-BASED LENDER FOR 2005, PROVIDES ASSET-BASED FINANCING,

SYNDICATIONS, AND COLLATERAL ANALYSIS, AND CHASE EQUIPMENT LEASING OFFERS A VARIETY OF EQUIPMENT

FINANCE AND LEASING PRODUCTS, WITH SPECIALTIES IN AIRCRAFT FINANCE, PUBLIC SECTOR, AND INFORMATION

THAT IS HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $1.0 BILLION WERE UP $399 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER.

NET REVENUE OF $3.6 BILLION INCREASED BY $1.2 BILLION, OR 51%, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.

IN ADDITION TO THE OVERALL INCREASE FROM THE MERGER, NET INTEREST INCOME OF $2.6 BILLION WAS

POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY WIDER SPREADS ON HIGHER VOLUME RELATED TO LIABILITY BALANCES AND INCREASED

LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS. NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $986 MILLION WAS LOWER DUE

TO A DECLINE IN DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE.

EACH BUSINESS WITHIN COMMERCIAL BANKING DEMONSTRATED REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE MERGER. MIDDLE MARKET REVENUE WAS $2.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $870 MILLION OVER THE

PRIOR YEAR; MID-CORPORATE BANKING REVENUE WAS $548 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $181 MILLION; AND REAL

ESTATE REVENUE WAS $534 MILLION, UP $166 MILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE MERGER, REVENUE WAS HIGHER FOR

EACH BUSINESS DUE TO WIDER SPREADS AND HIGHER VOLUME RELATED TO LIABILITY BALANCES AND INCREASED

INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NARROWER LOAN SPREADS.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $73 MILLION INCREASED BY $32 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SPECIAL

PROVISION RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, INCREASED LOAN BALANCES AND REFINEMENTS IN THE DATA USED TO

ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS STRONG WITH NET

CHARGE-OFFS OF $26 MILLION, DOWN $35 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AND NONPERFORMING LOANS OF $272

MILLION, DOWN $255 MILLION.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $529 MILLION, OR 39%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER

AND TO AN INCREASE IN ALLOCATED UNIT COSTS FOR TREASURY SERVICES PRODUCTS.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $608 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 98%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $2.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 76%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. IN ADDITION TO

THE OVERALL INCREASE RELATED TO THE MERGER, NET INTEREST INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION WAS POSITIVELY

AFFECTED BY HIGHER LIABILITY BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LENDING-RELATED REVENUE.

NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $682 MILLION WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER INVESTMENT BANKING FEES AND

HIGHER GAINS ON THE SALE OF LOANS AND SECURITIES ACQUIRED IN SATISFACTION OF DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES, WHICH OFTEN DECLINE AS INTEREST RATES RISE.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $41 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $35 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

MERGER. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, THE PROVISION WAS HIGHER IN 2004. LOWER NET CHARGE-OFFS

IN 2004 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SMALLER REDUCTIONS IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN 2004

RELATIVE TO 2003.

CONSIDERATION.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $1.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $597 MILLION, OR 136%. PRIMARILY DRIVING THE

IMPROVEMENT IN REVENUE WERE THE MERGER, BUSINESS GROWTH, AND WIDENING SPREADS ON AND GROWTH IN

COMPENSATION EXPENSE. RESULTS FOR 2005 ALSO INCLUDED CHARGES OF $58 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) TO

TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT. RESULTS FOR 2004 ALSO INCLUDED SOFTWARE-IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $97

MILLION (AFTER-TAX) AND A GAIN OF $10 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) ON THE SALE OF A BUSINESS.

TSS NET REVENUE OF $6.2 BILLION INCREASED $1.4 BILLION, OR 28%. NET INTEREST INCOME GREW TO $2.1

BILLION, UP $679 MILLION, DUE TO WIDER SPREADS ON LIABILITY BALANCES, A CHANGE IN THE CORPORATE

DEPOSIT PRICING METHODOLOGY IN 2004 AND GROWTH IN AVERAGE LIABILITY BALANCES. NONINTEREST REVENUE

OF $4.2 BILLION INCREASED BY $705 MILLION, OR 20%, DUE TO PRODUCT GROWTH ACROSS TSS, THE MERGER AND

THE ACQUISITION OF VASTERA. LEADING THE PRODUCT REVENUE GROWTH WAS AN INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER

CUSTODY TO $11.2 TRILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MARKET VALUE APPRECIATION AND NEW BUSINESS, ALONG

WITH GROWTH IN WHOLESALE CARD, SECURITIES LENDING, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRUST PRODUCT, TRADE, CLEARING

AND ACH REVENUES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS GROWTH IN NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS A DECLINE IN

DEPOSIT-RELATED FEES DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND THE ABSENCE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, OF A GAIN

ON THE SALE OF A BUSINESS.

TS NET REVENUE OF $2.6 BILLION GREW BY $628 MILLION, INVESTOR SERVICES NET REVENUE OF $2.2 BILLION

GREW BY $446 MILLION, AND INSTITUTIONAL TRUST SERVICES NET REVENUE OF $1.5 BILLION GREW BY $310

MILLION. TSS FIRMWIDE NET REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES TS NET REVENUE RECORDED IN OTHER LINES OF

BUSINESS, GREW TO $8.8 BILLION, UP $2.3 BILLION, OR 35%. TREASURY SERVICES FIRMWIDE NET REVENUE

GREW TO $5.2 BILLION, UP $1.6 BILLION, OR 43%.

CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT TO THE INVESTMENT BANK WAS $154 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $64 MILLION, PRIMARILY

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. TSS IS CHARGED A CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT RELATED TO CERTAIN EXPOSURES

MANAGED WITHIN THE INVESTMENT BANK CREDIT PORTFOLIO ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS SHARED WITH TSS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $4.5 BILLION WAS UP $357 MILLION, OR 9%, DUE TO THE MERGER, INCREASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS GROWTH AND THE VASTERA ACQUISITION, AND CHARGES OF

$93 MILLION TO TERMINATE A CLIENT CONTRACT. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE HIGHER

PRODUCT UNIT COSTS CHARGED TO OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL BANKING, LOWER

ALLOCATIONS OF CORPORATE SEGMENT EXPENSES, MERGER SAVINGS AND BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES. THE PRIOR YEAR

INCLUDED SOFTWARE-IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $155 MILLION.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR WERE $440 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $18 MILLION, OR 4%. RESULTS IN

2004 INCLUDE AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $10 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AN IS BUSINESS. PRIOR-YEAR RESULTS

INCLUDE AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $22 MILLION ON THE SALE OF AN ITS BUSINESS. EXCLUDING THESE ONE-TIME

GAINS, OPERATING EARNINGS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $30 MILLION, OR 8%. BOTH NET REVENUE AND

NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE ACQUISITION OF BANK ONES

CORPORATE TRUST BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2003 AND THE ACQUISITION OF ELECTRONIC FINANCIAL SERVICES

(EFS) IN JANUARY 2004.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $3.9 BILLION INCREASED BY $727 MILLION, OR 23%, REFLECTING THE MERGER, THE

ACQUISITION OF HIGHBRIDGE AND INCREASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED PRIMARILY TO HIGHER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $681 MILLION, UP 137% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE LARGELY TO THE MERGER BUT

ALSO DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES; THESE WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS $4.2 BILLION, UP 41%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. ADDITIONALLY, FEES AND

COMMISSIONS INCREASED DUE TO GLOBAL EQUITY MARKET APPRECIATION, NET ASSET INFLOWS AND THE

ACQUISITION OF JPMORGAN RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES (RPS) IN 2003. FEES AND COMMISSIONS ALSO

INCREASED DUE TO AN IMPROVED PRODUCT MIX, WITH AN INCREASED PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS IN HIGHER-YIELDING

PRODUCTS. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO DEPOSIT AND LOAN GROWTH.

THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS A BENEFIT OF $14 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $49 MILLION, DUE TO AN

IMPROVEMENT IN CREDIT QUALITY.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $3.1 BILLION, UP 26%, DUE TO THE MERGER, INCREASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND

INCREASED TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING INITIATIVES.

IN 2005, THE CORPORATE SECTORS AND THE FIRMS OPERATING RESULTS WERE PRESENTED ON A

TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED. THIS RESTATEMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON

THE CORPORATE SECTORS OR THE FIRMS OPERATING EARNINGS.

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

OPERATING LOSS OF $1.7 BILLION DECLINED FROM EARNINGS OF $61 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE WAS A LOSS OF $1.1 BILLION COMPARED WITH REVENUE OF $885 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST REVENUE OF $1.6 BILLION DECREASED BY $491 MILLION AND INCLUDED SECURITIES LOSSES OF

$1.5 BILLION DUE TO THE REPOSITIONING OF THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATES, THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO OF $1.3 BILLION AND THE INCREASE IN PRIVATE EQUITY

GAINS OF $262 MILLION. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SALE OF BROWNCO, SEE NOTE 2 ON PAGE 93 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS A LOSS OF $2.7 BILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $1.2 BILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. ACTIONS AND POLICIES ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER AND THE REPOSITIONING OF THE

TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED LOSS.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE WAS $2.0 BILLION, UP $723 MILLION, OR 56%, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE MERGER AND THE COST OF THE ACCELERATED VESTING OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THESE

INCREASES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY MERGER-RELATED SAVINGS AND OTHER EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE AND IBM ANNOUNCED THE FIRMS PLANS TO REINTEGRATE THE

PORTIONS OF ITS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE  INCLUDING DATA CENTERS, HELP DESKS, DISTRIBUTED

COMPUTING, DATA NETWORKS AND VOICE NETWORKS  THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY OUTSOURCED TO IBM. IN JANUARY

2005, APPROXIMATELY 3,100 EMPLOYEES AND 800 CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRM.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE $61 MILLION, DOWN FROM EARNINGS OF $668 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NONINTEREST REVENUE WAS $2.1 BILLION, UP 57% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF

NONINTEREST REVENUE IS SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS, WHICH TOTALED $1.8 BILLION, UP 73% FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF NET GAINS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO OF $1.4 BILLION

IN 2004 COMPARED WITH $27 MILLION IN NET GAINS IN 2003. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE GAINS WERE LOWER

INVESTMENT SECURITIES GAINS IN TREASURY.

NET INTEREST INCOME WAS A LOSS OF $1.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $133 MILLION IN THE PRIOR

YEAR. THE INCREASED LOSS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTIONS AND POLICIES ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE MERGER.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $1.3 BILLION WAS UP $772 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE MERGER. THE

MERGER RESULTED IN HIGHER GROSS COMPENSATION AND NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSES. ALLOCATIONS OF

COMPENSATION AND NONCOMPENSATION EXPENSES TO THE BUSINESSES WERE LOWER THAN THE GROSS EXPENSE

INCREASE DUE TO CERTAIN POLICIES ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER, WHICH RETAIN IN CORPORATE

OVERHEAD COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE INCURRED BY THE LINES OF BUSINESS IF OPERATED ON A STAND-ALONE

BASIS, AND COSTS IN EXCESS OF THE MARKET PRICE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE CORPORATE STAFF AND

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS AREAS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PRIVATE EQUITY

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

PRIVATE EQUITYS OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR WERE $821 MILLION COMPARED WITH $602 MILLION IN

THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS IMPROVEMENT IN EARNINGS REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $262 MILLION IN PRIVATE

EQUITY GAINS TO $1.7 BILLION, A 15% REDUCTION IN NONINTEREST EXPENSES AND A $62 MILLION DECLINE IN

NET FUNDING COSTS OF CARRYING PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS. PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED

FAVORABLE MARKETS FOR INVESTMENT SALES AND RECAPITALIZATIONS, RESULTING IN NEARLY $2 BILLION OF

REALIZED GAINS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO DECLINED BY $1.3 BILLION TO $6.2

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SALES AND

RECAPITALIZATIONS OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

PRIVATE EQUITYS OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR TOTALED $602 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $290

MILLION IN 2003. THIS IMPROVEMENT REFLECTED A $1.4 BILLION INCREASE IN TOTAL PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS.

IN 2004, MARKETS IMPROVED FOR INVESTMENT SALES, RESULTING IN $1.4 BILLION OF REALIZED GAINS ON

DIRECT INVESTMENTS, COMPARED WITH REALIZED GAINS OF $535 MILLION IN 2003. NET WRITE-DOWNS ON DIRECT

INVESTMENTS WERE $192 MILLION IN 2004 COMPARED WITH NET WRITE-DOWNS OF $404 MILLION IN 2003, AS

VALUATIONS CONTINUED TO STABILIZE AMID POSITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $7.5 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $247 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

ACQUISITION OF ONE EQUITY PARTNERS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. EXCLUDING ONE EQUITY PARTNERS, THE

PORTFOLIO DECLINED AS A RESULT OF SALES OF INVESTMENTS, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS

INTENTION TO REDUCE OVER TIME THE CAPITAL COMMITTED TO PRIVATE EQUITY. SALES OF THIRD-PARTY FUND

INVESTMENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN CARRYING VALUE OF $458 MILLION, TO $641 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE INCREASE IN SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN

CLIENT-DRIVEN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

THE FIRMS DEBT AND EQUITY TRADING INSTRUMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

(INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE DEBT) AND EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE CASH INSTRUMENTS USED FOR BOTH

MARKET-MAKING AND PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE OVER DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN CLIENT-DRIVEN MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES ACROSS INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND

EQUITY MARKETS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO NOTE 3 ON PAGE 94 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

THE FIRM USES VARIOUS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY, CREDIT AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVES FOR

MARKET-MAKING, PROPRIETARY RISK-TAKING AND RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE DECLINE FROM DECEMBER 31,

2004, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER

INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY AND RISING COMMODITY

PRICES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

AND NOTE 3 ON PAGES 6374 AND

94, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES

THE AFS PORTFOLIO DECLINED BY $46.9 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO SECURITIES

SALES (AS A RESULT OF MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO REPOSITION THE TREASURY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO

MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES) AND MATURITIES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET PURCHASES. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO SECURITIES, REFER TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION AND TO NOTE 9 ON PAGES

5354 AND 103105, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS

THE $17 BILLION INCREASE IN GROSS LOANS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE OF $15 BILLION IN THE

WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY FROM THE IB, REFLECTING HIGHER BALANCES OF LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

(HFS) RELATED TO SECURITIZATION AND SYNDICATION ACTIVITIES, AND GROWTH IN THE IB CREDIT

PORTFOLIO. WHOLESALE HFS LOANS WERE $18 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, COMPARED WITH $6 BILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. FOR CONSUMER LOANS, GROWTH IN CONSUMER REAL ESTATE (PRIMARILY HOME EQUITY

LOANS) AND CREDIT CARD LOANS WAS OFFSET LARGELY BY A DECLINE IN THE AUTO PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN

CREDIT CARD LOANS PRIMARILY REFLECTED GROWTH FROM NEW ACCOUNT ORIGINATIONS AND THE ACQUISITION OF

$1.5 BILLION OF SEARS CANADA LOANS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE DECLINE IN THE AUTO PORTFOLIO

PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DIFFICULT AUTO LENDING MARKET IN 2005, $3.8 BILLION OF SECURITIZATIONS AND

WAS ALSO THE RESULT OF A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE PORTFOLIO IN 2004 THAT LED TO THE DECISIONS TO

DE-EMPHASIZE VEHICLE LEASING AND SELL A $2 BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PORTFOLIO. FOR A MORE

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, REFER TO CREDIT RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 6374 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE $293 MILLION INCREASE IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM HIGHER

MSRS DUE TO GROWTH IN THE SERVICING PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN THE VALUATION FROM

IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS; THE BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP WITH CAZENOVE; THE ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS

CANADA CREDIT CARD BUSINESS; AND THE NEOVEST AND VASTERA ACQUISITIONS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE

INCREASE WERE DECLINES FROM THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS AND CORE

DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15

ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

DEPOSITS

DEPOSITS INCREASED BY 6% FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004. RETAIL DEPOSITS INCREASED, REFLECTING GROWTH FROM

NEW ACCOUNT ACQUISITIONS AND THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL BRANCH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

WHOLESALE DEPOSITS WERE HIGHER, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUMES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

DEPOSITS, REFER TO THE RFS SEGMENT DISCUSSION AND THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES

3944 AND 6162, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON LIABILITY BALANCES,

REFER TO THE CB AND TSS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ON PAGES 4748 AND 4950, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES

LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES INCREASED BY $14.2 BILLION, OR 13%, FROM DECEMBER 31,

2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET NEW ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THE FIRM

TOOK ADVANTAGE OF NARROW CREDIT SPREADS GLOBALLY TO ISSUE OPPORTUNISTICALLY LONG-TERM DEBT AND

CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES THROUGHOUT 2005. CONSISTENT WITH ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICY, THE FIRM

RAISED FUNDS SUFFICIENT TO COVER MATURING OBLIGATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND TO SUPPORT THE

LESS LIQUID ASSETS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET. LARGE INVESTOR CASH POSITIONS AND INCREASED FOREIGN

INVESTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE CORPORATE MARKETS ALLOWED JPMORGAN CHASE TO DIVERSIFY FURTHER ITS

FUNDING ACROSS THE GLOBAL MARKETS WHILE LENGTHENING MATURITIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

FIRMS LONG-TERM DEBT ACTIVITY, SEE THE LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGES 6162 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $1.6 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2004 TO $107.2 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF NET INCOME FOR 2005 AND COMMON STOCK ISSUED UNDER

EMPLOYEE PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH DIVIDENDS, STOCK REPURCHASES, THE REDEMPTION OF $200

MILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK AND NET UNREALIZED LOSSES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL, SEE THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

THE FIRMS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS CAPITAL SUFFICIENT

TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AS MEASURED BY ECONOMIC RISK

CAPITAL, AND TO MAINTAIN WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS UNDER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM HOLDS CAPITAL ABOVE THESE REQUIREMENTS IN AMOUNTS DEEMED

APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE MANAGEMENTS REGULATORY AND DEBT RATING OBJECTIVES. THE FIRMS CAPITAL

FRAMEWORK IS INTEGRATED INTO THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING EQUITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY

THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES.



INTEGRATE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN EACH

OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.



MEASURE PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.



PROVIDE COMPARABILITY WITH PEER FIRMS FOR EACH OF THE LINES OF BUSINESS.

EQUITY FOR A LINE OF BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THE FIRM BELIEVES THE BUSINESS WOULD REQUIRE IF

IT WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY, INCORPORATING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC RISK

MEASURES, REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND CAPITAL LEVELS FOR SIMILARLY RATED PEERS. RETURN ON

EQUITY IS MEASURED AND INTERNAL TARGETS FOR EXPECTED RETURNS ARE ESTABLISHED AS A KEY MEASURE OF A

BUSINESS SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE.

FOR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, THE FIRM INITIATED A METHODOLOGY AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER FOR

ALLOCATING GOODWILL. UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY, IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND ALL OF 2005, GOODWILL

FROM THE MERGER AND FROM ANY BUSINESS ACQUISITION BY EITHER HERITAGE FIRM PRIOR TO THE MERGER WAS

ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE, AS WAS ANY ASSOCIATED EQUITY. THEREFORE, 2005 LINE OF BUSINESS EQUITY IS

NOT COMPARABLE TO EQUITY ASSIGNED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS IN PRIOR YEARS. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE

COMMON EQUITY IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE FOR 2005 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE MERGER.

RELATED TO TREASURY, PRIVATE EQUITY AND THE CORPORATE PENSION PLAN.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE FIRM EXPECTS TO REFINE ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATING CAPITAL TO

THE LINES OF BUSINESS, AND MAY CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS METHODOLOGY. THE REVISED METHODOLOGY, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, CONSIDERS FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS GOODWILL ASSOCIATED

WITH SUCH LINE OF BUSINESS

ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE MERGER. AS A RESULT OF THIS REFINEMENT, RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD

SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT WILL

HAVE HIGHER AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED IN 2006, WHILE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO THE

INVESTMENT BANK WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. IN MANAGEMENTS VIEW, THE REVISED METHODOLOGY ASSIGNS

RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL SUPPORTING

ACQUISITION-RELATED GOODWILL. AS PART OF THIS REFINEMENT IN THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY, THE

FIRM WILL ASSIGN TO THE CORPORATE SEGMENT AN

AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL EQUAL TO THE THEN-CURRENT BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL FROM AND PRIOR TO THE

MERGER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142, THE LINES OF BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT TESTING, SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 8183 AND 114116, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

ECONOMIC RISK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE ASSESSES ITS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RELATIVE TO THE UNDERLYING RISKS OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, UTILIZING INTERNAL RISK-ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES. THE FIRM ASSIGNS ECONOMIC

CAPITAL BASED PRIMARILY UPON FIVE RISK FACTORS: CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND

BUSINESS RISK FOR EACH BUSINESS; AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY

BUSINESS.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL IS ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES (INVESTMENT BANK,

COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT) AND CONSUMER

BUSINESSES (RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CARD SERVICES).

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE OVERALL WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO IS DEFINED IN TERMS OF UNEXPECTED

CREDIT LOSSES, BOTH FROM DEFAULTS AND DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE DUE TO CREDIT DETERIORATION,

MEASURED OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVEL OF CAPITALIZATION

NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A TARGETED AA SOLVENCY STANDARD. UNEXPECTED LOSSES ARE IN EXCESS OF THOSE

FOR WHICH PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE MAINTAINED. IN ADDITION TO MATURITY AND CORRELATIONS,

CAPITAL ALLOCATION IS DIFFERENTIATED BY SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF CREDIT RISK: EXPOSURE AT

DEFAULT (OR LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT), LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT, LOSS SEVERITY, AND MARKET CREDIT

SPREAD.



LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT FOR COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES IN AN OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION

IS REPRESENTED BY THE EXPECTED POSITIVE EXPOSURE BASED UPON POTENTIAL MOVEMENTS OF UNDERLYING

MARKET RATES. LOAN EQUIVALENTS FOR UNUSED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES REPRESENT THE PORTION OF AN

UNUSED COMMITMENT LIKELY, BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS.



DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS FOR ALL PUBLICLY TRADED NAMES AND

INVESTMENT BANKING CLIENTS, BY REFERENCING THE GROWING MARKET IN CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND SECONDARY

MARKET LOAN SALES. THIS METHODOLOGY PRODUCES, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, MORE ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT BY

UTILIZING A FORWARD-LOOKING MEASURE OF CREDIT RISK. THIS DYNAMIC MEASURE CAPTURES CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS AND WILL CHANGE WITH THE CREDIT CYCLE OVER TIME IMPACTING THE LEVEL OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL. FOR PRIVATELY-HELD FIRMS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKING PORTFOLIO, DEFAULT LIKELIHOOD IS BASED

UPON LONGER TERM AVERAGES OVER AN ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE.

56

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT



LOSS SEVERITY OF EXPOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE DURING

WORKOUTS, WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR COLLATERAL OR SUBORDINATION.



MARKET CREDIT SPREADS ARE USED IN THE EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN EXPOSURE VALUE DUE TO CREDIT

DETERIORATION.

CREDIT RISK CAPITAL FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A CAPITAL LEVEL SUFFICIENT

TO SUPPORT AN AA RATING, AND ITS ALLOCATION IS BASED UPON PRODUCT AND OTHER RELEVANT RISK

SEGMENTATION. ACTUAL SEGMENT LEVEL DEFAULT AND SEVERITY EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO ESTIMATE UNEXPECTED

LOSSES FOR A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL EQUIVALENT TO THE AA SOLVENCY STANDARD.

STATISTICAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OR PORTFOLIOS ARE ADJUSTED UPWARD TO ENSURE THAT CAPITAL

IS CONSISTENT WITH EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS, INCLUDING SUBORDINATION LEVELS ON MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND

CAPITAL HELD AT REPRESENTATIVE MONOLINE COMPETITORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

MARKET RISK CAPITAL

THE FIRM CALCULATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT CAPITAL SHOULD REFLECT THE

RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN

MARKET VARIABLES, SUCH AS INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, SECURITIES PRICES

AND COMMODITIES PRICES. DAILY VAR, MONTHLY STRESS-TEST RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO

DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL LEVELS. THE FIRM ALLOCATES MARKET RISK CAPITAL TO EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT WEIGHTS THAT SEGMENTS VAR AND STRESS TEST EXPOSURES. SEE

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7578 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

MARKET RISK MEASURES.

OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK USING A RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WHICH ESTIMATES OPERATIONAL RISK ON A BOTTOM-UP BASIS. THE OPERATIONAL RISK

CAPITAL MODEL IS BASED UPON ACTUAL LOSSES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIO-BASED STRESS LOSSES, WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAPITAL CALCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

OR THE POTENTIAL OFFSET AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF RISK-TRANSFER PRODUCTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES THE

MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK AND EXPECTS TO PROPOSE IT EVENTUALLY FOR

QUALIFICATION UNDER THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK.

BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL

BUSINESS RISK IS DEFINED AS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH VOLATILITY IN THE FIRMS EARNINGS DUE TO

FACTORS NOT CAPTURED BY OTHER PARTS OF ITS ECONOMIC-CAPITAL FRAMEWORK. SUCH VOLATILITY CAN ARISE

FROM INEFFECTIVE DESIGN OR EXECUTION OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES, VOLATILE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITY, CHANGING CLIENT EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS, AND RESTRUCTURING TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. FOR BUSINESS RISK, CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO EACH BUSINESS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL REVENUE VOLATILITY AND MEASURES OF FIXED AND VARIABLE EXPENSES. EARNINGS VOLATILITY

ARISING FROM OTHER RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS CREDIT, MARKET, OR OPERATIONAL RISK, IS EXCLUDED FROM THE

MEASUREMENT OF BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL, AS THOSE FACTORS ARE CAPTURED UNDER THEIR RESPECTIVE RISK

CAPITAL MODELS.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK CAPITAL

CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO PRIVATELY- AND PUBLICLY-HELD SECURITIES, THIRD-PARTY FUND INVESTMENTS AND

COMMITMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO TO COVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECLINE

IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RELATED ASSET DEVALUATIONS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL

THE FIRMS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FRB), ESTABLISHES CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARDS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY.

THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) ESTABLISHES SIMILAR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS FOR THE FIRMS NATIONAL BANKS, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND CHASE BANK USA, NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION.

THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT MAKES PERMANENT AN INTERIM RULE

ISSUED IN 2000 THAT PROVIDES REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF FOR CERTAIN CASH-COLLATERALIZED SECURITIES

BORROWED TRANSACTIONS, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 22, 2006. THE FINAL RULE ALSO BROADENS THE TYPES OF

TRANSACTIONS QUALIFYING FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF UNDER THE INTERIM RULE. ADOPTION OF THE RULE

IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CAPITAL RATIOS.

ON MARCH 1, 2005, THE FRB ISSUED A FINAL RULE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL 11, 2005, THAT

CONTINUES THE INCLUSION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO STRICTER

QUANTITATIVE LIMITS AND REVISED QUALITATIVE STANDARDS, AND BROADENS THE DEFINITION OF RESTRICTED

CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS. THE RULE PROVIDES FOR A FIVE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. AS AN INTERNATIONALLY

ACTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO THE RULES LIMITATION ON RESTRICTED CORE

CAPITAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, TO 15% OF TOTAL CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS, NET

OF GOODWILL LESS ANY ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, JPMORGAN CHASES

RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS WERE 16.5% OF TOTAL CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS

TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 15% LIMIT BY THE MARCH 31, 2009, IMPLEMENTATION DATE.

ON JULY 20, 2004, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT EXCLUDES ASSETS

OF ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED AS A RESULT OF FIN 46R FROM

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS FOR PURPOSES OF COMPUTING TIER 1 AND TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS. THE

FINAL RULE ALSO REQUIRES THAT CAPITAL BE HELD AGAINST SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY FACILITIES SUPPORTING

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. THE FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. IN

ADDITION, BOTH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ASSET QUALITY TESTS

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2005. ADOPTION OF THE RULE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL

RATIOS OF THE FIRM.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SHOW THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINED A WELL-CAPITALIZED POSITION BASED UPON

BILLION, NET COMMON STOCK ISSUED UNDER EMPLOYEE PLANS OF $1.9 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL

QUALIFYING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A DECLINE OF $716 MILLION IN THE DEDUCTION FOR

NONQUALIFYING INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS A RESULT OF AMORTIZATION. OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE

DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF $4.8 BILLION, COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES OF $3.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE IN THE

DEDUCTION FOR GOODWILL OF $418 MILLION AND THE REDEMPTION OF $200 MILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK.

STANDARDS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT IS PRESENTED IN NOTE 24 ON PAGES 121122 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

BASEL II

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION PUBLISHED THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK IN 2004 IN AN

EFFORT TO UPDATE THE ORIGINAL INTERNATIONAL BANK CAPITAL

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

57

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

ACCORD (BASEL I), IN EFFECT SINCE 1988. THE GOAL OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK IS TO IMPROVE THE

CONSISTENCY OF CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INTERNATIONALLY, MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL MORE RISK-SENSITIVE,

AND PROMOTE ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AMONG LARGE, INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. JPMORGAN CHASE SUPPORTS THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK.

U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING THE BASEL II FRAMEWORK INTO THE

EXISTING RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. JPMORGAN CHASE WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED

MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN THE U.S. BY EMPLOYING INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF CERTAIN KEY RISK DRIVERS TO

DERIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW BASEL II FRAMEWORK, JPMORGAN CHASE

WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS U.S. BANK SUPERVISORS THAT ITS INTERNAL CRITERIA MEET THE

RELEVANT SUPERVISORY STANDARDS. JPMORGAN CHASE EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED

TIMELINES WITH ALL RELEVANT BASEL II RULES.

DIVIDENDS

THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND POLICY REFLECTS JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS OUTLOOK, DESIRED

PAYOUT RATIOS, NEED TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVEL AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON ITS COMMON STOCK OF $0.34 PER SHARE.

THE FIRM CONTINUES TO TARGET A DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO OF 30-40% OF OPERATING EARNINGS OVER TIME.

STOCK REPURCHASES

ON JULY 20, 2004, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INITIAL STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $6.0 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES SHARES

TO BE REPURCHASED TO OFFSET ISSUANCES UNDER THE FIRMS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED PLANS. THE ACTUAL

AMOUNT OF SHARES REPURCHASED IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS; LEGAL

CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASE ACTIVITY; THE FIRMS CAPITAL POSITION

(TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES); INTERNAL CAPITAL GENERATION; AND ALTERNATIVE

POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, DURING 2005, THE FIRM

REPURCHASED 93.5 MILLION SHARES FOR $3.4 BILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $36.46. DURING

2004, THE FIRM REPURCHASED 19.3 MILLION SHARES FOR $738 MILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF

$38.27. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, $1.9 BILLION OF AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE CAPACITY REMAINED.

THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT IT MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO WRITTEN TRADING PLANS UNDER RULE

10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. A RULE 10B5-1 REPURCHASE PLAN

WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO REPURCHASE SHARES DURING PERIODS WHEN IT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE

REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK  FOR EXAMPLE, DURING INTERNAL TRADING BLACK-OUT PERIODS. ALL PURCHASES

UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED PLAN THAT IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE

FIRM IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING REPURCHASES OF THE FIRMS EQUITY SECURITIES, SEE PART II, ITEM

5, MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF

EQUITY SECURITIES, ON PAGE 11 OF JPMORGAN CHASES 2005 FORM 10-K.

OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), LINES OF CREDIT AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. THE PRINCIPAL USES OF SPES

ARE TO OBTAIN SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS CLIENTS BY SECURITIZING FINANCIAL

ASSETS, AND TO CREATE OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR CLIENTS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT

PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING INVESTORS ACCESS TO

SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, SPES ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MARKETS FOR

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE PURCHASE OF

THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. TO INSULATE INVESTORS FROM CREDITORS OF OTHER

ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SELLER OF ASSETS, SPES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS INVOLVED WITH SPES IN THREE BROAD CATEGORIES: LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, MULTI-SELLER

CONDUITS AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION. CAPITAL IS HELD, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AGAINST ALL SPE-RELATED

TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SUCH AS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SPES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE NOTE 1 ON

PAGE 91, NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGES 111113 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRM HAS NO COMMITMENTS TO ISSUE ITS OWN STOCK TO SUPPORT ANY SPE TRANSACTION, AND ITS POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT TRANSACTIONS WITH SPES BE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH AND REFLECT MARKET PRICING.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY, NO JPMORGAN CHASE EMPLOYEE IS PERMITTED TO INVEST IN SPES WITH WHICH

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WHERE SUCH INVESTMENT WOULD VIOLATE THE

FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT.

THESE RULES PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM SELF-DEALING AND PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES FROM ACTING ON BEHALF OF

THE FIRM IN TRANSACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY OR THEIR FAMILY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INTEREST.

FOR CERTAIN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES, THE FIRM COULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FUNDING IF THE

CREDIT RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED BELOW SPECIFIC LEVELS, PRIMARILY P-1, A-1 AND

F1 FOR MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF THESE LIQUIDITY

COMMITMENTS WAS $71.3 BILLION AND $79.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

ALTERNATIVELY, IF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK WERE DOWNGRADED, THE FIRM COULD BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER

LIQUIDITY PROVIDER IN LIEU OF PROVIDING FUNDING UNDER THE LIQUIDITY COMMITMENT, OR, IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD FACILITATE THE SALE OR REFINANCING OF THE ASSETS IN THE SPE IN ORDER TO

PROVIDE LIQUIDITY.

OF ITS $71.3 BILLION IN LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, $38.9 BILLION WAS

INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS,

INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. OF THE $79.4 BILLION OF LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, $47.7 BILLION WAS INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS OTHER UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATION OF MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46R, $32.4 BILLION OF THESE COMMITMENTS, COMPARED WITH $31.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE, AS THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OF THE SPES HAVE

BEEN INCLUDED ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE FIRM ALSO HAS EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN SPES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS; THESE TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

(I.E., MTM GAINS AND LOSSES) RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE. SUCH MTM GAINS AND LOSSES ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE REVENUE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN REVENUE INFORMATION RELATED TO VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(VIES) WITH WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT, AND QUALIFYING SPES (QSPES). THE

REVENUE REPORTED IN THE TABLE BELOW PRIMARILY REPRESENTS SERVICING AND CUSTODIAL FEE INCOME. FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF VIES AND QSPES, SEE NOTE 1, NOTE 13 AND NOTE 14, ON PAGES 91, 108111 AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES

JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES) TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE CREDIT RISK SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DRAW DOWN THE

COMMITMENT OR THE FIRM FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE GUARANTEE, AND THE COUNTERPARTY

SUBSEQUENTLY FAILS TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. MOST OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING FOR THEM, SEE

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 6372 AND NOTE 27 ON PAGES 124125 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT MAY

REQUIRE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS. COMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CONTRACTS

TO PURCHASE FUTURE SERVICES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO REAL ESTATE-RELATED OBLIGATIONS

AND EQUIPMENT.

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE SUMMARIZES, BY REMAINING MATURITY, JPMORGAN CHASES OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2005. CONTRACTUAL PURCHASES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE TABLE BELOW REFLECT THE MINIMUM

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION UNDER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS WITH CONTRACT TERMS THAT ARE BOTH FIXED

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

59

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTROLS AND ONGOING

MANAGEMENT OF THE MAJOR RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR AND REPORT RISK IS CRITICAL TO BOTH

SOUNDNESS AND PROFITABILITY.



RISK IDENTIFICATION.

THE FIRM IDENTIFIES RISK BY DYNAMICALLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS ON TRANSACTIONS AND POSITIONS. BUSINESS AND RISK PROFESSIONALS

DEVELOP APPROPRIATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR THE IDENTIFIED RISKS.



RISK MEASUREMENT

: THE FIRM MEASURES RISK USING A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING CALCULATING

PROBABLE LOSS, UNEXPECTED LOSS AND VALUE-AT-RISK, AND BY CONDUCTING STRESS TESTS AND MAKING

COMPARISONS TO EXTERNAL BENCHMARKS. MEASUREMENT MODELS AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUTINELY

REVIEWED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE FIRMS RISK ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND REFLECTIVE OF

UNDERLYING POSITIONS.



RISK MONITORING/CONTROL.

THE FIRM ESTABLISHES RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THESE

POLICIES CONTAIN APPROVED LIMITS BY CUSTOMER, PRODUCT AND BUSINESS THAT ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY,

WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS AS APPROPRIATE.



RISK REPORTING.

RISK REPORTING COVERS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND IS PROVIDED TO MANAGEMENT ON A

DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS AS APPROPRIATE.

RISK GOVERNANCE

THE FIRMS RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS BUILT UPON THE PREMISE THAT EACH LINE OF BUSINESS IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE RISKS INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THERE ARE EIGHT MAJOR RISK

TYPES IDENTIFIED IN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OF THE FIRM: LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL

AND REPUTATION RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK. AS PART OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT

STRUCTURE, EACH LINE OF BUSINESS HAS A RISK COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO RISK

STRATEGY, POLICIES AND CONTROL. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE RISK COMMITTEES ESCALATE RISK ISSUES TO THE

FIRMS OPERATING COMMITTEE, COMPRISED OF SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE FIRM, OR TO THE RISK WORKING GROUP,

A SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE.

OVERLAYING RISK MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE THREE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS: TREASURY,

RISK MANAGEMENT AND OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL. TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING,

MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRM. RISK

MANAGEMENT, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER REPORTING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

PROVIDES AN INDEPENDENT FIRMWIDE FUNCTION OF CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK. WITHIN RISK MANAGEMENT

ARE THOSE UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, PRIVATE EQUITY RISK AND

RISK TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK

POLICY AND METHODOLOGY, RISK REPORTING AND RISK EDUCATION. THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL HAS

OVERSIGHT FUNCTION FOR LEGAL, REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE SIX LINES OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES AND THESE CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, THE FIRM

MAINTAINS AN ASSET & LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO), WHICH OVERSEES INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK,

AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE FIRMS FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING POLICY, THROUGH WHICH LINES OF

BUSINESS TRANSFER INTEREST RATE RISK TO TREASURY. TREASURY HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR

ALCO POLICIES AND CONTROL AND TRANSFERS AGGREGATE RISK POSITIONS TO THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE, WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING THE RISK. THERE IS ALSO AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, WHICH REVIEWS KEY ASPECTS OF THE FIRMS GLOBAL M&A

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN FOR ITS OWN INVESTMENT ACCOUNT AND THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF

THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER PRINCIPAL FINANCE ACTIVITIES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXERCISES ITS OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AS A WHOLE AND

THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENTS

RESPONSIBILITIES TO ASSESS AND MANAGE THE FIRMS RISKS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

60

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE

PROCESS BY WHICH RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN. IN ADDITION, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

REVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS RELIED UPON

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PROCESSES. BOTH COMMITTEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF REPUTATION RISK. THE CHIEF RISK

OFFICER AND OTHER MANAGEMENT REPORT ON THE RISKS OF THE FIRM TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE BOARDS RISK POLICY COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE MAJOR RISK TYPES

IDENTIFIED BY THE FIRM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

LIQUIDITY RISK ARISES FROM THE GENERAL FUNDING NEEDS OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE MANAGEMENT

OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. JPMORGAN CHASES LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO

MAXIMIZE LIQUIDITY ACCESS AND MINIMIZE FUNDING COSTS. THROUGH ACTIVE LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, THE FIRM

SEEKS TO PRESERVE STABLE, RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING. THIS ENABLES THE FIRM TO

REPLACE MATURING OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND FUND ASSETS AT APPROPRIATE MATURITIES AND RATES. TO

ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, MANAGEMENT USES A VARIETY OF LIQUIDITY RISK MEASURES THAT TAKE INTO

CONSIDERATION MARKET CONDITIONS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THE DESIRED

MATURITY PROFILE OF LIABILITIES.

GOVERNANCE

THE ASSET & LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO) REVIEWS THE FIRMS OVERALL LIQUIDITY POLICY AND OVERSEES

THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE ALCO ALSO PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO SPES, WITH

PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM MAY HAVE TO THOSE

SPES.

TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FORMULATING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY STRATEGY AND TARGETS, UNDERSTANDING

THE FIRMS ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS, PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE, OVERSEEING

POLICY ADHERENCE, AND MAINTAINING CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING. IN ADDITION, IT

IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIQUIDITY WARNING SIGNALS TO PERMIT EARLY DETECTION

OF LIQUIDITY ISSUES.

AN EXTENSION OF THE FIRMS ONGOING LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS ITS CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN. THE GOALS

OF THE PLAN ARE TO ENSURE MAINTENANCE OF APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY DURING NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS,

MEASURE AND PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS, AND MANAGE ACCESS TO FUNDING

SOURCES. THE PLAN CONSIDERS TEMPORARY AND LONG-TERM STRESS SCENARIOS WHERE ACCESS TO UNSECURED

FUNDING IS SEVERELY LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. THE PLAN FORECASTS POTENTIAL FUNDING NEEDS, TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT BOTH ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES, SEPARATELY EVALUATING ACCESS TO FUNDS BY THE

PARENT HOLDING COMPANY AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY RISK FRAMEWORK ALSO INCORPORATES TOOLS TO MONITOR THREE PRIMARY MEASURES OF

LIQUIDITY.



HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM POSITION: MEASURES THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO REPAY ALL

OBLIGATIONS WITH A MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR AT A TIME WHEN THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE PARENT COMPANY IS CONSTRAINED. HOLDING COMPANY SHORT-TERM

POSITION IS MANAGED TO A POSITIVE POSITION OVER TIME.



CASH CAPITAL SURPLUS: MEASURES THE FIRMS ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A FULLY COLLATERALIZED BASIS,

ASSUMING ACCESS TO UNSECURED FUNDING IS LOST. THIS MEASUREMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE

ILLIQUID PORTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET CAN BE FUNDED BY EQUITY, LONG-TERM DEBT, TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES AND DEPOSITS THE FIRM BELIEVES TO BE CORE.



BASIC SURPLUS: MEASURES THE BANKS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN A 90-DAY STRESS EVENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO

THE FIRM WHERE NO NEW FUNDING CAN BE RAISED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE.

EACH LIQUIDITY POSITION IS MANAGED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SURPLUS.

RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING

TREASURY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND MANAGING THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF

THE FIRM THROUGH BOTH NORMAL AND STRESS PERIODS. TREASURY ANALYZES THE DIVERSITY AND MATURITY

STRUCTURE OF THE FIRMS SOURCES OF FUNDING; AND ASSESSES DOWNGRADE IMPACT SCENARIOS, CONTINGENT

FUNDING NEEDS, AND OVERALL COLLATERAL AVAILABILITY AND PLEDGING STATUS. A DOWNGRADE ANALYSIS

CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF BOTH PARENT AND BANK LEVEL DOWNGRADES (ONE- AND TWO-NOTCH) AND CALCULATES

THE LOSS OF FUNDING AND INCREASE IN ANNUAL FUNDING COSTS FOR BOTH SCENARIOS. A TRIGGER-RISK FUNDING

ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF A BANK LEVEL DOWNGRADE THROUGH A-1/P-1 AS WELL AS THE INCREASED

CONTINGENT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE TRIGGERED. THESE LIQUIDITY ANALYTICS RELY ON

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT ABOUT JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS OR USE THEM AS COLLATERAL

FOR BORROWINGS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTS HISTORICAL DATA ON THE FUNDING OF

LOAN COMMITMENTS (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER BACK-UP FACILITIES), LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS TO SPES,

COMMITMENTS WITH RATING TRIGGERS AND COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

SPES AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL

CASH OBLIGATIONS ON PAGES 5859, AS WELL AS NOTE 1, NOTE 13, NOTE 14 AND NOTE 27 ON PAGES 91,

108111, 111113, AND 124125, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FUNDING

SOURCES OF FUNDS

CONSISTENT WITH ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICY, THE FIRM HAS RAISED FUNDS AT THE PARENT HOLDING

COMPANY SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES THAT MATURE OVER

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. LONG-TERM FUNDING NEEDS FOR THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

QUARTERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR PERIODS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINED STRONG BASED UPON ITS LIQUIDITY

METRICS. JPMORGAN CHASES LONG-DATED FUNDING, INCLUDING CORE DEPOSITS, EXCEEDS ILLIQUID ASSETS, AND THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS

OBLIGATIONS CAN BE MET EVEN IF ACCESS TO FUNDING IS IMPAIRED.

THE DIVERSITY OF THE FIRMS FUNDING SOURCES ENHANCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIMITS DEPENDENCE ON

ANY ONE SOURCE, THEREBY MINIMIZING THE COST OF FUNDS. THE DEPOSITS HELD BY THE RFS, CB AND TSS

LINES OF BUSINESS ARE A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, TOTAL DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRM WERE $555 BILLION, WHICH REPRESENTED 67% OF THE

FIRMS FUNDING LIABILITIES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FIRMS RETAIL DEPOSITS ARE CORE

DEPOSITS, WHICH ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND THEREFORE ARE CONSIDERED MORE

STABLE THAN MARKET-BASED DEPOSITS. CORE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

61

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

DEPOSITS INCLUDE ALL U.S. DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FDIC, UP TO THE LEGAL LIMIT OF $100,000 PER

DEPOSITOR. IN 2005, CORE BANK DEPOSITS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 8% FROM 2004 YEAR-END. IN ADDITION

TO CORE RETAIL DEPOSITS, THE FIRM BENEFITS FROM SUBSTANTIAL, GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CORPORATE

LIABILITY BALANCES ORIGINATED BY TSS AND CB THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE

FRANCHISE-GENERATED CORE LIABILITY BALANCES ARE ALSO A STABLE AND CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING DUE

TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESSES FROM WHICH THEY ARE GENERATED. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DEPOSIT

AND LIABILITY BALANCE TRENDS, SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS AND BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS ON PAGES

3435 AND 55, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF BOTH SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK NOTES, MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AND CAPITAL DEBT

SECURITIES. THIS FUNDING IS MANAGED CENTRALLY, USING REGIONAL EXPERTISE AND LOCAL MARKET ACCESS, TO

ENSURE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WHILE MAINTAINING CONSISTENT GLOBAL

PRICING. THESE MARKETS SERVE AS A COST-EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSIFIED SOURCE OF FUNDS AND ARE A CRITICAL

COMPONENT OF THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT. DECISIONS CONCERNING THE TIMING AND TENOR OF

ACCESSING THESE MARKETS ARE BASED UPON RELATIVE COSTS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, PROSPECTIVE VIEWS

OF BALANCE SHEET GROWTH AND A TARGETED LIQUIDITY PROFILE.

FINALLY, FUNDING FLEXIBILITY IS PROVIDED BY THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE REPO AND ASSET

SECURITIZATION MARKETS. THESE MARKETS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE

BALANCE OF SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING. THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE LOANS, AND THE ASSOCIATED GAINS

ON THOSE SECURITIZATIONS, ARE PRINCIPALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND YIELDS OF THE

ASSETS SECURITIZED AND ARE GENERALLY NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE

ISSUING ENTITY. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM AND ITS SECURITIZATION STRUCTURES ARE REFLECTED IN

JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THESE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDE RETAINED INTERESTS

IN SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, LIQUIDITY FACILITIES AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS,

SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND NOTES 13 AND 27 ON PAGES

5859, 108111 AND 124125, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ISSUANCE

CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS WIDENED MODESTLY IN 2005 ACROSS MOST INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS. ON AN

HISTORICAL BASIS, CREDIT SPREADS REMAIN NEAR HISTORIC TIGHT LEVELS AS CORPORATE BALANCE SHEET CASH

POSITIONS ARE STRONG AND CORPORATE PROFITS GENERALLY HEALTHY. JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT SPREADS

PERFORMED IN LINE WITH PEER SPREADS IN 2005.

CONTINUED STRONG FOREIGN INVESTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL CORPORATE MARKETS ALLOWED JPMORGAN

CHASE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES GLOBALLY TO FURTHER

DIVERSIFY ITS FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES

WHILE LENGTHENING MATURITIES. DURING 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $43.7 BILLION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES. THESE ISSUANCES WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY $26.9 BILLION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES THAT MATURED OR WERE REDEEMED AND THE FIRMS

REDEMPTION OF $200 MILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, IN 2005 THE FIRM SECURITIZED

APPROXIMATELY $18.1 BILLION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, $15.1 BILLION OF CREDIT CARD LOANS AND

$3.8 BILLION OF AUTOMOBILE LOANS, RESULTING IN PRE-TAX GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS OF $21 MILLION,

$101 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOAN SECURITIZATIONS, SEE

NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF UNSECURED FINANCING ARE INFLUENCED BY CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION

IN THESE RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE THE COST

OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND

COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND. CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A

STABLE AND DIVERSE

EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE

FUNDING SOURCES AND STRONG LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

IF THE FIRMS RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED BY ONE NOTCH, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE INCREMENTAL COST OF

FUNDS AND THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF FUNDING TO BE NEGLIGIBLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.

IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRM BELIEVES A DOWNGRADE IS UNLIKELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON THE IMPACT OF A CREDIT RATINGS DOWNGRADE ON THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES, AND ON

DERIVATIVES AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS, SEE SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES ON PAGES 5859 AND RATINGS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT

TO CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES, FROM LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS TO LOANS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER. THE

FIRM MANAGES THE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP OF EACH PORTFOLIO AND DISCOURAGES THE RETENTION OF LOAN

ASSETS THAT DO NOT GENERATE A POSITIVE RETURN ABOVE THE COST OF RISK-ADJUSTED CAPITAL. THE MAJORITY

OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE LOAN ORIGINATIONS (PRIMARILY TO IB CLIENTS) CONTINUES TO BE DISTRIBUTED

INTO THE MARKETPLACE, WITH RESIDUAL HOLDS BY THE FIRM AVERAGING LESS THAN 10%. WHOLESALE LOANS

GENERATED BY CB AND AWM ARE GENERALLY RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. WITH REGARD TO THE PRIME

CONSUMER CREDIT MARKET, THE FIRM FOCUSES ON CREATING A PORTFOLIO THAT IS DIVERSIFIED FROM BOTH A

PRODUCT AND A GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE. WITHIN THE PRIME MORTGAGE BUSINESS, ORIGINATED LOANS ARE

RETAINED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS WELL AS SELECTIVELY SOLD TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES; THE LATTER

CATEGORY IS ROUTINELY CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE.

CREDIT RISK ORGANIZATION

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING

COMMITTEE. THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY

FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHES A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



CALCULATES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ENSURES APPROPRIATE CREDIT RISK-BASED CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT



ASSIGNS AND MANAGES CREDIT AUTHORITIES TO APPROVE ALL CREDIT EXPOSURE



MONITORS AND

MANAGES CREDIT RISK ACROSS ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS



MANAGES CRITICIZED EXPOSURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION

THE FIRM IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH LENDING (E.G., LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS),

DERIVATIVES TRADING AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES. THE CREDIT RISK FUNCTION WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP

WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN IDENTIFYING AND AGGREGATING EXPOSURE ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TO MEASURE CREDIT RISK, THE FIRM EMPLOYS SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. LOSSES GENERATED BY CONSUMER LOANS ARE MORE PREDICTABLE THAN

WHOLESALE LOSSES, BUT ARE SUBJECT TO CYCLICAL AND SEASONAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF LOSS

IS HIGHER ON CONSUMER LOANS THAN ON WHOLESALE LOANS, THE SEVERITY OF LOSS IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND

MORE MANAGEABLE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIFFERENCES, METHODOLOGIES VARY DEPENDING ON CERTAIN FACTORS,

INCLUDING TYPE OF ASSET (E.G., CONSUMER INSTALLMENT VERSUS WHOLESALE LOAN), RISK MEASUREMENT

PARAMETERS (E.G., DELINQUENCY STATUS AND CREDIT BUREAU SCORE VERSUS WHOLESALE RISK RATING) AND RISK

MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION PROCESSES (E.G., RETAIL COLLECTION CENTER VERSUS CENTRALLY MANAGED

WORKOUT GROUPS). CREDIT RISK MEASUREMENT IS BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE SHOULD THE OBLIGOR OR

THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT, THE PROBABILITY OF

DEFAULT AND THE LOSS SEVERITY GIVEN A DEFAULT EVENT. BASED UPON THESE FACTORS AND RELATED

MARKET-BASED INPUTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES BOTH PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE AND

CONSUMER PORTFOLIOS. PROBABLE LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ARE GENERALLY

STATISTICALLY-BASED ESTIMATES OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER TIME, ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF OBLIGOR OR

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, PROBABLE LOSSES ARE NOT THE SOLE INDICATORS OF RISK. IF LOSSES WERE

ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE, THE PROBABLE LOSS RATE COULD BE FACTORED INTO PRICING AND COVERED AS A NORMAL

AND RECURRING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. UNEXPECTED LOSSES, REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF CREDIT RISK

CAPITAL, REPRESENT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF ACTUAL LOSSES RELATIVE TO THE PROBABLE LEVEL OF

LOSSES. (REFER TO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 5658 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION

OF THE CREDIT RISK CAPITAL METHODOLOGY.) RISK MEASUREMENT FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED

PRIMARILY ON A RISK-RATED BASIS; FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, IT IS ASSESSED PRIMARILY ON A

CREDIT-SCORED BASIS.

RISK-RATED EXPOSURE

FOR PORTFOLIOS THAT ARE RISK-RATED, PROBABLE AND UNEXPECTED LOSS CALCULATIONS ARE BASED UPON

ESTIMATES OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IS EXPECTED

DEFAULT CALCULATED ON AN OBLIGOR BASIS. LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT IS AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES THAT ARE BASED

UPON COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR EACH CREDIT FACILITY. CALCULATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

BASED UPON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES WHICH ARE UNDER CONTINUAL REVIEW. RISK

RATINGS ARE ASSIGNED AND REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT AND REVISED, IF

NEEDED, TO REFLECT THE BORROWERS CURRENT RISK PROFILES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL AND STRUCTURAL

POSITIONS.

CREDIT-SCORED EXPOSURE

FOR CREDIT-SCORED PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY HELD IN RFS AND CS), PROBABLE LOSS IS BASED UPON A

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INHERENT LOSSES OVER DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME. PROBABLE LOSSES ARE

ESTIMATED USING SOPHISTICATED PORTFOLIO MODELING, CREDIT SCORING AND DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS TO

PROJECT CREDIT RISKS AND ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, COMMON MEASURES OF CREDIT

QUALITY DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE ARE USED TO PREDICT CONSUMER LOSSES. OTHER RISK

CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED INCLUDE RECENT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE PORTFOLIOS, CHANGES IN ORIGINATION

SOURCES, PORTFOLIO SEASONING, LOSS SEVERITY AND UNDERLYING CREDIT PRACTICES, INCLUDING CHARGE-OFF

POLICIES. THESE ANALYSES ARE APPLIED TO THE FIRMS CURRENT PORTFOLIOS IN ORDER TO FORECAST

DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, WHICH DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE LOSSES. THESE FACTORS

AND ANALYSES ARE UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND

INTEGRITY OF DECISION-MAKING AND ENSURE CREDIT RISKS ARE ACCURATELY ASSESSED, PROPERLY APPROVED,

CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND ACTIVELY MANAGED AT BOTH THE TRANSACTION AND PORTFOLIO LEVELS. THE POLICY

FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES CREDIT APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, CONCENTRATION LIMITS, RISK-RATING METHODOLOGIES,

PORTFOLIO-REVIEW PARAMETERS AND PROBLEM-LOAN MANAGEMENT. WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK IS CONTINUALLY

MONITORED ON BOTH AN AGGREGATE PORTFOLIO LEVEL AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BASIS. FOR CONSUMER

CREDIT RISK, THE KEY FOCUS ITEMS ARE TRENDS AND CONCENTRATIONS AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PORTFOLIO

GUIDELINES. CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT MONITORS TRENDS AGAINST BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS AND

INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS. IN ORDER TO MEET CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES, THE FIRM SEEKS TO MAINTAIN

A RISK PROFILE THAT IS DIVERSE IN TERMS OF BORROWER, PRODUCT TYPE, INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC

CONCENTRATION. ADDITIONAL DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOAN

SYNDICATION AND PARTICIPATIONS, LOAN SALES, SECURITIZATIONS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

RISK-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES.

FORECASTS, HOLD-LIMIT EXCEPTIONS AND RISK PROFILE CHANGES ARE REPORTED REGULARLY TO SENIOR CREDIT

RISK MANAGEMENT. DETAILED PORTFOLIO REPORTING OF INDUSTRY, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS

OCCURS MONTHLY, AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY SENIOR

MANAGEMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THROUGH THE RISK REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE,

CREDIT RISK TRENDS AND LIMIT EXCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED REGULARLY TO, AND DISCUSSED WITH, THE

OPERATING COMMITTEE.

2005 CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW

THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCED CONTINUED CREDIT STRENGTH DURING 2005. WHOLESALE

NONPERFORMING LOANS WERE DOWN BY $582 MILLION, OR 37%, FROM 2004; NET RECOVERIES WERE $77 MILLION

COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

63

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

$186 MILLION IN 2004; AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED BY $740 MILLION, OR 21%,

REFLECTING THE QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO AT

THIS TIME. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL PROVISIONING

FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO IN 2006.

IN 2005, THE FIRM ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN THE MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REENGINEER SPECIFIC

COMPONENTS OF THE WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FIRM IS ON TARGET TO MEET THE GOALS OF

ENHANCING THE TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY OF RISK AND EXPOSURE INFORMATION AND REPORTING; MANAGEMENT OF

CREDIT RISK IN THE RETAINED PORTFOLIO; SUPPORT OF CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC

CAPITAL AND COMPLIANCE WITH BASEL II INITIATIVES.

CONSUMER CREDIT WAS IMPACTED IN 2005 BY TWO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS, HURRICANE KATRINA AND FEDERAL

BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION. HURRICANE KATRINA IMPACTED CUSTOMERS ACROSS ALL CONSUMER BUSINESSES

(AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CB AND AWM). AS A RESULT, THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS

INCREASED BY $350 MILLION ($250 MILLION IN RFS, AND $100 MILLION IN CS). IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE

MAJORITY OF CHARGE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HURRICANE WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE IN 2006.

BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 17, 2005. THIS LEGISLATION PROMPTED A

RUSH TO FILE EFFECT THAT RESULTED IN A SPIKE IN BANKRUPTCY FILINGS AND INCREASED CREDIT LOSSES,

PREDOMINANTLY IN CS, WHERE IT IS BELIEVED THAT $575 MILLION

IN ESTIMATED BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION-RELATED CREDIT LOSSES OCCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2005. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FIRST HALF OF 2006 WILL EXPERIENCE LOWER CREDIT CARD NET

CHARGE-OFFS, AS THE RECORD LEVELS OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS IN THE 2005 FOURTH QUARTER ARE BELIEVED TO

HAVE INCLUDED BANKRUPTCY FILINGS THAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN 2006. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EVENTS

NOTED ABOVE, THE 2005 UNDERLYING CREDIT PERFORMANCE, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS SEVERITY

PERFORMANCE IN RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CONTINUED TO BE STRONG. CS CONTINUES TO QUANTIFY AND REFINE

THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE FFIEC MINIMUM-PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS. ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

OF THE NEW PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS BEGAN IN LATE 2005 AND WILL RUN THROUGH EARLY 2006; CS ANTICIPATES

HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2006 AS A RESULT.

IN 2005, THE FIRM CONTINUED TO GROW THE CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO, FOCUSING ON BUSINESSES PROVIDING

THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK/REWARD RELATIONSHIP WHILE KEEPING WITHIN THE FIRMS DESIRED RISK

TOLERANCE. DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE FIRM CONTINUED A DE-EMPHASIS OF VEHICLE LEASING AND SOLD ITS

$2 BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PORTFOLIO. CONTINUED GROWTH IN MOST CORE CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS

(RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE, CREDIT CARDS AND SMALL BUSINESS) REFLECTED A FOCUS ON THE PRIME CREDIT

QUALITY SEGMENT OF THE MARKET.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004.

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, INCREASED BY $67 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE OF $11 BILLION IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND $56 BILLION IN THE

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO INCREASE,

OR $54 BILLION, WAS PRIMARILY FROM GROWTH IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. IN THE TABLE BELOW,

REPORTED LOANS INCLUDE ALL HFS LOANS, WHICH ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE WITH

CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME. HOWEVER, THESE HFS LOANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE AVERAGE

LOAN BALANCES USED FOR THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE CALCULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WHOLESALE EXPOSURE (IB, CB, TSS AND AWM) INCREASED BY $11 BILLION FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2004. INCREASES IN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WERE OFFSET PARTIALLY BY

REDUCTIONS IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AND INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES. AS DESCRIBED ON PAGES

3637 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE INCREASE IN LOANS WAS PRIMARILY IN THE IB,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE RELATED TO SECURITIZATION AND SYNDICATION ACTIVITIES

AND GROWTH IN THE IB CREDIT PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS MOSTLY DUE

TO CB ACTIVITY. THE DECREASE IN DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE APPRECIATION OF THE

U.S. DOLLAR AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RISING COMMODITY PRICES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE INVESTMENT-GRADE WHOLESALE EXPOSURE, EXCLUDING HFS,

REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004. DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR

DECREASED AS A RESULT OF THE APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR ON SHORT-DATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) CONTRACTS. THE PERCENTAGE OF

DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE GREATER THAN 5 YEARS INCREASED FROM 42% TO 56% AT YEAR-END 2005, PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF THE REDUCTION IN SHORTER-DATED EXPOSURE.

DECREASED TO $5.2 BILLION (EXCLUDING HFS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, FROM $8.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2004,

REFLECTING STRONG CREDIT QUALITY, REFINANCINGS AND GROSS CHARGE-OFFS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

DECLINE WAS A REFINEMENT IN METHODOLOGY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 TO ALIGN THE RATINGS

METHODOLOGIES OF THE HERITAGE FIRMS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AUTOMOTIVE, TELECOM SERVICES AND RETAIL AND CONSUMER SERVICES MOVED INTO THE

TOP 10 OF WHOLESALE CRITICIZED EXPOSURE, REPLACING CHEMICALS/PLASTICS, BUSINESS SERVICES AND

METALS/MINING INDUSTRIES.

WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING ASSETS

WHOLESALE NONPERFORMING ASSETS (EXCLUDING PURCHASED HELD-FOR-SALE WHOLESALE LOANS) DECREASED BY

$779 MILLION FROM $1.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, AS A RESULT OF LOAN SALES, REPAYMENTS AND GROSS CHARGE-OFFS. FOR FULL YEAR 2005,

WHOLESALE NET RECOVERIES WERE $77 MILLION COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS OF $186 MILLION IN 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GROSS CHARGE-OFFS. THE NET RECOVERY RATE FOR FULL YEAR 2005 WAS 0.06%

COMPARED WITH A NET CHARGE-OFF RATE OF 0.18% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CHARGE-OFFS DO NOT INCLUDE $67

MILLION OF GAINS FROM SALES OF NONPERFORMING LOANS THAT WERE SOLD DURING 2005 TO A COUNTER-PARTY

OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL BORROWER. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A LOAN WILL BE SOLD IT IS TRANSFERRED

INTO A HELD-FOR-SALE ACCOUNT. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE,

WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN OTHER REVENUE.

WHOLESALE SELECTED INDUSTRY DISCUSSION

PRESENTED BELOW IS A DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE

AND WHICH IT CONTINUES TO MONITOR BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CREDIT CONCERNS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLES ABOVE AND ON THE PRECEDING PAGE.



BANKS AND FINANCE COMPANIES.

THIS INDUSTRY GROUP, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL

BANKS, IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO. CREDIT QUALITY IS HIGH, AS

88% OF THE EXPOSURE IN THIS CATEGORY IS RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE.



REAL ESTATE.

THIS INDUSTRY, THE SECOND LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE CREDIT

PORTFOLIO, GREW MODESTLY IN 2005, AS THE PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM RELATIVELY LOW

INTEREST RATES, HIGH LIQUIDITY AND INCREASED CAPITAL DEMAND. THE EXPOSURE IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED BY

CLIENT, TRANSACTION TYPE, GEOGRAPHY AND PROPERTY TYPE.



OIL AND GAS.

DURING 2005, EXPOSURE TO THIS INDUSTRY GROUP INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE RISE IN

OIL AND GAS PRICES; DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM INCREASED ON CONTRACTS THAT WERE EXECUTED AT LOWER

PRICE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM EXTENDED SHORTER TERM LOANS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE REFINANCED

THROUGH CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND FURTHER SYNDICATIONS.



MEDIA.

CRITICIZED EXPOSURES WITHIN MEDIA INCREASED IN 2005, AND THIS INDUSTRY NOW REPRESENTS THE

LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL CRITICIZED PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO

THE EXTENSION OF SHORT-TERM FINANCINGS TO SELECT BORROWERS. THE REMAINING MEDIA PORTFOLIO IS

STABLE, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPOSURE RATED INVESTMENT-GRADE.



AUTOMOTIVE.

IN 2005, AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND SUPPLIERS BASED IN

NORTH AMERICA WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT,

CRITICIZED EXPOSURES TO THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY GREW, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DOWNGRADES TO SELECT

NAMES WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, THOUGH LARGER IN THE AGGREGATE, MOST OF THE CRITICIZED

EXPOSURE REMAINS UNDRAWN AND PERFORMING.



ALL OTHER.

ALL OTHER IN THE WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION TABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

EXCLUDING HFS, INCLUDED $283 BILLION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO 21 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. EXPOSURES RELATED

TO SPES AND HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS TOTALED 45% OF THIS CATEGORY. SPES PROVIDE SECURED FINANCING

(GENERALLY BACKED BY RECEIVABLES, LOANS OR BONDS ON A BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE, NON-RECOURSE OR

LIMITED-RECOURSE BASIS) ORIGINATED BY COMPANIES IN A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT

HIGHLY CORRELATED. THE REMAINING ALL OTHER EXPOSURE IS WELL DIVERSIFIED ACROSS OTHER INDUSTRIES;

NONE COMPRISE MORE THAN 3% OF TOTAL EXPOSURE.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE FIRM UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

CUSTOMERS, TO GENERATE REVENUES THROUGH TRADING ACTIVITIES, TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND OTHER MARKETS AND TO MANAGE ITS OWN CREDIT RISK. THE FIRM USES THE

SAME CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AS THOSE USED FOR ITS TRADITIONAL LENDING ACTIVITIES TO

ASSESS AND APPROVE POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURES WHEN ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS. FOR MOST

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DOES NOT CHANGE HANDS; IT IS USED SIMPLY AS

A REFERENCE TO CALCULATE PAYMENTS.

(B)

THE FIRM HELD $33 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AGAINST DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

CONSISTING OF $27 BILLION IN NET CASH RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEXES TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND $6 BILLION OF OTHER LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL. THE BENEFIT OF THE

$27 BILLION IS REFLECTED WITHIN THE $50 BILLION OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM. EXCLUDED FROM THE

$33 BILLION OF COLLATERAL IS $10 BILLION OF COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF

TRANSACTIONS; THIS COLLATERAL SECURES EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO SHOULD

THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. ALSO EXCLUDED ARE CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY RECEIVABLES.

(C)

THE FIRM HELD $41 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AGAINST DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

CONSISTING OF $32 BILLION IN NET CASH RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEXES TO LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, AND $9 BILLION OF OTHER LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL. THE BENEFIT OF THE

$32 BILLION IS REFLECTED WITHIN THE $66 BILLION OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM. EXCLUDED FROM THE

$41 BILLION OF COLLATERAL IS $10 BILLION OF COLLATERAL DELIVERED BY CLIENTS AT THE INITIATION OF

TRANSACTIONS; THIS COLLATERAL SECURES EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO SHOULD

THE MTM OF THE CLIENTS TRANSACTIONS MOVE IN THE FIRMS FAVOR. ALSO EXCLUDED ARE CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY RECEIVABLES.

THE MTM OF DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES CONTRACTS REPRESENTS THE COST TO REPLACE THE CONTRACTS AT

CURRENT MARKET RATES SHOULD THE COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS MORE THAN ONE

TRANSACTION OUTSTANDING WITH A COUNTER-PARTY, AND A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING AGREEMENT

EXISTS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NETTED MTM EXPOSURE, LESS COLLATERAL HELD, REPRESENTS, IN THE

FIRMS VIEW, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF CURRENT CREDIT RISK.

WHILE USEFUL AS A CURRENT VIEW OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE NET MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES

DOES NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE VARIABILITY OF THAT CREDIT EXPOSURE. TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL

FUTURE VARIABILITY OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, THE FIRM CALCULATES, ON A CLIENT-BY-CLIENT BASIS, THREE

MEASURES OF POTENTIAL DERIVATIVES-RELATED CREDIT LOSS: PEAK, DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE) AND

AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG). THESE MEASURES ALL INCORPORATE NETTING AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS, WHERE APPLICABLE.

PEAK EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY IS AN EXTREME MEASURE OF EXPOSURE CALCULATED AT A 97.5% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE TOTAL POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT RISK EMBEDDED IN THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO

IS NOT THE SIMPLE SUM OF ALL PEAK CLIENT CREDIT RISKS. THIS IS BECAUSE, AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL,

CREDIT RISK IS REDUCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN OFFSETTING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE WITH SEPARATE

COUNTERPARTIES, ONLY ONE OF THE TWO TRADES CAN GENERATE A CREDIT LOSS, EVEN IF BOTH COUNTERPARTIES

WERE TO DEFAULT SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIRM REFERS TO THIS EFFECT AS MARKET DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE

MARKET-DIVERSIFIED PEAK (MDP) MEASURE IS A PORTFOLIO AGGREGATION OF COUNTERPARTY PEAK MEASURES,

REPRESENTING THE MAXIMUM LOSSES AT THE 97.5% CONFIDENCE LEVEL THAT WOULD OCCUR IF ALL

COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULTED UNDER ANY ONE GIVEN MARKET SCENARIO AND TIME FRAME.

DERIVATIVE RISK EQUIVALENT (DRE) EXPOSURE IS A MEASURE THAT EXPRESSES THE RISKINESS OF DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURE ON A BASIS INTENDED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE RISKINESS OF LOAN EXPOSURES. THE MEASUREMENT

IS DONE BY EQUATING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION BOTH THE LOSS VOLATILITY AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY) WITH THE

UNEXPECTED LOSS IN A LOAN EXPOSURE (WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ONLY THE CREDIT RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY). DRE IS A LESS EXTREME MEASURE OF

POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS THAN PEAK AND IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY THE FIRM FOR CREDIT APPROVAL OF

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FINALLY, AVERAGE EXPOSURE (AVG) IS A MEASURE OF THE EXPECTED MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

RECEIVABLES AT FUTURE TIME PERIODS, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT OF COLLATERAL. AVG EXPOSURE OVER THE

TOTAL LIFE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS USED AS THE PRIMARY METRIC FOR PRICING PURPOSES AND IS

USED TO CALCULATE CREDIT CAPITAL AND THE CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT

(CVA), AS FURTHER DESCRIBED

BELOW. AVERAGE EXPOSURE WAS $36 BILLION AND $38 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES MTM NET OF OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL OF $44

BILLION AND $57 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GRAPH BELOW SHOWS EXPOSURE PROFILES TO DERIVATIVES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS AS CALCULATED BY THE

MDP, DRE AND AVG METRICS. ALL THREE MEASURES GENERALLY SHOW DECLINING EXPOSURE AFTER THE FIRST

YEAR, IF NO NEW TRADES WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO.

EXPOSURE PROFILE OF DERIVATIVES MEASURES

DECEMBER 31, 2005

(IN BILLIONS)

68

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

THE MTM VALUE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES INCORPORATES AN ADJUSTMENT, THE CVA, TO

REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF COUNTERPARTIES. THE CVA IS BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVG EXPOSURE TO A

COUNTERPARTY AND THE COUNTERPARTYS CREDIT SPREAD IN THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES MARKET. THE PRIMARY

COMPONENTS OF CHANGES IN CVA ARE CREDIT SPREADS, NEW DEAL ACTIVITY OR UNWINDS, AND CHANGES IN THE

UNDERLYING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT

IS ESSENTIAL TO CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC CREDIT RISK IN THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO. THE FIRM RISK

MANAGES EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CVA BY ENTERING INTO CREDIT DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS

INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE MTM VALUE OF THE

FIRMS DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DOES NOT INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT JPMORGAN CHASES

CREDIT QUALITY.

ENHANCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY RECEIVABLES.

THE FIRM ACTIVELY PURSUES THE USE OF COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

IN DERIVATIVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL

AGREEMENTS INCREASED SLIGHTLY, TO 81% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, FROM 79% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE

FIRM POSTED $27 BILLION AND $31 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNTERPARTY

AND/OR THE FIRM, UPON SPECIFIED DOWNGRADES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CREDIT RATINGS, TO POST COLLATERAL

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-NOTCH RATINGS

DOWNGRADE TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, FROM ITS CURRENT RATING OF AA- TO A+, WOULD HAVE BEEN AN

ADDITIONAL $1.4 BILLION OF COLLATERAL POSTED BY THE FIRM; THE IMPACT OF A SIX-NOTCH RATINGS

DOWNGRADE (FROM AA- TO BBB-) WOULD HAVE BEEN $3.8 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, GENERALLY UPON A DOWNGRADE OF

EITHER THE FIRM OR THE COUNTERPARTY, AT THE THEN-EXISTING MTM VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

DERIVATIVES; THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT REDUCE THE REPORTED LEVEL OF ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR THE

LEVEL OF REPORTED OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO DIVERSIFIES EXPOSURES BY PROVIDING

(I.E., SELLING) CREDIT PROTECTION, WHICH INCREASES EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIES OR CLIENTS WHERE THE FIRM

HAS LITTLE OR NO CLIENT-RELATED EXPOSURE. THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE FIRMS OVERALL

CREDIT EXPOSURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS LIMITED COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE AS A RESULT OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

TRANSACTIONS. OF THE $50 BILLION OF TOTAL DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION, OR 8%, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DERIVATIVES, BEFORE THE BENEFIT OF

LIQUID SECURITIES COLLATERAL.

DEALER/CLIENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTION PURCHASED AND SOLD IN THE

DEALER/CLIENT BUSINESS INCREASED $1.2 TRILLION FROM YEAR-END 2004 AS A RESULT OF INCREASED TRADE

VOLUME IN THE MARKET. THIS BUSINESS HAS A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF PROTECTION

PURCHASED AND SOLD. HOWEVER, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE RISK POSITIONS ARE LARGELY MATCHED WHEN

SECURITIES USED TO RISK MANAGE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED TO A DURATION-BASED EQUIVALENT BASIS OR TO REFLECT DIFFERENT DEGREES

OF SUBORDINATION IN TRANCHED STRUCTURES.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED BY JPMORGAN CHASE FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DO NOT

QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS 133, AND THEREFORE, EFFECTIVENESS TESTING UNDER SFAS 133 IS

NOT PERFORMED. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED AS

TRADING REVENUE. THE MTM VALUE INCORPORATES BOTH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVE PREMIUMS AND CHANGES

IN VALUE DUE TO MOVEMENT IN SPREADS AND CREDIT EVENTS; IN CONTRAST, THE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS BEING RISK-MANAGED ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOAN INTEREST AND FEES ARE

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN NET INTEREST INCOME, AND IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES. THIS ASYMMETRY IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, BETWEEN LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS AND THE CREDIT DERIVATIVES UTILIZED IN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, CAUSES EARNINGS

VOLATILITY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, OF THE TRUE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE

FIRMS OVERALL CREDIT EXPOSURE. THE MTM RELATED TO THE FIRMS CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED FOR MANAGING

RESPECTIVELY, RECOGNIZING GAINS OF $76 MILLION AND LOSSES OF $8 MILLION IN 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE FIRMS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE

UNDERTAKEN FOR LIQUIDITY AND BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS $324 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, COMPARED WITH $309 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN THE FIRMS VIEW, THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL

AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIRMS

ACTUAL CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT RISK

EXPOSURE THE FIRM HAS TO WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS USED AS THE BASIS FOR

ALLOCATING CREDIT RISK CAPITAL TO THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED A LOAN-EQUIVALENT

AMOUNT FOR EACH COMMITMENT; THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE UNUSED COMMITMENT OR OTHER

CONTINGENT EXPOSURE THAT IS EXPECTED, BASED UPON AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO BECOME

OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY AN OBLIGOR. THE LOAN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF THE FIRMS

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, WAS $178 BILLION AND $162 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

COUNTRY EXPOSURE

THE FIRM HAS A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING EXPOSURES AND RISK IN EMERGING

MARKETS COUNTRIESDEFINED AS THOSE COUNTRIES POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO SOVEREIGN EVENTS.

EXPOSURES TO A COUNTRY INCLUDE ALL CREDIT-RELATED LENDING, TRADING, AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES,

WHETHER CROSS-BORDER OR LOCALLY FUNDED. EXPOSURE AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS

(E.G., GUARANTEES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT) PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES LOCATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, IF

THE ENHANCEMENTS FULLY COVER THE COUNTRY RISK AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS RISK. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL EMERGING MARKETS COUNTRY WAS NOT MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

TOTAL MANAGED CONSUMER LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WERE $340 BILLION, UP FROM $338 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 2004. CONSUMER LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INCREASED BY 9% TO $656 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, REFLECTING GROWTH IN CREDIT CARDS AND HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE SPECIFIC LOAN AND LENDING-RELATED CATEGORIES WITHIN THE CONSUMER

PORTFOLIO.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES

AVERAGE RFS LOAN BALANCES FOR 2005 WERE $198 BILLION. NEW LOANS ORIGINATED IN 2005 REFLECT HIGH

CREDIT QUALITY CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS FOCUS ON THE PRIME CREDIT MARKET SEGMENT. THE NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE FOR RETAIL LOANS IN 2005 WAS 0.31%, A DECREASE OF 36 BASIS POINTS FROM 2004. THIS

DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO $406 MILLION OF CHARGE-OFFS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE $4.0 BILLION MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIO. EXCLUDING THESE

CHARGE-OFFS, THE NET CHARGE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE IMPROVED EIGHT BASIS POINTS.

HOME FINANCE.

HOME FINANCE LOANS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WERE $133 BILLION. THIS

AMOUNT CONSISTED OF $77 BILLION OF HOME EQUITY AND OTHER LOANS AND $56 BILLION OF MORTGAGES,

INCLUDING MORTGAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE. HOME FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, REFLECT

AN INCREASE OF $9 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2004 DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIO. HOME

FINANCE PROVIDES CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LENDING TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CREDIT BORROWERS, INCLUDING

$15 BILLION IN SUB-PRIME CREDITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. HOME FINANCE DOES NOT OFFER MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS THAT RESULT IN NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION BUT DOES OFFER MORTGAGES WITH INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENT

OPTIONS TO PREDOMINANTLY PRIME BORROWERS.

THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUTSTANDING CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LOANS IS WELL DIVERSIFIED AS SHOWN

AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE LOANS DECREASED TO

$49 BILLION FROM $63 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2004. THE DECREASE IN OUTSTANDING LOANS WAS CAUSED

PRIMARILY BY A DIFFICULT AUTO LENDING MARKET IN 2005, $3.8 BILLION IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE SALE OF

THE $2.0 BILLION RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PORTFOLIO AND THE DE-EMPHASIS OF VEHICLE LEASING, WHICH

COMPRISED $4.4 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT OVER

TIME VEHICLE LEASES WILL ACCOUNT FOR A SMALLER SHARE OF BALANCE SHEET RECEIVABLES AND EXPOSURE. THE

AUTO & EDUCATION LOAN PORTFOLIO REFLECTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF PRIME QUALITY CREDITS.

CONSUMER & SMALL BUSINESS AND OTHER.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, SMALL BUSINESS & OTHER CONSUMER LOANS

REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE AT $14.8 BILLION COMPARED WITH 2004 YEAR-END LEVELS OF $15.1 BILLION.

THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTS HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED LOANS, OFTEN WITH PERSONAL LOAN GUARANTEES.

CARD SERVICES

JPMORGAN CHASE ANALYZES THE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ON A MANAGED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THOSE RECEIVABLES SOLD TO INVESTORS THROUGH

SECURITIZATION. MANAGED CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES WERE $142 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AN INCREASE

OF $7 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2004, REFLECTING SOLID GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE ADDITION

OF $2.2 BILLION OF RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE SEARS CANADA CREDIT CARD

BUSINESS.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS REMAINED STABLE DESPITE THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED LOSSES DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 17, 2005. THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD NET

CHARGE-OFF RATE DECREASED TO 5.21% IN 2005 FROM 5.27% IN 2004. THE 30-DAY DELINQUENCY RATES

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 2.79% IN 2005 FROM 3.70% IN 2004, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACCELERATED LOSS

RECOGNITION OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS AS A RESULT OF THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION AND STRONG

UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY. THE MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO CONTINUES TO REFLECT A WELL-SEASONED

PORTFOLIO THAT HAS GOOD U.S. GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS INTENDED TO COVER PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES,

INCLUDING LOSSES WHERE THE ASSET IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT

BEEN FULLY DETERMINED. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF

RISK OFFICER OF THE FIRM, THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE, A SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, AND THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM. THE ALLOWANCE IS REVIEWED RELATIVE TO THE

RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND IS ADJUSTED IF, IN

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, CHANGES

ARE WARRANTED. THE ALLOWANCE INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT,

THE LATTER OF WHICH CONSISTS OF A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGE 81 AND NOTE 12 ON PAGES 107108 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, MANAGEMENT DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE

SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT ARE NOT

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED OR FOR WHICH THE SIZE OF THE LOSS HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY DETERMINED.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

73

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF $322 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS

DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED CREDIT STRENGTH IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE AS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL PROVISION TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2005 DUE TO HURRICANE KATRINA.

EXCLUDING HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES REPRESENTED 1.84% OF LOANS AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, COMPARED WITH 1.94% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE WHOLESALE COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE

DECREASED TO $2.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, FROM $3.1 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2004, DUE TO

STRONG CREDIT QUALITY ACROSS ALL WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. EXCLUDING THE SPECIAL PROVISION

FOR HURRICANE KATRINA, THE CONSUMER COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN $4.3 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, A SLIGHT INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT, MANAGEMENT ALSO

COMPUTES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT

FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN

PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN. THIS ALLOWANCE, WHICH IS

REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES, WAS $400 MILLION AND $492 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE REPORTED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE PAGE 29 OF THIS ANNUAL

74

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK IS THE EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN MARKET PRICES OR RATES.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (MRM) IS AN INDEPENDENT CORPORATE RISK GOVERNANCE FUNCTION THAT

IDENTIFIES, MEASURES, MONITORS, AND CONTROLS MARKET RISK. IT SEEKS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT

RISK/RETURN DECISIONS AND TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IT STRIVES TO MAKE THE

FIRMS MARKET RISK PROFILE TRANSPARENT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REGULATORS.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT IS OVERSEEN BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, A MEMBER OF THE FIRMS OPERATING

COMMITTEE. MRMS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY FUNCTIONS.



ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET RISK POLICY FRAMEWORK



INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT,

MONITORING AND CONTROL OF BUSINESS SEGMENT MARKET RISK



DEFINITION, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF

LIMITS



PERFORMANCE OF STRESS TESTING AND QUALITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS

IN ADDITION, THE FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE VALUATION CONTROL FUNCTIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK. THESE

GROUPS REPORT PRIMARILY INTO FINANCE.

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

MRM WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO IDENTIFY MARKET RISKS THROUGHOUT THE

FIRM AND TO REFINE AND MONITOR MARKET RISK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION OF MARKET RISKS WITHIN THEIR UNITS.

RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM TRADING PERSONNEL AND ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING RISK EXPOSURES THAT THE BUSINESS TAKES. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT FOR MARKET RISK ARISING FROM THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, MRM ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR IDENTIFYING EXPOSURES WHICH MAY NOT BE LARGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BUT WHICH MAY

BE LARGE FOR THE FIRM IN AGGREGATE. REGULAR MEETINGS ARE HELD BETWEEN MRM AND THE HEADS OF

RISK-TAKING BUSINESSES TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE ON RISK EXPOSURES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIENT FLOWS.

POSITIONS THAT EXPOSE THE FIRM TO MARKET RISK CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: TRADING AND

NONTRADING RISK. TRADING RISK INCLUDES POSITIONS THAT ARE HELD BY THE FIRM AS PART OF A BUSINESS

SEGMENT OR UNIT WHOSE MAIN BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO TRADE OR MAKE MARKETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES IN THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED IN TRADING REVENUE. NONTRADING RISK INCLUDES

SECURITIES HELD FOR LONGER TERM INVESTMENT, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, AND SECURITIES AND

DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE FIRMS ASSET/LIABILITY EXPOSURES. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN

THESE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT REPORTED IN TRADING REVENUE.

TRADING RISK

FIXED INCOME RISK (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK) INVOLVES THE POTENTIAL

DECLINE IN NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES, WHETHER

ARISING FROM CLIENT ACTIVITIES OR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES AND COMMODITIES RISKS INVOLVE THE POTENTIAL DECLINE IN NET INCOME TO THE

FIRM DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES OR COMMODITIES MARKETS, WHETHER ARISING

FROM CLIENT ACTIVITIES OR PROPRIETARY POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM.

NONTRADING RISK

NONTRADING RISK ARISES FROM EXECUTION OF THE FIRMS CORE BUSINESS STRATEGIES, THE DELIVERY OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS THE FIRM UNDERTAKES TO

RISK-MANAGE EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AMONG THE

MATURITY OR REPRICING OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OFFBALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL AND SHAPE OF MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES ALSO MAY CREATE INTEREST RATE RISK, SINCE THE

REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS DO NOT NECESSARILY MATCH THOSE OF ITS LIABILITIES.

THE FIRM ALSO IS EXPOSED TO BASIS RISK, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE IN RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF

TWO FLOATING RATE INDICES, SUCH AS THE PRIME RATE AND 3-MONTH LIBOR. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE

FIRMS PRODUCTS HAVE EMBEDDED OPTIONALITY THAT IMPACT PRICING AND BALANCES.

THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES ALSO GIVE RISE TO COMPLEX INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE INTEREST

RATE EXPOSURE FROM THE FIRMS MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES IS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF

INTEREST RATES, OPTION AND BASIS RISK. OPTION RISK ARISES PRIMARILY FROM PREPAYMENT OPTIONS

EMBEDDED IN MORTGAGES AND CHANGES IN THE PROBABILITY OF NEWLY-ORIGINATED MORTGAGE COMMITMENTS

ACTUALLY CLOSING. BASIS RISK RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT RELATIVE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN MORTGAGE RATES AND

OTHER INTEREST RATES.

RISK MEASUREMENT

TOOLS USED TO MEASURE RISK

BECAUSE NO SINGLE MEASURE CAN REFLECT ALL ASPECTS OF MARKET RISK, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS METRICS,

BOTH STATISTICAL AND NONSTATISTICAL, INCLUDING.



NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES



VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)



LOSS ADVISORIES



ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING



EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING



RISK IDENTIFICATION FOR LARGE EXPOSURES (RIFLE)

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES

NONSTATISTICAL RISK MEASURES OTHER THAN STRESS TESTING INCLUDE NET OPEN POSITIONS, BASIS POINT

VALUES, OPTION SENSITIVITIES, MARKET VALUES, POSITION CONCENTRATIONS AND POSITION TURNOVER. THESE

MEASURES PROVIDE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON THE FIRMS MARKET RISK EXPOSURE. THEY ARE AGGREGATED BY

LINE OF BUSINESS AND BY RISK TYPE, AND ARE USED FOR MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND

TACTICAL CONTROL.

VALUE-AT-RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES PRIMARY STATISTICAL RISK MEASURE, VAR, ESTIMATES THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ADVERSE

MARKET MOVES IN AN ORDINARY MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CROSS-BUSINESS MEASURE OF

RISK PROFILES AND LEVELS OF DIVERSIFICATION. VAR IS USED FOR COMPARING RISKS ACROSS BUSINESSES,

MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS, AND AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. VAR

PROVIDES RISK TRANSPARENCY IN A NORMAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT.

EACH BUSINESS DAY THE FIRM UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VAR CALCULATION THAT INCLUDES BOTH ITS

TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES. VAR FOR NONTRADING ACTIVITIES MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE EXPOSURES RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, VAR FOR SUCH

ACTIVITIES IS NOT A MEASURE OF REPORTED REVENUE SINCE NONTRADING ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY NOT

MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

75

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

TO CALCULATE VAR, THE FIRM USES HISTORICAL SIMULATION, WHICH MEASURES RISK ACROSS INSTRUMENTS

AND PORTFOLIOS IN A CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE WAY. THIS APPROACH ASSUMES THAT HISTORICAL CHANGES IN

MARKET VALUES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE CHANGES. THE SIMULATION IS BASED UPON DATA FOR THE

PREVIOUS TWELVE

MONTHS. THE FIRM CALCULATES VAR USING A ONE-DAY TIME HORIZON AND AN EXPECTED TAIL LOSS

METHODOLOGY, WHICH APPROXIMATES A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THE FIRM WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR

LOSSES GREATER THAN THAT PREDICTED BY VAR ESTIMATES ONLY ONCE IN EVERY 100 TRADING DAYS, OR ABOUT

2.5 TIMES A YEAR.

EXPOSURES USED TO MANAGE MSRS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND MSRS, SEE

PAGE 80 AND NOTE 15 ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, RESPECTIVELY. TRADING VAR INCLUDES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MARK-TO-MARKET TRADING ACTIVITIES IN THE IB, PLUS

(C)

AVERAGE AND PERIOD-END VARS ARE LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE VARS OF ITS MARKET RISK COMPONENTS,

WHICH IS DUE TO RISK OFFSETS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. THE DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT

REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE RISKS ARE NOT PERFECTLY CORRELATED. THE RISK OF A PORTFOLIO OF POSITIONS

IS THEREFORE USUALLY LESS THAN THE SUM OF THE RISKS OF THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES.

IBS

AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR DECREASED TO $88 MILLION DURING 2005 COMPARED WITH

$90 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2004. PERIOD-END VAR INCREASED OVER THE SAME PERIOD TO $108

MILLION FROM $78 MILLION. COMMODITIES AND OTHER VAR INCREASED DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF THE ENERGY

TRADING BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE TOTAL TRADING AND CREDIT PORTFOLIO VAR WAS DRIVEN BY

INCREASED PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION AS FIXED INCOME RISK DECREASED AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE, EQUITIES

AND COMMODITIES RISK INCREASED. TRADING VAR DIVERSIFICATION INCREASED TO $59 MILLION, OR 41% OF THE

SUM OF THE COMPONENTS, FROM $43 MILLION, OR 34% OF THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS. THE DIVERSIFICATION

EFFECT BETWEEN THE TRADING PORTFOLIO AND THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO ALSO INCREASED TO $12 MILLION, OR 12%

OF THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS, FROM $9 MILLION, OR 9% OF THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, OVER

THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, VAR EXPOSURES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS TRADING POSITIONS CHANGE, MARKET

VOLATILITY FLUCTUATES AND DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS CHANGE.

VAR BACKTESTING

TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS OF ITS VAR MODEL, THE FIRM CONDUCTS DAILY BACKTESTING OF VAR AGAINST

DAILY FINANCIAL RESULTS, BASED UPON MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE. MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUE IS

DEFINED AS THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET TRADING PORTFOLIOS PLUS ANY TRADING-RELATED

NET INTEREST INCOME, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING FEES OR OTHER REVENUE. THE FOLLOWING

HISTOGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE IB TRADING BUSINESSES

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE CHART SHOWS THAT THE IB POSTED MARKET RISK-RELATED GAINS

ON 208 OUT OF 260 DAYS IN THIS PERIOD, WITH 20 DAYS EXCEEDING $100 MILLION. THE INSET GRAPH LOOKS

AT THOSE DAYS ON WHICH THE IB EXPERIENCED LOSSES AND DEPICTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH VAR EXCEEDED THE

ACTUAL LOSS ON EACH OF THOSE DAYS. LOSSES WERE SUSTAINED ON 52 DAYS, WITH NO LOSS GREATER THAN $90

MILLION, AND WITH NO LOSS EXCEEDING THE VAR MEASURE.

LOSS ADVISORIES

LOSS ADVISORIES ARE TOOLS USED TO HIGHLIGHT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT TRADING LOSSES ABOVE CERTAIN

LEVELS AND ARE USED TO INITIATE DISCUSSION OF REMEDIES.

ECONOMIC VALUE STRESS TESTING

WHILE VAR REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS DUE TO UNLIKELY EVENTS IN NORMAL MARKETS, STRESS TESTING

CAPTURES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO UNLIKELY BUT PLAUSIBLE EVENTS IN ABNORMAL MARKETS. THE FIRM

CONDUCTS ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTS FOR BOTH ITS TRADING AND ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES USING

MULTIPLE SCENARIOS FOR BOTH TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. PERIODICALLY, SCENARIOS ARE REVIEWED AND UPDATED

TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE FIRMS RISK PROFILE AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. STRESS TESTING IS AS IMPORTANT

AS VAR IN MEASURING AND CONTROLLING RISK. STRESS TESTING ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRMS

RISK PROFILE AND LOSS POTENTIAL, AND IS USED FOR MONITORING LIMITS, ONE-OFF APPROVALS AND

CROSS-BUSINESS RISK MEASUREMENT, AS WELL AS AN INPUT TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION.

BASED UPON THE FIRMS STRESS SCENARIOS, THE STRESS TEST LOSS (PRE-TAX) IN THE IBS TRADING

PORTFOLIO RANGED FROM $469 MILLION TO $1.4 BILLION, AND $202 MILLION TO $1.2 BILLION, FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED

FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK STRESS TESTING

THE VAR AND STRESS-TEST MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ILLUSTRATE THE TOTAL ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY OF THE

FIRMS BALANCE SHEET TO CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON

REPORTED NET INCOME ALSO IS CRITICAL. INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE IN THE FIRMS CORE NONTRADING

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES (I.E., ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS) RESULTS FROM ON AND OFFBALANCE

SHEET POSITIONS. THE FIRM CONDUCTS SIMULATIONS OF CHANGES IN NII FROM ITS NONTRADING ACTIVITIES

UNDER A VARIETY OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SCENARIOS USED FOR

ECONOMIC-VALUE STRESS TESTING. EARNINGS-AT-RISK TESTS MEASURE THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FIRMS

NET INTEREST INCOME OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND HIGHLIGHT EXPOSURES TO VARIOUS RATE-SENSITIVE

FACTORS, SUCH AS THE RATES THEMSELVES (E.G., THE PRIME LENDING RATE), PRICING STRATEGIES ON

DEPOSITS, OPTIONALITY AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX. THE TESTS INCLUDE FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET

CHANGES, SUCH AS ASSET SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS, AS WELL AS PREPAYMENT AND REINVESTMENT BEHAVIOR.

EARNINGS-AT-RISK ALSO CAN RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE SLOPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, BECAUSE THE FIRM HAS

THE ABILITY TO LEND AT FIXED RATES AND BORROW AT VARIABLE OR SHORT-TERM FIXED RATES. BASED UPON

THESE SCENARIOS, THE FIRMS EARNINGS WOULD BE AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY A SUDDEN AND UNANTICIPATED

INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM RATES WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LONG-TERM RATES. CONVERSELY,

HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES GENERALLY ARE BENEFICIAL TO EARNINGS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INCREASE IS NOT

ACCOMPANIED BY RISING SHORT-TERM RATES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRESENT A LIMITED VIEW OF RISK, AND SO A NUMBER OF

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS ALSO ARE REVIEWED. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE THE IMPLIED FORWARD CURVE,

NONPARALLEL RATE SHIFTS AND SEVERE INTEREST RATE SHOCKS ON SELECTED KEY RATES. THESE SCENARIOS ARE

INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF JPMORGAN CHASES EARNINGS-AT-RISK OVER A WIDE RANGE OF

OUTCOMES.

THE FIRMS RISK TO RISING AND FALLING INTEREST RATES IS DUE PRIMARILY TO CORRESPONDING

INCREASES AND DECREASES IN SHORT-TERM FUNDING COSTS.

RIFLE

INDIVIDUALS WHO MANAGE RISK POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD ARISE FROM SPECIFIC UNUSUAL EVENTS, SUCH AS A POTENTIAL TAX

CHANGE, AND ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITIES OF LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH EVENTS. THIS INFORMATION IS

ENTERED INTO THE FIRMS RIFLE SYSTEM AND DIRECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT, THEREBY

PERMITTING THE FIRM TO IDENTIFY FURTHER EARNINGS VULNERABILITY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY STANDARD

RISK MEASURES.

RISK MONITORING AND CONTROL

LIMITS

MARKET RISK IS CONTROLLED PRIMARILY THROUGH A SERIES OF LIMITS. LIMITS REFLECT THE FIRMS RISK

APPETITE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN SETTING LIMITS, THE

FIRM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET VOLATILITY, PRODUCT LIQUIDITY, BUSINESS TRACK

RECORD AND MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE.

MRM REGULARLY REVIEWS AND UPDATES RISK LIMITS, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND APPROVES RISK

LIMITS AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. MRM FURTHER CONTROLS THE FIRMS EXPOSURE BY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATING

APPROVED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TENORS, KNOWN AS INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES, FOR EACH BUSINESS

SEGMENT.

THE FIRM MAINTAINS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LIMITS. CORPORATE-LEVEL LIMITS INCLUDE VAR, STRESS AND LOSS

ADVISORIES. SIMILARLY, LINE OF BUSINESS LIMITS INCLUDE VAR, STRESS AND LOSS ADVISORIES, AND ARE

SUPPLEMENTED BY NONSTATISTICAL MEASURE-

MENTS AND INSTRUMENT AUTHORITIES. BUSINESSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS,

AGAINST WHICH EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED. LIMIT BREACHES ARE REPORTED IN A TIMELY MANNER

TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND THE AFFECTED BUSINESS SEGMENT IS REQUIRED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO

REDUCE TRADING POSITIONS. IF THE BUSINESS CANNOT DO THIS WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIMEFRAME, SENIOR

MANAGEMENT IS CONSULTED ON THE APPROPRIATE ACTION.

QUALITATIVE REVIEW

MRM ALSO PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS AS NECESSARY OF BOTH BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS WITH EXPOSURE TO

MARKET RISK IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE BUSINESSES TO CONTROL THEIR MARKET RISK.

STRATEGIES, MARKET CONDITIONS, PRODUCT DETAILS AND RISK CONTROLS ARE REVIEWED, AND SPECIFIC

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO MANAGEMENT.

MODEL REVIEW

SOME OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CANNOT BE VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES BUT ARE

INSTEAD VALUED USING PRICING MODELS. SUCH MODELS ARE USED FOR MANAGEMENT OF RISK POSITIONS, SUCH AS

REPORTING AGAINST LIMITS, AS WELL AS FOR VALUATION. THE MODEL RISK GROUP, INDEPENDENT OF THE

BUSINESSES AND MRM, REVIEWS THE MODELS THE FIRM USES AND ASSESSES MODEL APPROPRIATENESS AND

CONSISTENCY. THE MODEL REVIEWS CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS ABOUT THE MODELS SUITABILITY FOR

VALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, INCLUDING WHETHER IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS, THE SUITABILITY

AND CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS, RELIABILITY OF DATA SOURCES, CONSISTENCY OF THE

TREATMENT WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS, AND SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT CANNOT BE PRICED FROM THE MARKET.

REVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED FOR NEW OR CHANGED MODELS, AS WELL AS PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED MODELS, TO ASSESS

WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET THAT MAY IMPACT THE MODELS VALIDITY

AND WHETHER THERE ARE THEORETICAL OR COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE REASSESSMENT OF THE

MODELS ADEQUACY. FOR A SUMMARY OF VALUATIONS BASED UPON MODELS, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

USED BY THE FIRM ON PAGES 8183 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK REPORTING

NONSTATISTICAL EXPOSURES, VALUE-AT-RISK, LOSS ADVISORIES AND LIMIT EXCESSES ARE REPORTED DAILY

FOR EACH TRADING AND NONTRADING BUSINESS. MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TRENDS, VALUE-AT-RISK TRENDS, PROFIT

AND LOSS CHANGES, AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATIONS ARE REPORTED WEEKLY. STRESS TEST RESULTS ARE

REPORTED MONTHLY TO BUSINESS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR SYSTEMS,

HUMAN FACTORS OR EXTERNAL EVENTS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATIONAL RISK IS INHERENT IN EACH OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. OPERATIONAL

RISK CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS, INCLUDING ERRORS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE

BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS THAT DO NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS.

THESE EVENTS CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING

REPUTATIONAL HARM.

TO MONITOR AND CONTROL OPERATIONAL RISK, THE FIRM MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES AND

A CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SOUND AND WELL-CONTROLLED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE

GOAL IS TO KEEP OPERATIONAL RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS, IN LIGHT OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, AND THE COMPETITIVE AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CONTROL MEASURES, THE FIRM

INCURS OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

THE FIRMS APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE SUCH LOSSES BY

SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL CONTROL-BASED APPROACHES TO OPERATIONAL RISK WITH RISK MEASURES, TOOLS

AND DISCIPLINES THAT ARE RISK-SPECIFIC, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND UTILIZED FIRMWIDE. KEY THEMES ARE

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION, ESCALATION OF KEY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ISSUE RESOLUTION.

DURING 2005, THE FIRM SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PHOENIX, A NEW

INTERNALLY-DESIGNED OPERATIONAL RISK SOFTWARE TOOL. PHOENIX INTEGRATES THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF

THE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INTO A UNIFIED, WEB-BASED TOOL. PHOENIX IS INTENDED TO

ENABLE THE FIRM TO ENHANCE ITS REPORTING AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL RISK DATA BY ENABLING RISK

IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS TO BE DONE IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER,

THEREBY ENABLING EFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONAL RISK.

FOR PURPOSES OF IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING, REPORTING AND ANALYSIS, THE FIRM CATEGORIZES

OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS AS FOLLOWS.



CLIENT SERVICE AND SELECTION



BUSINESS PRACTICES



FRAUD, THEFT AND MALICE



EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT



EMPLOYEE DISPUTES



DISASTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY



TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

RISK IDENTIFICATION IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY

GIVE RISE TO OPERATIONAL LOSSES.

IN 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED A MULTI-YEAR EFFORT TO REDESIGN THE UNDERLYING

ARCHITECTURE OF ITS FIRMWIDE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE GOAL OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS

FOR EACH BUSINESS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS SPECIFIC TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ASSESS THE

DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAINTAINS APPROPRIATE CONTROLS. ACTION PLANS ARE DEVELOPED FOR CONTROL ISSUES

IDENTIFIED, AND BUSINESSES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR TRACKING AND RESOLVING THESE ISSUES ON A TIMELY

BASIS.

ALL BUSINESSES WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN 2005. GOING FORWARD, THE FIRM WILL

UTILIZE THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS A DYNAMIC RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL.

RISK MONITORING

THE FIRM HAS A PROCESS FOR MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISK-EVENT DATA, PERMITTING ANALYSIS OF ERRORS

AND LOSSES AS WELL AS TRENDS. SUCH ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BOTH AT A LINE OF BUSINESS LEVEL AND BY

RISK-EVENT TYPE, ENABLES IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES ASSOCIATED WITH RISK EVENTS FACED BY THE

BUSINESSES. WHERE AVAILABLE, THE INTERNAL DATA CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA FOR

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH INDUSTRY PATTERNS. THE DATA REPORTED WILL ENABLE THE FIRM TO BACK-TEST

AGAINST SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS.

RISK REPORTING AND ANALYSIS

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION

ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATIONAL LOSS LEVELS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT RESULTS, TO THE LINES OF BUSINESS AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE REPORTS IS TO ENABLE MANAGEMENT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONAL

RISK AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, TO ESCALATE ISSUES AND TO PROVIDE

CONSISTENT DATA AGGREGATION ACROSS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT AREAS.

AUDIT ALIGNMENT

INTERNAL AUDIT UTILIZES A RISK-BASED PROGRAM OF AUDIT COVERAGE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE DESIGN AND EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS OVER THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

AND REPORTING. AUDIT PARTNERS WITH BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE CONTROL COMMUNITY IN

PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THE OPERATIONAL RISK FRAMEWORK AND REVIEWING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND ACCURACY

OF THE BUSINESS SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS UNIT AUDITS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

A FIRMS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY, CREDIT, MARKET AND

OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT ARE PART OF ITS BUSINESS RISKS, BUT EQUALLY ON THE MAINTENANCE AMONG MANY

CONSTITUENTS  CLIENTS, INVESTORS, REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC  OF A REPUTATION

FOR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. ATTENTION TO REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KEY ASPECT

OF THE FIRMS PRACTICES, AND MAINTENANCE OF REPUTATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE AT THE

FIRM. JPMORGAN CHASE BOLSTERS THIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE

FIRMS CODE OF CONDUCT, TRAINING, MAINTAINING ADHERENCE TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT APPROVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE A CONFLICTS

OFFICE, WHICH EXAMINES WHOLESALE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

FOR THE FIRM.

POLICY REVIEW OFFICE

THE FIRM ALSO HAS A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE TO ADDRESS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH CLIENTS, ESPECIALLY

COMPLEX DERIVATIVES AND STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS, THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY

AFFECT ITS REPUTATION. THIS STRUCTURE REINFORCES THE FIRMS PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING TRANSACTIONS

IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATENESS, ETHICAL ISSUES AND REPUTATIONAL RISK, AND IT INTENSIFIES THE FIRMS

SCRUTINY OF THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF ITS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE CLIENTS POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE

GOAL THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT USED TO MISLEAD INVESTORS OR OTHERS. THE STRUCTURE OPERATES AT

THREE LEVELS: AS PART OF EVERY BUSINESS TRANSACTION APPROVAL PROCESS; THROUGH REVIEW BY REGIONAL

REPUTATION RISK COMMITTEES; AND THROUGH OVERSIGHT BY THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS REPUTATION

RISK LIES WITH THE BUSINESS UNITS CONDUCTING THE TRANSACTIONS IN QUESTION. THE FIRMS TRANSACTION

APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES REVIEW FROM, AMONG OTHERS, INTERNAL LEGAL/COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS, TAX AND

ACCOUNTING GROUPS. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING AN SPE ESTABLISHED BY THE FIRM RECEIVE PARTICULAR

SCRUTINY INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SUCH ENTITY IS PROPERLY APPROVED, DOCUMENTED, MONITORED AND

CONTROLLED.

BUSINESS UNITS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO REGIONAL REPUTATION RISK

COMMITTEES PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO HEIGHTENED REPUTATION RISK  PARTICULARLY A

CLIENTS MOTIVATION AND ITS INTENDED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OF THE TRANSACTION. THE COMMITTEES MAY

APPROVE, REJECT OR REQUIRE FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON OR CHANGES TO THE TRANSACTIONS. THE MEMBERS OF

THESE COMMITTEES ARE SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS AND SUPPORT UNITS IN THE REGION. THE

COMMITTEES MAY ESCALATE TRANSACTION REVIEW TO THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE IS THE MOST SENIOR APPROVAL LEVEL FOR CLIENT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

REPUTATION RISK ISSUES. THE MANDATE OF THE OFFICE IS TO OPINE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS BROUGHT BY

THE REGIONAL COMMITTEES AND CONSIDER CHANGES IN POLICIES OR PRACTICES RELATING TO REPUTATION RISK.

THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE CONSULTS WITH THE FIRMS MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AND

PROVIDES REGULAR UPDATES. ASIDE FROM GOVERNANCE AND GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, THE

OBJECTIVE OF THE POLICY REVIEW PROCESS IS TO REINFORCE A CULTURE, THROUGH A CASE STUDY APPROACH,

THAT ENSURES THAT ALL EMPLOYEES, REGARDLESS OF SENIORITY, UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF

REPUTATION RISK CONTROL AND CAN RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE.

IN 2006, THIS STRUCTURE, WHICH UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON INVESTMENT BANK ACTIVITIES,

WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE ACTIVITIES OF COMMERCIAL BANKING AND THE PRIVATE BANK. THESE LINES

OF BUSINESS WILL IMPLEMENT TRAINING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE INVESTMENT BANK

AND THEIR ACTIVITIES ALSO WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE POLICY REVIEW OFFICE.

FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS INCLUDE IN THEIR MANDATE THE OVERSIGHT

OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, FIDUCIARY RISKS IN THEIR BUSINESSES THAT MAY

PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WORKS

WITH THE RELEVANT LINE OF BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES PROVIDING INVESTMENT

OR RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT GIVE RISE TO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO CLIENTS PERFORM AT

THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD RELATIVE TO THEIR FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLIENT. OF PARTICULAR

FOCUS ARE THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ADDRESS A BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITIES TO A CLIENT,

INCLUDING CLIENT SUITABILITY DETERMINATION, DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, DISCLOSURE COMMUNICATIONS AND

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH OF THE INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY THE FIRM THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH FIDUCIARY DUTIES. IN THIS WAY, THE

RELEVANT LINE-OF-BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES, TOGETHER WITH THE FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION,

PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND CONTROL THE RISKS THAT MAY ARISE IN

THE DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO CLIENTS THAT GIVE RISE TO SUCH DUTIES, AS WELL AS

THOSE STEMMING FROM ANY OF THE FIRMS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE FIRMS

VARIOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE FIRM MAKES DIRECT PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY. THE ILLIQUID NATURE AND LONG-TERM

HOLDING PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS DIFFERENTIATES PRIVATE EQUITY RISK FROM THE RISK

OF POSITIONS HELD IN THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS. THE FIRMS APPROACH TO MANAGING PRIVATE EQUITY RISK IS

CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRMS GENERAL RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE ESTABLISHING

TARGET LEVELS FOR TOTAL AND ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE

PORTFOLIO. INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION LIMITS ARE IN PLACE

INTENDED TO ENSURE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, AND PERIODIC REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON THE

PORTFOLIO TO SUBSTANTIATE THE VALUATIONS OF THE INVESTMENTS. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE

FINANCE AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY

PORTFOLIOS OF JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND ONE EQUITY PARTNERS BUSINESSES WAS $6.2 BILLION, OF WHICH $479

MILLION REPRESENTED POSITIONS TRADED IN THE PUBLIC MARKET.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMORGAN CHASES ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS

REPORTED RESULTS. THE FIRMS MOST COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT TO

ASCERTAIN THE VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED DETAILED POLICIES AND

CONTROL PROCEDURES INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT VALUATION METHODS, INCLUDING ANY JUDGMENTS MADE AS PART

OF SUCH METHODS, ARE WELL CONTROLLED, INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED CONSISTENTLY FROM PERIOD

TO PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS FOR

CHANGING METHODOLOGIES OCCURS IN A CONTROLLED AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. THE FIRM BELIEVES ITS

ESTIMATES FOR DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROPRIATE. THE

FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRMS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT

VALUATION JUDGMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS AS

WELL AS THE FIRMS PORTFOLIO OF WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

LOSSES IS INTENDED TO ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE FIRMS LOAN ASSETS FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES AS OF

THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING THE

FIRMS ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 107108 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

WHOLESALE LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING BOTH THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT INVOLVES THE

EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF CREDITS THAT ARE DETERIORATING. SECOND, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO

DERIVE LOSS FACTORS. THIRD, IT INVOLVES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO EVALUATE CERTAIN MACROECONOMIC

FACTORS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND TO REFINE LOSS FACTORS TO BETTER REFLECT THESE

CONDITIONS.

THE FIRM USES A RISK RATING SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ITS WHOLESALE LOANS.

WHOLESALE LOANS ARE REVIEWED FOR INFORMATION AFFECTING THE OBLIGORS ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS

OBLIGATIONS. IN ASSESSING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN, AMONG THE FACTORS CONSIDERED

INCLUDE THE OBLIGORS DEBT CAPACITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, THE LEVEL OF THE OBLIGORS EARNINGS,

THE AMOUNT AND SOURCES FOR REPAYMENT, THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF CONTINGENCIES, MANAGEMENT STRENGTH,

AND THE INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHY IN WHICH THE OBLIGOR OPERATES. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED UPON AN

EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT INFORMATION, AND INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND

INTERPRETATION. EMPHASIZING ONE FACTOR OVER ANOTHER, OR CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY BE

RELEVANT IN DETERMINING THE RISK RATING OF A PARTICULAR LOAN BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY AN

EXPLICIT PART OF THE FIRMS METHODOLOGY, COULD IMPACT THE RISK RATING ASSIGNED BY THE FIRM TO THAT

LOAN.

MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CREDIT FACILITY. THESE

LOSS FACTORS ARE DETERMINED BY FACILITY STRUCTURE, COLLATERAL AND TYPE OF OBLIGOR. WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, THE FIRM USES INDEPENDENT, VERIFIABLE DATA OR THE FIRMS OWN HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE

IN ITS MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THESE LOSS FACTORS. MANY FACTORS CAN AFFECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF

LOSS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT, PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND RATING MIGRATIONS.

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT SHOULD BE CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE

OVER THE ENTIRE CREDIT CYCLE OR AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE CREDIT CYCLE. THE APPLICATION OF

DIFFERENT LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT FACTORS WOULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE FIRM. SIMILARLY, THERE ARE JUDGMENTS AS TO WHICH EXTERNAL

DATA ON PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE USED. CHOOSING DATA THAT ARE

NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE FIRMS SPECIFIC LOAN PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS COULD ALSO AFFECT LOSS

ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT

ALSO APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT TO ADJUST THE LOSS FACTORS DERIVED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE NOT YET

REFLECTED IN THE LOSS FACTORS. THE RESULTANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ON THE

PERFORMING PORTFOLIO ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED RANGES USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF

BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED AND

DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED WHERE RELEVANT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO. THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE WHOLESALE

LOAN PORTFOLIO FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS $621 MILLION, THE HIGHER-END WITHIN THE

RANGE, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CONSUMER LOANS

FOR SCORED LOANS IN THE CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS, LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING

STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. THESE LOSS

ESTIMATES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY STATUS, CREDIT BUREAU SCORES, THE REALIZABLE

VALUE OF COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING THE HISTORICAL

LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. MANAGEMENT ANALYZES THE RANGE OF CREDIT LOSS

EXPERIENCED FOR EACH MAJOR PORTFOLIO SEGMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIC CYCLES, PORTFOLIO

SEASONING AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, AND THEN FORMULATES A RANGE THAT INCORPORATES RELEVANT RISK

FACTORS THAT IMPACT OVERALL CREDIT PERFORMANCE. THE RECORDED ADJUSTMENT TO THE STATISTICAL

CALCULATION FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS $1.2 BILLION, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A PORTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING TRADING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AFS SECURITIES AND PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS,

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS) AND COMMODITIES INVENTORY ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF FAIR VALUE

OR COST. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $386 BILLION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS WERE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES

OR ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT UTILIZE INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING

INTEREST RATE YIELD CURVES, OPTION VOLATILITIES AND CURRENCY RATES.

THE DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. FOR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRADED AND HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PARAMETERS READILY

AVAILABLE, THERE IS LITTLE-TO-NO SUBJECTIVITY IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES AND PARAMETERS DO NOT EXIST, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE

VALUATION PROCESS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

FACTORS SUCH AS LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND, FOR THE DERIVATIVES PORTFOLIO,

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK (SEE THE DISCUSSION OF CVA ON PAGE 70 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT). FOR EXAMPLE,

THERE IS OFTEN LIMITED MARKET DATA TO RELY ON WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF A LARGE OR AGED

POSITION. SIMILARLY, JUDGMENT MUST BE APPLIED IN ESTIMATING PRICES FOR LESS READILY OBSERVABLE

EXTERNAL PARAMETERS. FINALLY, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, MARKET DISLOCATIONS AND

UNEXPECTED CORRELATIONS CAN AFFECT ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. IMPRECISION IN ESTIMATING THESE FACTORS

CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE OR LOSS RECORDED FOR A PARTICULAR POSITION.

TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITIES HELD FOR TRADING AND INVESTMENT PURPOSES (LONG

POSITIONS) AND SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS SOLD TO OTHER PARTIES BUT DOES NOT OWN (SHORT

POSITIONS) ARE VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SECURITIES ARE LESS ACTIVELY

TRADED AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO BE VALUED BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE

DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AS THIS DETERMINATION MAY REQUIRE

BENCHMARKING TO SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR ANALYZING DEFAULT AND RECOVERY RATES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE

CERTAIN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND HIGH-YIELD DEBT SECURITIES.

AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE, THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT ARE ACTIVELY QUOTED AND CAN BE VALIDATED TO EXTERNAL

SOURCES, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-PRICING SERVICES. CERTAIN DERIVATIVES, HOWEVER, ARE VALUED BASED UPON

MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS  THAT IS, PARAMETERS THAT MUST BE

ESTIMATED AND ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO SUBSTANTIATE THE MODEL VALUATION.

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NORMALLY EITHER LESS ACTIVELY TRADED OR TRADE ACTIVITY IS ONE-WAY. EXAMPLES

INCLUDE LONG-DATED INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY SWAPS, WHERE SWAP RATES MAY BE UNOBSERVABLE FOR LONGER

MATURITIES, AND CERTAIN CREDIT PRODUCTS, WHERE CORRELATION AND RECOVERY RATES ARE UNOBSERVABLE. DUE

TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THE FIRM DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED IN TRADING REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS

AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE. MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT ALSO INCLUDES RECORDING

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (I.E., REDUCTIONS) TO MODEL VALUATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY

WHEN VALUING COMPLEX OR LESS ACTIVELY TRADED DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

SUMMARIZES THE FIRMS TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIOS BY VALUATION METHODOLOGY AT

POSITIONS PURSUANT TO FIN 39, AS CROSS-PRODUCT NETTING IS NOT RELEVANT TO AN ANALYSIS BASED UPON

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES.

TO ENSURE THAT THE VALUATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE FIRM HAS VARIOUS CONTROLS IN PLACE. THESE

INCLUDE: AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF VALUATION MODELS; DETAILED REVIEW AND EXPLANATION

FOR PROFIT AND LOSS ANALYZED DAILY AND OVER TIME; DECOMPOSING THE MODEL VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN

STRUCTURED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS INTO THEIR COMPONENTS AND BENCHMARKING VALUATIONS, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND VALIDATING VALUATION ESTIMATES THROUGH ACTUAL CASH SETTLEMENT.

AS MARKETS AND PRODUCTS DEVELOP AND THE PRICING

FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS BECOMES MORE TRANSPARENT, THE FIRM REFINES ITS VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA, A GROUP INDEPENDENT OF THE

RISK-TAKING FUNCTION, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE VALUATIONS OF POSITIONS

TAKEN WITHIN THE INVESTMENT BANK.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE MODEL REVIEW PROCESS, SEE MARKET RISK

MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 7578 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE FIRMS

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, SEE NOTE 29 ON PAGES 126128 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE

THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO IS GENERALLY BASED UPON OBSERVABLE MARKET

PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK THAT IS DISCOUNTED USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT

INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

COMMODITIES INVENTORY

THE MAJORITY OF COMMODITIES INVENTORY INCLUDES BULLION AND BASE METALS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO PRICES IN HIGHLY ACTIVE AND LIQUID MARKETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING PRICES AND DATA DERIVED FROM LESS LIQUID AND

DEVELOPING MARKETS WHERE THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE TRADED.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

VALUATION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES, INHERENT LACK

OF LIQUIDITY AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF SUCH ASSETS. PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED

BASED UPON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN

ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY PRIVATE EQUITYS SENIOR

INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT, INDUSTRY VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK

AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ENVIRONMENT OVER TIME. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE

AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD

BY PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS

MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS FROM SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES DO NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE,

OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, BUT THE PRECISE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE TYPICALLY NOT READILY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE OF MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS USING DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH

FLOW (DCF) MODELS.

FOR MSRS, THE MODEL CONSIDERS PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES AND

PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS, DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES, COSTS TO SERVICE

AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY BEGAN UTILIZING AN

OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION APPROACH WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THIS

APPROACH, WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODEL, PROJECTS MSR CASH

FLOWS OVER MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, WHICH ARE THEN DISCOUNTED AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES, TO

ESTIMATE AN EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE OAS VALUATION APPROACH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE

IMPROVED ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. THE INITIAL VALUATION OF MSRS UNDER OAS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS (SUCH AS INTEREST ONLY STRIPS), A SINGLE

INTEREST RATE PATH DCF MODEL IS USED AND GENERALLY INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON PROJECTED

FINANCE CHARGES RELATED TO THE SECURITIZED ASSETS, ESTIMATED NET CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT

ASSUMPTIONS, AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAID TO THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS

USED MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS VALUATION OF RETAINED INTERESTS.

FOR BOTH MSRS AND CERTAIN OTHER RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZATIONS, THE FIRM COMPARES ITS FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE AND TO RECENT MARKET

ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE

FAIR VALUES ARE SUPPORTABLE AND REASONABLE.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE RETAINED INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZATIONS AND MSRS, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE STRESS TESTS FOR THOSE ASSUMPTIONS, SEE NOTES

13 AND 15 ON PAGES 108111 AND 114116, RESPECTIVELY, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER SFAS 142, GOODWILL MUST BE ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS AND TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE FIRM

TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH

AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING

AN INTERIM TEST. IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING-UNIT LEVEL (WHICH IS GENERALLY

ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE 31 ON PAGES 130131 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT, PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY WHICH IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). THE FIRST PART OF THE TEST IS A

COMPARISON, AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, THEN THE SECOND PART

OF THE TEST IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE IMPLIED FAIR

VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL IS CALCULATED AND COMPARED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL

RECORDED IN THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RECORDS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL EXCEEDS

THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL, THEN THE FIRM WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE

AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE, WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE AGAINST NET INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS BASED UPON

EACH REPORTING UNITS INTERNAL FORECASTS. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS USING MARKET-BASED TRADING AND

TRANSACTION MULTIPLES, WHERE AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE VALUATIONS

DERIVED FROM THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS.

GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 OR 2004, NOR WAS ANY GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF DUE TO

IMPAIRMENT DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003. SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGE 114 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE NATURE AND ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND THE

CARRYING VALUES OF GOODWILL BY MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENT.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT OF 2004

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE

ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS AT

A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY PROVIDING A DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON THE

REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION PROVISION). THE

NEW DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE FIRM APPLIED THE REPATRIATION PROVISION TO $1.9 BILLION OF CASH

FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS, RESULTING IN A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $55 MILLION. THE $1.9 BILLION OF CASH WILL

BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN PURSUANT TO THE GUIDELINES SET

FORTH IN THE ACT.

ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 123R, WHICH REVISES SFAS 123 AND SUPERSEDES APB 25. IN MARCH

2005, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED SAB 107 WHICH PROVIDES INTERPRETIVE

GUIDANCE ON SFAS 123R. ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING UNDER SFAS 123R IS GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THE SFAS

123 APPROACH. HOWEVER, SFAS 123R REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO

EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT

BASED UPON THEIR FAIR VALUES. PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE IS NO LONGER AN ALTERNATIVE. SFAS 123R PERMITS

ADOPTION USING ONE OF TWO METHODS  MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE. IN APRIL 2005, THE SEC APPROVED A NEW RULE THAT,

FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES, DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 123R TO NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2006. THE

FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006, UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD.

THE FIRM CONTINUED TO ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002, UNDER APB 25 USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. THEREFORE, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR SOME

PREVIOUSLY GRANTED AWARDS THAT WAS NOT RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS 123 WILL BE RECOGNIZED COMMENCING

JANUARY 1, 2006, UNDER SFAS 123R. HAD THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 123R IN PRIOR PERIODS, THE IMPACT WOULD

HAVE APPROXIMATED THAT SHOWN IN THE SFAS 123 PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 7 ON PAGES 100102 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH PRESENTS NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF ALL OUTSTANDING AWARDS

WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE.

PRIOR TO ADOPTING SFAS 123R, THE FIRMS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WAS TO RECOGNIZE

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

83

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS STATED SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN JANUARY 2006, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SFAS 123R, THE FIRM WILL

RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON THE GRANT DATE WITHOUT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACT OF POST-EMPLOYMENT

RESTRICTIONS. THIS WILL RESULT IN

AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED

MARCH 31, 2006 OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, AS COMPARED

WITH THE EXPENSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED UNDER THE

FIRMS PRIOR ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE FIRM WILL ALSO ACCRUE IN 2006 THE ESTIMATED COST OF STOCK AWARDS TO BE GRANTED TO RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN JANUARY 2007.

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

IN MARCH 2005, FASB ISSUED FIN 47 TO CLARIFY THE TERM CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION AS

USED IN SFAS 143. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO PERFORM AN

ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IN WHICH THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT ARE CONDITIONAL BASED

UPON A FUTURE EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION TO

PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ABOUT THE

TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT. FIN 47 CLARIFIES THAT A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A

LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IF THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING WHEN A COMPANY

WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION. THE FIRM ADOPTED FIN 47 ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE IMPLEMENTATION

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 133 AND 140

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 155, WHICH APPLIES TO CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. THE NEW STANDARD ESTABLISHES

A REQUIREMENT TO EVALUATE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF THE

INTERESTS REPRESENT FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES OR ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REQUIRING BIFURCATION.

THIS NEW STANDARD ALSO PERMITS AN ELECTION FOR FAIR VALUE REMEASUREMENT OF ANY HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT CONTAINING AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD REQUIRE BIFURCATION UNDER SFAS

133. THE FAIR VALUE ELECTION CAN BE APPLIED ON AN INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS TO EXISTING

INSTRUMENTS AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION AND CAN BE APPLIED TO NEW INSTRUMENTS ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

CURRENTLY, THE FIRM IS PLANNING TO ADOPT THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. IN ADDITION, THE

FIRM IS ASSESSING TO WHICH QUALIFYING EXISTING AND NEWLY ISSUED INSTRUMENTS IT WILL APPLY THE FAIR

VALUE ELECTION. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, JPMORGAN CHASE TRADES NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS, THE FIRM USES VARIOUS FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON INTERNAL MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE

MARKET PARAMETERS. THE FIRMS NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY

ENERGY-RELATED CONTRACTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

MANAGEMENT OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS

DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE, PRINCIPAL OPERATING AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY JPMORGAN

CHASES BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PERSONNEL, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS, THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE FIRMS ASSETS; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

FIRM ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE FIRMS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT USED THE

FRAMEWORK IN INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE COSO CRITERIA.

BASED UPON THE ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, JPMORGAN

CHASES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE COSO CRITERIA.

ADDITIONALLY, BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, THE FIRM

DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, JPMORGAN CHASES

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHO ALSO AUDITED THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS

OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO..

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S 2005 AND 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AN

AUDIT OF ITS 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S 2005,

2004, AND 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE

COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL

 INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED

BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (JPMORGAN CHASE OR THE FIRM), A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED

UNDER DELAWARE LAW IN 1968, IS A LEADING GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THE FIRM IS A LEADER IN

INVESTMENT BANKING, FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, FINANCIAL TRANSACTION

PROCESSING, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, PRIVATE BANKING AND PRIVATE EQUITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

FIRMS BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 31 ON PAGES 130131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONFORM TO

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP) AND

PREVAILING INDUSTRY PRACTICES. ADDITIONALLY, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE POLICIES CONFORM TO THE

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY BANK REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNTS OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE FIRM HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

THE USUAL CONDITION FOR A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IS OWNERSHIP OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING

INTERESTS OF AN ENTITY. HOWEVER, A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST MAY ALSO EXIST IN ENTITIES, SUCH

AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE CONTROLLING VOTING

INTERESTS.

SPES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, PROVIDING MARKET LIQUIDITY BY FACILITATING

INVESTORS ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND RISKS. THEY ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CRITICAL TO

THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS. SPES MAY

BE ORGANIZED AS TRUSTS, PARTNERSHIPS OR CORPORATIONS AND ARE TYPICALLY SET UP FOR A SINGLE,

DISCRETE PURPOSE. SPES ARE NOT TYPICALLY OPERATING ENTITIES AND USUALLY HAVE A LIMITED LIFE AND NO

EMPLOYEES. THE BASIC SPE STRUCTURE INVOLVES A COMPANY SELLING ASSETS TO THE SPE. THE SPE FUNDS THE

PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS BY ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT GOVERN THE

TRANSACTION DESCRIBE HOW THE CASH EARNED ON THE ASSETS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO THE SPES INVESTORS AND

OTHER PARTIES THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO THOSE CASH FLOWS. SPES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO BE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE,

THEREBY INSULATING INVESTORS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE CREDITORS OF OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE

SELLER OF THE ASSETS.

THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORKS APPLICABLE TO SPES: THE QUALIFYING SPE (QSPE)

FRAMEWORK UNDER SFAS 140; AND THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) FRAMEWORK UNDER FIN 46R. THE

APPLICABLE FRAMEWORK DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY AND THE FIRMS RELATION TO THAT ENTITY.

THE QSPE FRAMEWORK IS APPLICABLE WHEN AN ENTITY TRANSFERS (SELLS) FINANCIAL ASSETS TO AN SPE

MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA DEFINED IN SFAS 140. THESE CRITERIA ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY ARE ESSENTIALLY PREDETERMINED

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSFEROR OF THE FINANCIAL ASSETS CANNOT EXERCISE

CONTROL OVER THE ENTITY AND THE ASSETS THEREIN. ENTITIES MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT

CONSOLIDATED BY THE TRANSFEROR OR OTHER COUNTERPARTIES, AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL

ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OR TO CAUSE THE ENTITY TO NO LONGER MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA. THE FIRM PRIMARILY

FOLLOWS THE QSPE MODEL FOR SECURITIZATIONS OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD

LOANS AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

WHEN THE SPE DOES NOT MEET THE QSPE CRITERIA, CONSOLIDATION IS ASSESSED PURSUANT TO FIN 46R. UNDER

FIN 46R, A VIE IS DEFINED AS AN ENTITY THAT: (1) LACKS ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK TO PERMIT

THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

PARTIES; (2) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT LACK THE RIGHT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING THE

ENTITYS OPERATIONS; AND/OR (3) HAS EQUITY OWNERS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ABSORB OR THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE ENTITYS LOSSES OR RETURNS.

FIN 46R REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER (I.E., A COUNTERPARTY TO A VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE

IF THAT PARTY WILL ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIE, RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, OR BOTH. THIS PARTY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN

MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, THE FIRM THOROUGHLY EVALUATES THE VIES DESIGN, CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. WHEN THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED

THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, THE FIRM PERFORMS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPUTES AND

ALLOCATES EXPECTED LOSSES OR RESIDUAL RETURNS TO VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS. THE ALLOCATION OF

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED UPON THE RELATIVE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES

OF EACH INTEREST HOLDER IN THE VIES CAPITAL STRUCTURE. FOR FURTHER DETAILS, SEE NOTE 14 ON PAGES

111113 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ALL RETAINED INTERESTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE FIRM, QSPES AND NONCONSOLIDATED

VIES ARE REFLECTED ON JPMORGAN CHASES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE VOTING-INTEREST ENTITIES UNDER FIN 46R IN WHICH

THE FIRM HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OPERATING AND FINANCING DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN OTHER

ASSETS, AND THE FIRMS SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 9 ON PAGES 103105 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

ASSETS HELD FOR CLIENTS IN AN AGENCY OR FIDUCIARY CAPACITY BY THE FIRM ARE NOT ASSETS OF JPMORGAN

CHASE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, EXPENSES AND

DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

BANK ONE WAS CONVERTED IN A STOCK-FOR-STOCK EXCHANGE INTO 1.32 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. JPMORGAN CHASE STOCKHOLDERS KEPT THEIR SHARES, WHICH REMAINED OUTSTANDING AND UNCHANGED AS

SHARES OF JPMORGAN CHASE FOLLOWING THE MERGER. KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE MERGER WERE TO PROVIDE THE

FIRM WITH A MORE BALANCED BUSINESS MIX AND GREATER GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. THE MERGER WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF BANK ONE BE FAIR VALUED AS OF JULY 1, 2004. THE PURCHASE PRICE TO COMPLETE THE

MERGER WAS $58.5 BILLION.

AS PART OF THE MERGER, CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES WERE CONFORMED, WHICH RESULTED IN

$976 MILLION OF CHARGES IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE CONFORMITY CHARGES COMPRISED A

$1.4 BILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE DECERTIFICATION OF THE SELLERS INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD

SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE BENEFIT OF A $584 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AS

A RESULT OF CONFORMING THE WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER CREDIT PROVISION METHODOLOGIES.

THE FINAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE MERGER HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED USING THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THE MERGER DATE. THE COMPUTATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE AND

THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE NET ASSETS OF BANK ONE  BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 6  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

NEW U.S.-BASED POSTRETIREMENT PLANS WERE INTRODUCED IN 2005 AFTER THE BANK ONE PLANS WERE

MERGED INTO THE HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 87 AND SFAS 88.

THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 106.

THE FIRM USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31 FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS. IN ADDITION, AS OF AUGUST 1, 2005, THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE

INSURANCE PLAN WAS REMEASURED TO REFLECT A MID-YEAR PLAN AMENDMENT AND THE FINAL MEDICARE PART D

REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED ON JANUARY 21, 2005. FOR THE FIRMS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN

ASSETS, FAIR VALUE IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE FIRMS

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS. UNRECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE

PERIOD OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY 10 YEARS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

PLANS, UNRECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ALSO AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD,

WHICH IS CURRENTLY 8 YEARS. HOWEVER, PRIOR SERVICE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE AVERAGE YEARS OF SERVICE REMAINING TO FULL

ELIGIBILITY AGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY 6 YEARS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

THE FIRM HAS A QUALIFIED NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE U.S. PLAN EMPLOYS A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, IN THE FORM OF

SALARY AND INTEREST CREDITS, TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED AT RETIREMENT, BASED UPON

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO ACCRUE PLAN BENEFITS AFTER

COMPLETING ONE YEAR OF SERVICE, AND BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE FIRM

ALSO OFFERS BENEFITS THROUGH DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO QUALIFYING EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. LOCATIONS BASED UPON ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND YEARS OF SERVICE.

IT IS THE FIRMS POLICY TO FUND THE PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

UNDER APPLICABLE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND LOCAL TAX LAWS. THE FIRM DID NOT MAKE ANY U.S. PENSION PLAN

CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2005 AND BASED UPON THE CURRENT FUNDED STATUS OF THIS PLAN, THE FIRM DOES NOT

EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2006. IN 2004, THE FIRM MADE A CASH CONTRIBUTION TO ITS

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN OF $1.1 BILLION, FUNDING THE PLAN TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNT

UNDER APPLICABLE TAX LAW. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRM MADE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $78 MILLION AND

$40 MILLION TO FULLY FUND THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN RETIREES AND

QUALIFYING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS VARY WITH LENGTH OF SERVICE AND DATE OF HIRE AND PROVIDE

FOR LIMITS ON THE FIRMS SHARE OF COVERED MEDICAL BENEFITS. THE MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE CONTRIBUTORY,

WHILE THE LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY. AS OF AUGUST 1, 2005, THE ELIGIBILITY

REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES TO QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE WERE REVISED AND

LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE WAS ELIMINATED FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES RETIRING AFTER 2005. POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFITS ALSO ARE OFFERED TO QUALIFYING U.K. EMPLOYEES.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

ACT) WAS ENACTED. THE ACT ESTABLISHED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE (MEDICARE PART

D) AND A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT

THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D. THE FIRM HAS DETERMINED THAT BENEFITS

PROVIDED TO CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS ARE AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D AND HAS

REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF THE SUBSIDY IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES RETROACTIVE TO THE

BEGINNING OF 2004 (JULY 1, 2004 FOR BANK ONE PLANS) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FSP SFAS 106-2.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION IS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH CORPORATE-OWNED

LIFE INSURANCE (COLI) PURCHASED ON THE LIVES OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. WHILE THE FIRM

OWNS THE COLI POLICIES, COLI PROCEEDS (DEATH BENEFITS, WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS) MAY BE

USED ONLY TO REIMBURSE THE FIRM FOR NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RELATED

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE U.K. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

FOR PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, THE UNRECOGNIZED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DECLINES

IN INTEREST RATES IN RECENT YEARS, AS OFFSET BY RECENT ASSET GAINS AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED THROUGH

AMORTIZATION IN EXPENSE. OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNT INCLUDE

DEMOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE, WHICH DIFFERS FROM EXPECTED, AND CHANGES IN OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE CUMULATIVE UNRECOGNIZED LOSS WAS

THE DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE IN RECENT YEARS AND THE MEDICAL TREND, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN

EXPECTED. THESE LOSSES HAVE BEEN OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY THE RECOGNITION OF FUTURE SAVINGS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO MEDICARE PART D SUBSIDY PAYMENTS.

(B)

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2004, THE FIRM ASSUMED THE OBLIGATIONS OF HERITAGE BANK ONES PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THESE PLANS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND WERE MERGED INTO THE

FIRMS PLANS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004.

(C)

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 RESULTED IN A $35

DURING 2005, AN ADDITIONAL $116 MILLION REDUCTION WAS REFLECTED FOR RECOGNITION OF THE FINAL

MEDICARE PART D REGULATIONS ISSUED ON JANUARY 21, 2005.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

97

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS (I.E., U.S. PLANS NOT

SUBJECT TO TITLE IV OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT). THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE

PLANS IS THE EXCESS RETIREMENT PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES EARN SERVICE CREDITS ON

COMPENSATION AMOUNTS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM STIPULATED BY LAW. THIS PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED, NONCONTRIBUTORY U.S. PENSION PLAN WITH AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, IN THE AMOUNT

OF $273 MILLION AND $292 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PENSION PLAN

TOTALED $21 MILLION IN 2005, $28 MILLION IN 2004 AND $19 MILLION IN 2003.

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS

JPMORGAN CHASES EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS A BLENDED AVERAGE OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PROJECTED LONG-TERM

(10 YEARS OR MORE) RETURNS FOR THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, WEIGHTED BY THE PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION.

ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DEVELOPED USING A FORWARD-LOOKING BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH AND ARE NOT BASED

STRICTLY UPON HISTORICAL RETURNS. EQUITY RETURNS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION,

EXPECTED REAL EARNINGS GROWTH AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM DIVIDEND YIELD. BOND RETURNS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED AS THE SUM OF INFLATION, REAL BOND YIELD AND RISK SPREAD (AS APPROPRIATE), ADJUSTED FOR

THE EXPECTED EFFECT ON RETURNS FROM CHANGING YIELDS. OTHER ASSET-CLASS RETURNS ARE DERIVED FROM

THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS.

IN THE U.K., WHICH REPRESENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, PROCEDURES

SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION OF PLAN

ASSETS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.K. PLAN ASSETS IS AN AVERAGE OF PROJECTED LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR EACH

ASSET CLASS, SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON LONG-TERM U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND AA-RATED

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BONDS, PLUS AN EQUITY RISK PREMIUM ABOVE THE RISK-FREE RATE.

IN 2005, THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION UNDER THE U.S. PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WAS SELECTED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON A PORTFOLIO

OF BONDS WHOSE REDEMPTIONS AND COUPONS CLOSELY MATCH EACH OF THE PLANS PROJECTED CASH FLOWS; SUCH

PORTFOLIO IS DERIVED FROM A BROAD-BASED UNIVERSE OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. IN YEARS IN WHICH THIS HYPOTHETICAL BOND PORTFOLIO GENERATES EXCESS CASH, SUCH

EXCESS IS ASSUMED TO BE REINVESTED AT THE ONE-YEAR FORWARD RATES IMPLIED BY THE CITIGROUP PENSION

DISCOUNT CURVE PUBLISHED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. PRIOR TO 2005, DISCOUNT RATES WERE SELECTED BY

REFERENCE TO THE YEAR-END MOODYS CORPORATE AA RATE, AS WELL AS OTHER HIGH-QUALITY INDICES WITH A

DURATION THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE RESPECTIVE PLANS BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE

FOR THE U.K. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WAS DETERMINED BY MATCHING THE

DURATION OF THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS WITH THE CORRESPONDING DURATION FROM THE YIELD CURVE OF THE

YEAR-END IBOXX £ CORPORATE AA 15-YEAR-PLUS BOND INDEX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUALIZED ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE

PROJECTED AND ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR

(55

(A)

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2004, THE FIRM ASSUMED THE OBLIGATIONS OF HERITAGE BANK ONES PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THESE PLANS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JPMORGAN CHASE AND WERE MERGED INTO

THE FIRMS PLANS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004.

(B)

2003 REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FIRM REDUCED THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE ITS U.S. BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS TO 5.70% FOR THE PENSION PLAN AND TO 5.65% FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR RATE OF 5.75% FOR BOTH PLANS. THE FIRM ALSO CHANGED THE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT

OBLIGATION TREND ASSUMPTION TO 10% FOR 2006, GRADING DOWN TO AN ULTIMATE RATE OF 5% IN 2013. THE

2006 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ITS U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.50%. THE 2006

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE FIRMS COLI POST-RETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.00%;

HOWEVER, WITH THE MERGER OF BANK ONES OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS, THE FIRMS OVERALL

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS DECREASED TO

6.84% AND 6.80% IN 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, TO REFLECT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED RATE OF

RETURN FOR THE MERGED PLAN. THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE PENSION

BENEFITS CHANGED TO 5.00% FROM 4.75% IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES

WHICH WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF $18 MILLION. THE CHANGES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, TO THE

DISCOUNT RATES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE 2006 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES

BY APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION AND TO THE NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES

BY $23 MILLION. THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE ASSUMPTION OF 4.00% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE PRIOR JPMORGAN CHASE AND BANK ONE AGE-WEIGHTED INCREASE

ASSUMPTIONS; THE IMPACT TO EXPENSE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

JPMORGAN CHASES U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, A

25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS WOULD RESULT

IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION IN 2006 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

EXPENSES. A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN

INCREASE IN 2006 U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $20

MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $233 MILLION.

A 25-BASIS POINT DECLINE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE

IN THE 2006 NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES OF $12 MILLION. A 25-BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN 2006 U.S. PENSION

EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION

THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE FIRMS POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE

RISK-RETURN RELATIONSHIP AS APPROPRIATE TO THE RESPECTIVE PLANS NEEDS AND GOALS, USING A GLOBAL

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES DIVERSIFIED BY MARKET SEGMENT, ECONOMIC SECTOR, AND ISSUER.

SPECIFICALLY, THE GOAL IS TO OPTIMIZE THE ASSET MIX FOR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MANAGING

VARIOUS RISK FACTORS AND EACH PLANS INVESTMENT RETURN OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, LONG-DURATION FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ASSET ALLOCATION, IN

RECOGNITION OF ITS LONG-DURATION OBLIGATIONS. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL

AND EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, ARE REBALANCED TO TARGET, TO THE EXTENT

ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL.

THE FIRMS U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED

PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITIES (INCLUDING U.S. LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES),

FIXED INCOME (INCLUDING CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS), TREASURY INFLATION-INDEXED AND HIGH-YIELD

SECURITIES, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND OTHER SECURITIES. NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE HELD IN

VARIOUS TRUSTS AND ARE SIMILARLY INVESTED IN WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIOS OF EQUITY, FIXED INCOME

AND OTHER SECURITIES. ASSETS OF THE FIRMS COLI POLICIES, WHICH ARE USED TO FUND PARTIALLY THE U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN, ARE HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND ARE

INVESTED IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS. IN ADDITION, TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL DEBT SECURITIES,

HELD IN A TRUST, ARE USED TO FUND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE ASSETS USED TO

FUND THE FIRMS U.S. AND NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DO NOT

INCLUDE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN THIRD-PARTY

STOCK-INDEX FUNDS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

JPMORGAN CHASE OFFERS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN NON-U.S.

LOCATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PLANS IS THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, WHICH COVERS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRE-TAX

CONTRIBUTIONS TO TAX-DEFERRED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK FUND WITHIN

THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN IS A NONLEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN. THE FIRM MATCHES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS

UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF BENEFITS-ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION PER PAY PERIOD, SUBJECT TO PLAN AND

LEGAL LIMITS. EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO RECEIVE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING A SPECIFIED

SERVICE REQUIREMENT AND ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED IN SUCH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. THE FIRMS DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE PLANS TOTALED $392 MILLION IN 2005, $317 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$240 MILLION IN 2003.

NOTE 7  EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, JPMORGAN CHASE ADOPTED SFAS 123 USING THE PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION

METHOD. SFAS 123 REQUIRES ALL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS AND

STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM

CURRENTLY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND

SARS. STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER APB 25 USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, NO EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR

STOCK OPTIONS OR SARS GRANTED AT THE STOCK PRICE ON GRANT DATE, SINCE SUCH OPTIONS HAVE NO

INTRINSIC VALUE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) IS

MEASURED BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND THE STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OVER THE REQUIRED SERVICE PERIOD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE CONVERTED ALL OUTSTANDING BANK ONE EMPLOYEE

STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT THE MERGER DATE, AND THOSE AWARDS BECAME EXERCISABLE FOR OR BASED UPON

JPMORGAN CHASE COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF AWARDS CONVERTED, AND THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THOSE

AWARDS, WAS ADJUSTED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 123R, WHICH REVISES SFAS 123 AND SUPERSEDES APB 25. IN

MARCH 2005, THE SEC ISSUED SAB 107, WHICH PROVIDES INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ON SFAS 123R. ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING UNDER SFAS 123R IS GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THE SFAS 123 APPROACH. HOWEVER, SFAS 123R

REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

SARS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BASED UPON THEIR FAIR VALUES. PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE

IS NO LONGER AN ALTERNATIVE. SFAS 123R PERMITS ADOPTION USING ONE OF TWO METHODS  MODIFIED

PROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE. IN APRIL 2005, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

APPROVED A NEW RULE THAT, FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES, DELAYED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 123R TO NO LATER

THAN JANUARY 1, 2006. THE FIRM ADOPTED SFAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006, UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE

METHOD.

KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

IN 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE GRANTED LONG-TERM STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER THE 1996 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE

PLAN AS AMENDED (THE 1996 PLAN) UNTIL MAY 2005 AND UNDER THE 2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE

2005 PLAN) THEREAFTER TO CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. THESE TWO PLANS, PLUS PRIOR FIRM PLANS AND PLANS

ASSUMED AS THE RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, CONSTITUTE THE FIRMS PLANS (LTI PLANS). THE 2005 PLAN WAS

ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON MARCH 15, 2005, AND BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 17, 2005, AFTER

APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING. THE 2005 PLAN REPLACES THREE EXISTING STOCK

COMPENSATION PLANS  THE 1996 PLAN AND TWO NON-SHAREHOLDER

APPROVED PLANS  ALL OF WHICH EXPIRED IN

MAY 2005. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2005 PLAN, 275 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE DURING ITS FIVE-YEAR TERM. THE 2005 PLAN IS THE ONLY ACTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THE FIRM IS

CURRENTLY GRANTING STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS.

IN 2005, 15.5 MILLION SARS SETTLED ONLY IN SHARES AND 1.7 MILLION NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS WERE

GRANTED. UNDER THE LTI PLANS, STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS ARE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. GENERALLY, OPTIONS AND SARS CANNOT BE

EXERCISED UNTIL AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER VARIOUS PERIODS

AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT. THESE AWARDS GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT

DATE.

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FIRM ACCELERATED THE VESTING OF APPROXIMATELY 41 MILLION UNVESTED,

OUT-OF-THE-MONEY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2001 UNDER THE GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

PROGRAM (GPIP), WHICH WERE SCHEDULED TO VEST IN JANUARY 2007. THESE OPTIONS WERE NOT MODIFIED

OTHER THAN TO ACCELERATE VESTING. THE RELATED EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION, AND WAS

RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT AT THE

TIME THE OPTIONS WERE ACCELERATED THEY HAD LIMITED ECONOMIC VALUE SINCE THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE

ACCELERATED OPTIONS WAS $51.22 AND THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK ON THE EFFECTIVE

DATE OF THE ACCELERATION WAS $39.69.

(B)

LAPSED AWARDS REPRESENT BOTH RESTRICTED STOCK FOR WHICH RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED AND RSUS THAT HAVE BEEN

CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS ARE GRANTED BY JPMORGAN CHASE AT NO COST TO THE RECIPIENT. THESE

AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNTIL CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS HAVE LAPSED, INCLUDING CONTINUED

EMPLOYMENT FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD. THE RECIPIENT OF A SHARE OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS ENTITLED TO

VOTING RIGHTS AND DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON STOCK. AN RSU ENTITLES THE RECIPIENT TO RECEIVE A SHARE

OF COMMON STOCK AFTER THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE; THE RECIPIENT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH

PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ANY DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD THE RSU

IS OUTSTANDING. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2005, THE EQUITY PORTION OF THE FIRMS ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS

WERE GRANTED PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RSUS.

THE VESTING OF CERTAIN AWARDS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2002 IS CONDITIONED UPON CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

BEING MET AND JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK REACHING AND SUSTAINING TARGET PRICES WITHIN A

FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DURING 2002, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT

THE TARGET STOCK PRICES RELATED TO FORFEITABLE AWARDS GRANTED IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001 WOULD BE

ACHIEVED WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIODS, AND ACCORDINGLY, PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES

WERE REVERSED. THE TARGET STOCK PRICES FOR THESE AWARDS RANGE FROM $73.33 TO $85.00. THESE AWARDS

WERE FORFEITED AS FOLLOWS: 1.2 MILLION SHARES GRANTED IN 1999 WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2004; AND

1.2 MILLION SHARES GRANTED IN 2000 WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2005. ADDITIONALLY, 1.2 MILLION SHARES

GRANTED IN 2001 WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2006.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

NO BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS WERE MADE IN 2005. PRIOR AWARDS WERE GRANTED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE UNDER THE VALUE SHARING PLAN, A NON-SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PLAN. THE EXERCISE PRICE IS

EQUAL TO JPMORGAN CHASES COMMON STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. THE OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER

VARIOUS PERIODS AND GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

NOTE 9  SECURITIES AND

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS, HELD-TO-MATURITY (HTM) OR TRADING. TRADING SECURITIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGE 94 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AFS WHEN, IN

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, THEY MAY BE SOLD IN RESPONSE TO OR IN ANTICIPATION OF CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, OR AS PART OF THE FIRMS MANAGEMENT OF ITS STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK. AFS

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES AFTER SFAS 133 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS NET INCREASES OR DECREASES TO

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO

DETERMINE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SECURITIES /PRIVATE

EQUITY GAINS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SECURITIES THAT THE FIRM HAS THE POSITIVE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HTM AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT IS EVALUATED CONSIDERING NUMEROUS FACTORS, AND THEIR RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE VARIES

CASE TO CASE. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE MARKET VALUE

HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER OF THE

SECURITIES; AND THE FIRMS INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR AN

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE. IF, BASED UPON THE ANALYSIS, IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE

IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS.

INCLUDED IN THE $727 MILLION OF GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS

$391 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. THESE SECURITIES ARE PREDOMINATELY RATED AAA

AND THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DUE TO OVERALL INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND NOT DUE TO

UNDERLYING CREDIT CONCERNS OF THE ISSUERS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED

LOSSES AGED GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS HAVE A MARKET VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THAT IS WITHIN 4% OF

THEIR AMORTIZED COST BASIS.

IN CALCULATING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) AND COLLATERALIZED

MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMO), JPMORGAN CHASE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENTS.

MANAGEMENT REGULARLY PERFORMS SIMULATION TESTING TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT MARKET CONDITIONS

WOULD HAVE ON ITS MBS AND CMO PORTFOLIOS. MBSS AND CMOS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES HAVE PREPAYMENT

RISK ARE INCLUDED IN THE AFS PORTFOLIO AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.

BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME BY TOTAL AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE

APPLICABLE.

(B)

INCLUDES SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES

MBSS AND CMOS ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED UPON CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION,

WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED UPON A CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS

APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS FOR MBSS AND CMOS.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY HELD BY THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS WITHIN CORPORATE

(WHICH INCLUDES JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND ONE EQUITY PARTNERS BUSINESSES). THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS

INVESTS IN BUYOUTS, GROWTH EQUITY AND VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER INVESTMENT COMPANY GUIDELINES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE INVESTMENTS,

IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY, ARE CARRIED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING

FROM CHANGES IN VALUE ARE REPORTED IN SECURITIES/PRIVATE EQUITY GAINS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE GAINS OR LOSSES OCCUR.

PRIVATELY-HELD INVESTMENTS ARE INITIALLY VALUED BASED UPON COST. THE CARRYING VALUES OF

PRIVATELY-HELD INVESTMENTS ARE ADJUSTED FROM COST TO REFLECT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHANGES

EVIDENCED BY FINANCING EVENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTMENTS

ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS BY PRIVATE EQUITYS SENIOR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. A

VARIETY OF FACTORS ARE REVIEWED AND MONITORED TO ASSESS IMPAIRMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT, INDUSTRY

VALUATIONS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, CHANGES IN MARKET OUTLOOK AND THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING

ENVIRONMENT

NOTE 10  SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES

JPMORGAN CHASE ENTERS INTO RESALE AGREEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES BORROWED

TRANSACTIONS AND SECURITIES LOANED TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE FIRMS INVENTORY

POSITIONS, ACQUIRE SECURITIES TO COVER SHORT POSITIONS AND SETTLE OTHER SECURITIES OBLIGATIONS. THE

FIRM ALSO ENTERS INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS NEEDS.

SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS (RESALE AGREEMENTS) AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS) ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS AND ARE CARRIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THE AMOUNTS THE SECURITIES WILL

BE SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD OR REPURCHASED, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. WHERE APPROPRIATE, RESALE AND

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN

41. JPMORGAN CHASE TAKES POSSESSION OF SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS. ON A DAILY

BASIS, JPMORGAN CHASE MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM ITS

COUNTERPARTIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND

REQUESTS ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FROM ITS COUNTERPARTIES WHEN NECESSARY.

OVER TIME. THE VALUATION CONTROL GROUP WITHIN THE FINANCE AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE

ACCURACY OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS HELD BY PRIVATE EQUITY.

PRIVATE EQUITY ALSO HOLDS PUBLICLY-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GENERALLY OBTAINED THROUGH THE INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING OF PRIVATELY-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS. PUBLICLY-HELD INVESTMENTS ARE MARKED TO

MARKET AT THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE

EQUITY INCORPORATES THE USE OF DISCOUNTS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT IMMEDIATELY

REALIZE OR RISK-MANAGE THE QUOTED PUBLIC VALUES AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY AND/OR CONTRACTUAL SALES

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THESE HOLDINGS.

TRANSACTIONS SIMILAR TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT MEET THE SFAS 140 DEFINITION OF A

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS BUYS AND SELLS RATHER THAN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE (SALE) OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WITH A

FORWARD OBLIGATION TO SELL (PURCHASE) THE SECURITIES. THE FORWARD PURCHASE (SALE) OBLIGATION, A

DERIVATIVE, IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LENT ARE RECORDED AT THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL ADVANCED OR

RECEIVED. SECURITIES BORROWED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF GOVERNMENT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. JPMORGAN CHASE

MONITORS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES BORROWED AND LENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND CALLS FOR

ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHEN APPROPRIATE. FEES RECEIVED OR PAID ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME OR

INTEREST EXPENSE.

SECURED PARTY ARE IDENTIFIED AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED (PLEDGED TO VARIOUS PARTIES) ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FIRM HAD RECEIVED SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL THAT CAN BE REPLEDGED,

DELIVERED OR OTHERWISE USED WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $331 BILLION. THIS COLLATERAL WAS

GENERALLY OBTAINED UNDER RESALE OR SECURITIES BORROWING AGREEMENTS. OF THESE SECURITIES,

APPROXIMATELY $320 BILLION WERE REPLEDGED, DELIVERED OR OTHERWISE USED, GENERALLY AS COLLATERAL

UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS OR TO COVER SHORT SALES.

NOTE 11  LOANS

LOANS ARE REPORTED AT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING, NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES,

UNEARNED INCOME AND ANY NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES. LOANS HELD FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR FAIR VALUE, WITH VALUATION CHANGES RECORDED IN NONINTEREST REVENUE. LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED AS

TRADING WHERE POSITIONS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD TO MAKE PROFITS FROM SHORT-TERM MOVEMENTS IN PRICE.

LOANS HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES ARE INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH

GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN TRADING REVENUE. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE INTEREST

METHOD, OR ON A BASIS APPROXIMATING A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.

NONACCRUAL LOANS ARE THOSE ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED. LOANS (OTHER THAN

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS DISCUSSED BELOW) ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS IN DOUBT, OR WHEN PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST IS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST. INTEREST ACCRUED BUT NOT COLLECTED AT THE DATE A LOAN IS PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS IS

REVERSED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED LOAN FEES IS

SUSPENDED. INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS IS RECOGNIZED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS RECEIVED IN

CASH. HOWEVER, WHERE THERE IS DOUBT REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF LOAN PRINCIPAL, ALL

CASH THEREAFTER RECEIVED IS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH LOANS. LOANS ARE RESTORED

TO ACCRUAL STATUS ONLY WHEN INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE BROUGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS

ARE REASONABLY ASSURED.

CONSUMER LOANS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED

STAGES OF DELINQUENCY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(FFIEC) POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, CREDIT CARD LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF BY THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH

THE ACCOUNT BECOMES 180 DAYS PAST DUE OR WITHIN 60 DAYS FROM RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE FILING

OF BANKRUPTCY, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE AT 180 DAYS PAST DUE. OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED OFF (TO NET

REALIZABLE VALUE IF COLLATERALIZED) AT 120 DAYS PAST DUE. ACCRUED INTEREST ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE

PRODUCTS, AND AUTOMOBILE AND EDUCATION FINANCINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NONACCRUAL LOAN POLICY DISCUSSED

IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. INTEREST AND FEES RELATED TO CREDIT CARD LOANS CONTINUE TO ACCRUE UNTIL

THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF OR PAID. ACCRUED INTEREST ON ALL OTHER CONSUMER LOANS IS GENERALLY REVERSED

AGAINST INTEREST INCOME WHEN THE LOAN IS CHARGED OFF. A COLLATERALIZED LOAN IS CONSIDERED AN

IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURE AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED IN LOAN SATISFACTIONS, WITHIN OTHER

ASSETS, ONLY WHEN JPMORGAN CHASE HAS TAKEN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE COLLATERAL, BUT REGARDLESS OF

WHETHER FORMAL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRED LOANS UNDER SFAS 114 IS INCLUDED IN JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTE 12  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

JPMORGAN CHASES ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES COVERS THE WHOLESALE (RISK-RATED) AND CONSUMER

(SCORED) LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN

THE FIRMS LOAN PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT ALSO COMPUTES AN ALLOWANCE FOR WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED

COMMITMENTS USING A METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOANS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INCLUDES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT AND A FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT.

WITHIN THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT IS A STATISTICAL CALCULATION AND AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE

STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT RELATES TO PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND

MEASURED PURSUANT TO SFAS 114. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (OR

COLLATERAL VALUE OR OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICE) OF THE LOAN IS LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT

LOAN. TO COMPUTE THE ASSET-SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF THE ALLOWANCE, LARGER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED

INDIVIDUALLY, AND SMALLER IMPAIRED LOANS ARE EVALUATED AS A POOL USING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE

FOR THE RESPECTIVE CLASS OF ASSETS.

THE FORMULA-BASED COMPONENT COVERS PERFORMING WHOLESALE AND CONSUMER LOANS AND IS THE PRODUCT OF A

STATISTICAL CALCULATION, AS WELL AS ADJUSTMENTS TO SUCH CALCULATION. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TAKE INTO

CONSIDERATION MODEL IMPRECISION, EXTERNAL FACTORS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT ARE

NOT YET REFLECTED IN THE FACTORS USED TO DERIVE THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION.

THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION IS THE PRODUCT OF PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT. FOR

RISK-RATED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE WHOLESALE LINES OF BUSINESS), THESE FACTORS ARE

DIFFERENTIATED BY RISK RATING AND MATURITY. FOR SCORED LOANS (GENERALLY LOANS ORIGINATED BY THE

CONSUMER LINES OF BUSINESS), LOSS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY APPLYING STATISTICAL LOSS FACTORS AND

OTHER RISK INDICATORS TO POOLS OF LOANS BY ASSET TYPE. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION

FOR THE RISK-RATED PORTFOLIOS ARE DETERMINED BY CREATING ESTIMATED RANGES USING HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE OF BOTH LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT AND PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. FACTORS RELATED TO CONCENTRATED

AND DETERIORATING INDUSTRIES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE CALCULATION WHERE RELEVANT. ADJUSTMENTS

TO THE STATISTICAL CALCULATION FOR THE SCORED LOAN PORTFOLIOS ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY ANALYZING

THE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT SEGMENT. THE ESTIMATED RANGES AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE POINT WITHIN THE RANGE ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO CURRENT MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, QUALITY OF

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE CREDIT

LOSSES INHERENT IN THE FIRMS PROCESS OF EXTENDING CREDIT. MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHES AN ASSET-SPECIFIC

ALLOWANCE FOR LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND COMPUTES A FORMULA-BASED

ALLOWANCE FOR PERFORMING WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THESE ARE COMPUTED USING A

METHODOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO, MODIFIED FOR EXPECTED MATURITIES

AND PROBABILITIES OF DRAWDOWN.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER OF THE

FIRM, THE RISK POLICY COMMITTEE, A RISK SUBGROUP OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FIRM

RELATIVE TO THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FIRMS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE DEEMED THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO BE APPROPRIATE (I.E.,

SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB LOSSES THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THOSE NOT YET

IDENTIFIABLE).

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, MANAGEMENT MODIFIED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE PROVISION FOR

CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE COMBINED FIRM. THE EFFECT OF CONFORMING METHODOLOGIES IN 2004 WAS A DECREASE

IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE OF $254 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN THE WHOLESALE ALLOWANCE (INCLUDING BOTH

FUNDED LOANS AND LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS) OF $330 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE BANK ONE SELLERS

INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS WAS DECERTIFICATED; THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO THE

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION (PRE-TAX) IN 2004.

NOTE 13  LOAN SECURITIZATIONS

JPMORGAN CHASE SECURITIZES, SELLS AND SERVICES VARIOUS CONSUMER LOANS, SUCH AS CONSUMER REAL

ESTATE, CREDIT CARD AND AUTOMOBILE LOANS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN WHOLESALE LOANS (PRIMARILY REAL

ESTATE) ORIGINATED BY THE INVESTMENT BANK. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTMENT BANK PURCHASES, PACKAGES AND

SECURITIZES COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOANS. ALL IB ACTIVITY IS COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO BELOW AS

WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES. INTERESTS IN THE SOLD AND SECURITIZED LOANS MAY BE RETAINED.

THE FIRM RECORDS A LOAN SECURITIZATION AS A SALE WHEN THE TRANSFERRED LOANS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED

FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS AND THE ACCOUNTING CRITERIA FOR A SALE ARE MET. THOSE CRITERIA ARE (1)

THE ASSETS ARE LEGALLY ISOLATED FROM THE FIRMS CREDITORS; (2) THE ENTITY CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE

THE FINANCIAL ASSETS OR, IF THE ENTITY IS A QSPE, ITS INVESTORS CAN PLEDGE OR EXCHANGE THEIR

INTERESTS; AND (3) THE FIRM DOES NOT MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL VIA AN AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE THE

ASSETS BEFORE THEIR MATURITY OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNILATERALLY CAUSE THE HOLDER TO RETURN THE

ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED ON LOAN SECURITIZATIONS DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE

LOANS SOLD AND ARE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE LOANS SOLD AND THE RETAINED INTERESTS, BASED UPON THEIR

RELATIVE FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE OF SALE. GAINS ON SECURITIZATIONS ARE REPORTED IN NONINTEREST

REVENUE. SINCE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM USUALLY ESTIMATES THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE RETAINED INTERESTS BY DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE EXPECTED CASH

FLOWS USING MODELING TECHNIQUES. SUCH MODELS INCORPORATE MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES OF KEY

VARIABLES, SUCH AS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND THE DISCOUNT RATES APPROPRIATE FOR

THE RISKS INVOLVED.

RETAINED INTERESTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK, SUCH THAT JPMORGAN CHASE MAY NOT RECOVER

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE; SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE

REFLECTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN EARNINGS, IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RETAINED INTEREST

HAS DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND SUCH DECLINE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

INTERESTS IN THE SECURITIZED LOANS ARE GENERALLY RETAINED BY THE FIRM IN THE FORM OF SENIOR OR

SUBORDINATED INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS, SUBORDINATED TRANCHES, ESCROW ACCOUNTS AND SERVICING RIGHTS, AND

THEY ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION TRUSTS REQUIRE

THE FIRM TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN THE TRUSTS, REPRESENTING THE FIRMS INTERESTS

IN THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUST THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SECURITIZED. THESE INTERESTS ARE NOT

REPRESENTED BY SECURITY CERTIFICATES. THE FIRMS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST

AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LOANS. RETAINED INTERESTS FROM WHOLESALE ACTIVITIES ARE REFLECTED AS TRADING

ASSETS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RETAINS SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND

AUTOMOBILE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS AND FOR CERTAIN WHOLESALE ACTIVITY SECURITIZATIONS IT SPONSORS, AND

RECEIVES SERVICING FEES BASED ON THE SECURITIZED LOAN BALANCE PLUS CERTAIN ANCILLARY FEES. THE FIRM

ALSO RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SERVICE THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IT SELLS IN CONNECTION WITH

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (GNMA),

FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FNMA) AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (FREDDIE

MAC). FOR A DISCUSSION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT.

JPMORGAN CHASE-SPONSORED SECURITIZATIONS UTILIZE SPES AS PART OF THE SECURITIZATION PROCESS. THESE

SPES ARE STRUCTURED TO MEET THE DEFINITION OF A QSPE (AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 91 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT); ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF SECURITIZATION-RELATED QSPES ARE NOT

REFLECTED IN THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (EXCEPT FOR RETAINED INTERESTS, AS DESCRIBED

BELOW) BUT ARE INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE QSPE PURCHASING THE

$2.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO SUBORDINATED INTERESTS IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES ON THE

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES, NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATION

RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS. THE FIRM MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN PRINCIPAL

RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 23% FOR BOTH 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED

IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS

NOTE 14  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE 91 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASES

POLICIES REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES PRINCIPAL INVOLVEMENT WITH VIES OCCURS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



INVESTMENT BANK: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A

COST-EFFICIENT MANNER BY PROVIDING THE STRUCTURAL FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THEIR NEEDS PERTAINING TO

PRICE, YIELD AND DESIRED RISK. THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES IN THE

IB: (1) MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND (2) CLIENT INTERMEDIATION; BOTH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE IB ALSO

SECURITIZES LOANS THROUGH QSPES WHICH ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIES, TO CREATE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES,

AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.



ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT: PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE

FIRMS MUTUAL FUNDS DEEMED VIES. AWM EARNS A FIXED FEE BASED UPON ASSETS MANAGED; THE FEE VARIES

WITH EACH FUNDS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND IS COMPETITIVELY PRICED. FOR THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FUNDS

THAT QUALIFY AS VIES, AWMS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH FUNDS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES: PROVIDES TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES TO A NUMBER OF VIES.

THESE SERVICES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED TO NON-VIES. TSS EARNS MARKET-BASED FEES FOR SERVICES

PROVIDED. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS UNDER FIN 46R.



COMMERCIAL BANKING: UTILIZES VIES TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN ACCESSING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN A

COST-EFFICIENT MANNER. THIS IS OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO THOSE

OFFERED IN THE INVESTMENT BANK.

COMMERCIAL BANKING MAY ASSIST IN THE STRUCTURING AND/OR ON-GOING ADMINISTRATION OF THESE VIES AND

MAY PROVIDE LIQUIDITY, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND/OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE VIE.



THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, IS INVOLVED WITH ENTITIES THAT MAY BE

DEEMED VIES. PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT COMPANY

AUDIT GUIDE (AUDIT GUIDE). THE FASB DEFERRED ADOPTION OF FIN 46R FOR NON-REGISTERED INVESTMENT

COMPANIES THAT APPLY THE AUDIT GUIDE UNTIL THE PROPOSED STATEMENT OF POSITION ON THE CLARIFICATION

OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT GUIDE IS FINALIZED. THE FIRM CONTINUES TO APPLY THIS DEFERRAL PROVISION;

HAD FIN 46R BEEN APPLIED TO VIES SUBJECT TO THIS DEFERRAL, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE HAD AN

INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING VIES WITH WHICH THE IB IS

INVOLVED: MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS AND CLIENT INTERMEDIATION. THESE CATEGORIES ARE DISCUSSED MORE

FULLY BELOW.

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS

THE FIRM IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES BUSINESS, HELPING MEET CUSTOMERS

FINANCING NEEDS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS THROUGH VIES KNOWN AS

MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THESE ENTITIES ARE SEPARATE BANKRUPTCY-REMOTE CORPORATIONS IN THE BUSINESS

OF PURCHASING INTERESTS IN, AND MAKING LOANS SECURED BY, RECEIVABLE POOLS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

ASSETS PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE ENTITIES FUND THEIR PURCHASES AND LOANS THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF HIGHLY-RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL

PAPER IS THE CASH FLOW FROM THE POOLS OF ASSETS.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

111

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

JPMORGAN CHASE SERVES AS THE ADMINISTRATOR AND PROVIDES CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AND

LIMITED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FOR SEVERAL MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE

CONDUITS IS BACKED BY COLLATERAL, CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY

SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT RECEIVING AT LEAST A LIQUIDITY RATING OF A-1, P-1 AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, F1.

AS A MEANS OF ENSURING TIMELY REPAYMENT OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER, EACH ASSET POOL FINANCED BY THE

CONDUITS HAS A MINIMUM 100% DEAL-SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY FACILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IN THE UNLIKELY

EVENT AN ASSET POOL IS REMOVED FROM THE CONDUIT, THE ADMINISTRATOR CAN DRAW ON THE LIQUIDITY

FACILITY TO REPAY THE MATURING COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN THE FORM

OF ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE BANK LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED

BY PURCHASING, OR LENDING AGAINST, A POOL OF NON-DEFAULTED, PERFORMING ASSETS. DEAL-SPECIFIC

LIQUIDITY IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR THE CONDUITS.

PROGRAM-WIDE LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF REVOLVING AND SHORT-TERM LENDING COMMITMENTS ALSO IS PROVIDED

BY THE FIRM TO THESE VEHICLES IN THE EVENT OF SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET.

DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT ENHANCEMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE CONDUITS IS

GENERALLY STRUCTURED TO COVER A MULTIPLE OF HISTORICAL LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE POOL OF ASSETS AND IS

PROVIDED PRIMARILY BY CUSTOMERS (I.E., SELLERS) OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. THE DEAL-SPECIFIC CREDIT

ENHANCEMENT IS TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF OVER-COLLATERALIZATION PROVIDED BY THE SELLER BUT ALSO MAY

INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: RECOURSE TO THE SELLER OR ORIGINATOR, CASH COLLATERAL

ACCOUNTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT, EXCESS SPREAD, RETENTION OF SUBORDINATED INTERESTS OR THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE FIRM PROVIDES LIMITED CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IN THE FORM OF

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT.

SINCE THE FIRM PROVIDES CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AND LIQUIDITY TO THESE MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, THE

MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IS NOT ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE ABSORBED BY THIRD-PARTY LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS.

(B)

IN DECEMBER 2003 AND FEBRUARY 2004, TWO MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS WERE RESTRUCTURED, WITH EACH

CONDUIT ISSUING PREFERRED SECURITIES ACQUIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY INVESTOR; THE INVESTOR

ABSORBS THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE CONDUIT. IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

OF THE RESTRUCTURED CONDUITS, THE FIRM LEVERAGED AN EXISTING RATING AGENCY MODEL  AN INDEPENDENT

MARKET STANDARD  TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES, AND THE FIRM CONSIDERED THE

RELATIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDERS.

THE FIRM VIEWS ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE TO MULTI-SELLER CONDUIT TRANSACTIONS AS LIMITED. THIS IS

BECAUSE, FOR THE MOST PART, THE FIRM IS NOT REQUIRED TO FUND UNDER THE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IF THE

ASSETS IN THE VIE ARE IN DEFAULT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRMS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

ARE SECONDARY TO THE RISK OF FIRST LOSS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES  FOR

EXAMPLE, BY THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF THE VIE WITH THE ASSETS SOLD TO IT OR NOTES SUBORDINATED

TO THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES.

CLIENT INTERMEDIATION

AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY, THE FIRM IS INVOLVED IN STRUCTURING VIE TRANSACTIONS TO MEET INVESTOR

AND CLIENT NEEDS. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES VARIOUS TYPES OF RISKS (INCLUDING FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND

CREDIT), TYPICALLY USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW. IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FIRM ALSO PROVIDES LIQUIDITY AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE VIES TO FACILITATE THE

TRANSACTION. THE FIRMS CURRENT EXPOSURE TO NONCONSOLIDATED VIES IS REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS OR IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RISKS INHERENT IN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OR LIQUIDITY COMMITMENTS ARE MANAGED SIMILARLY TO OTHER CREDIT, MARKET AND

LIQUIDITY RISKS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS EXPOSED. THE FIRM INTERMEDIATES PRINCIPALLY WITH THE FOLLOWING

TYPES OF VIES: CREDIT-LINKED NOTE VEHICLES AND MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES.

112

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM STRUCTURES CREDIT-LINKED NOTES IN WHICH THE VIE PURCHASES HIGHLY-RATED ASSETS (SUCH AS

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES) AND ENTERS INTO A CREDIT DERIVATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE FIRM TO OBTAIN

EXPOSURE TO A REFERENCED CREDIT NOT HELD BY THE VIE. CREDIT-LINKED NOTES ARE ISSUED BY THE VIE TO

TRANSFER THE RISK OF THE REFERENCED CREDIT TO THE INVESTORS IN THE VIE. CLIENTS AND INVESTORS OFTEN

PREFER A VIE STRUCTURE, SINCE THE CREDIT-LINKED NOTES GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING THAN

THEY WOULD IF ISSUED DIRECTLY BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM IS INVOLVED WITH MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A SERIES OF SECONDARY

MARKET TRUSTS THAT ALLOW TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS TO FINANCE THEIR INVESTMENTS AT SHORT-TERM TAX-EXEMPT

RATES. THE VIE PURCHASES FIXED-RATE, LONGER-TERM HIGHLY-RATED MUNICIPAL BONDS BY ISSUING PUTTABLE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES AND INVERSE FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES; THE INVESTORS IN THE INVERSE

FLOATING-RATE CERTIFICATES ARE EXPOSED TO THE RESIDUAL LOSSES OF THE VIE (THE RESIDUAL

INTERESTS). FOR VEHICLES IN WHICH THE FIRM OWNS THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRM CONSOLIDATES THE

VIE. IN VEHICLES WHERE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS OWN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS, THE FIRMS EXPOSURE IS

LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING MUNICIPAL BONDS, THE UNWIND TRIGGERS

BASED UPON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS HELD BY THIRD

PARTIES. THE FIRM OFTEN SERVES AS REMARKETING AGENT FOR THE VIE AND PROVIDES LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT

THE REMARKETING.

ASSETS HELD BY CREDIT-LINKED AND MUNICIPAL BOND VEHICLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, WERE AS

AND $5.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

FINALLY, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH VIES STRUCTURED BY OTHER PARTIES. THESE

TRANSACTIONS CAN INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, ACTING

AS A DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER, INVESTOR, UNDERWRITER, PLACEMENT AGENT, TRUSTEE

OR CUSTODIAN. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT ARMS LENGTH, AND INDIVIDUAL CREDIT DECISIONS ARE

BASED UPON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC VIE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS. JPMORGAN CHASE RECORDS AND REPORTS THESE POSITIONS SIMILARLY TO ANY OTHER

THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTION. THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE JPMORGAN CHASE TO ABSORB A MAJORITY OF THE

EXPECTED LOSSES OF THE VIES OR TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE VIE, AND THEY

ARE NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES INCLUDE INTERESTS IN RECEIVABLES PURCHASED BY

FIRM-ADMINISTERED CONDUITS, WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46R. INTERESTS IN

PURCHASED RECEIVABLES ARE CARRIED AT COST AND ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. BASED UPON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF CREDIT PROTECTION SPECIFIED

IN EACH TRANSACTION, PRIMARILY THROUGH OVERCOLLATERALIZATION, THE FIRM DETERMINED THAT NO

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE INTEREST-BEARING BENEFICIAL INTEREST LIABILITIES ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN

THE LINE ITEM TITLED, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE HOLDERS OF THESE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS DO NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO

THE GENERAL CREDIT OF JPMORGAN CHASE. SEE NOTE 17 ON PAGE 117 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE

MATURITY PROFILE OF FIN 46 LONG-TERM BENEFICIAL INTERESTS.

FIN 46R TRANSITION

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A REVISION TO FIN 46 (FIN 46R) TO ADDRESS VARIOUS TECHNICAL

CORRECTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT HAD ARISEN SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF FIN 46. EFFECTIVE MARCH

31, 2004, JPMORGAN CHASE IMPLEMENTED FIN 46R FOR ALL VIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MADE BY

ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R DID NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 15  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142 AT THE

REPORTING-UNIT SEGMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS (AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 31 ON PAGES 130131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT); PLUS PRIVATE EQUITY

(WHICH IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE). GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY (DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER) OR MORE

OFTEN IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, INDICATE THERE

MAY BE IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT

INSTEAD ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DETERMINED TO HAVE FINITE LIVES, SUCH AS CORE DEPOSITS AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS, ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES IN A MANNER THAT BEST REFLECTS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED PERIODICALLY ON THESE AMORTIZING

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

JPMORGAN CHASE RECOGNIZES AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE RIGHT

TO PERFORM SPECIFIED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING ACTIVITIES FOR OTHERS. MSRS ARE EITHER

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES OR RETAINED UPON SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. SERVICING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COLLECTING PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND ESCROW PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS; MAKING TAX

AND INSURANCE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWERS; MONITORING DELINQUENCIES AND EXECUTING

FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND REMITTING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE

INVESTORS OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

THE AMOUNT CAPITALIZED AS MSRS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PAID TO THIRD PARTIES TO ACQUIRE MSRS OR IS

BASED ON FAIR VALUE, IF RETAINED UPON THE SALE OR SECURITIZATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS. THE FIRM

ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS USING A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, CONTRACTUALLY SPECIFIED SERVICING FEES, PREPAYMENT ASSUMPTIONS,

DELINQUENCY RATES, LATE CHARGES, OTHER ANCILLARY REVENUES AND COSTS TO SERVICE, AS WELL AS OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE FIRM ENHANCED ITS VALUATION OF MSRS BY UTILIZING AN

OPTION-ADJUSTED SPREAD (OAS) VALUATION APPROACH. AN OAS APPROACH PROJECTS MSR CASH FLOWS OVER

MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRMS PROPRIETARY

PREPAYMENT MODEL, AND THEN DISCOUNTS THESE CASH FLOWS AT RISK-ADJUSTED RATES. PRIOR TO THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005, MSRS WERE VALUED USING CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY A STATIC OR

SINGLE INTEREST RATE PATH VALUATION MODEL. THE INITIAL VALUATION OF MSRS UNDER OAS DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FIRM COMPARES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA WHERE AVAILABLE

AND TO RECENT MARKET ACTIVITY AND ACTUAL PORTFOLIO EXPERIENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES ARE SUPPORTABLE AND REASONABLE.

THE FIRM ACCOUNTS FOR ITS MSRS AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 140.

MSRS ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF THE ACTUAL SERVICING INCOME RECEIVED IN PROPORTION TO, AND

OVER THE PERIOD OF, THE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SERVICING INCOME STREAM OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE

LOANS. FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND MEASURING IMPAIRMENT OF MSRS, THE FIRM STRATIFIES THE

PORTFOLIO ON THE BASIS OF THE PREDOMINANT RISK CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH ARE LOAN TYPE AND INTEREST

RATE. ANY INDICATED IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE THROUGH A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRATUM EXCEEDS ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

114

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM EVALUATES OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY REVIEWING CHANGES IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER

MARKET INTEREST RATES OVER HISTORICAL PERIODS AND THEN DETERMINES AN INTEREST RATE SCENARIO TO

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF THE MSRS GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND THE RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT

COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ANY GROSS CARRYING VALUE AND RELATED

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, BASED

UPON THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THEIR EFFECT ON

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. JPMORGAN CHASE USES A COMBINATION OF DERIVATIVES, AFS SECURITIES AND TRADING

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS. THE INTENT IS TO OFFSET ANY CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF MSRS WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENT. MSRS

DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES DECLINE. CONVERSELY, SECURITIES (SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES), PRINCIPAL-ONLY CERTIFICATES AND DERIVATIVES (WHEN THE FIRM RECEIVES FIXED-RATE

INTEREST PAYMENTS) DECREASE IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES INCREASE. THE FIRM OFFSETS THE INTEREST

RATE RISK OF ITS MSRS BY DESIGNATING CERTAIN DERIVATIVES (E.G., A COMBINATION OF SWAPS, SWAPTIONS

AND FLOORS THAT PRODUCES AN INTEREST RATE PROFILE OPPOSITE TO THE DESIGNATED RISK OF THE HEDGED

MSRS) AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF SPECIFIED MSRS UNDER SFAS 133. SFAS 133 HEDGE ACCOUNTING ALLOWS THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED MSRS TO BE ADJUSTED THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE

CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGING DERIVATIVES IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS. BOTH OF THESE VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

WHEN APPLYING SFAS 133, THE LOANS UNDERLYING THE MSRS BEING HEDGED ARE STRATIFIED INTO SPECIFIC

SFAS 133 ASSET GROUPINGS THAT POSSESS SIMILAR INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT RISK EXPOSURES. THE

DOCUMENTED HEDGE PERIOD FOR THE FIRM IS DAILY. DAILY ADJUSTMENTS ARE PERFORMED TO INCORPORATE NEW

OR TERMINATED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND TO MODIFY THE AMOUNT OF THE CORRESPONDING SIMILAR ASSET

GROUPING THAT IS BEING HEDGED. THE FIRM HAS DESIGNATED CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE

(LIBOR) AS THE HEDGED RISK. IN DESIGNATING THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE

IMPACT THAT THE CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK RATE HAS ON THE PREPAYMENT SPEED ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS. THE FIRM PERFORMS BOTH PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE

HEDGE-EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIONS, USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP IS EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE

CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE MSRS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES TO THE CHANGE IN THE

VALUE OF THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 26 ON PAGE 123 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

SECURITIES (BOTH AFS AND TRADING) ALSO ARE USED TO MANAGE THE RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS. BECAUSE THESE

SECURITIES DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS 115. REALIZED

AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON TRADING SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN MORTGAGE FEES

AND RELATED INCOME; INTEREST INCOME ON THE AFS SECURITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN NET INTEREST

INCOME; AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AFS SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. FINALLY, CERTAIN NONHEDGE DERIVATIVES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED BY MANAGEMENT IN SFAS

133 HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS, ARE USED TO MANAGE THE ECONOMIC RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS AND ARE RECORDED IN

MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME.

CERTAIN AFS SECURITIES PURCHASED BY THE FIRM TO MANAGE STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK WERE

DESIGNATED IN 2005 AS RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS OF MSRS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE

UNREALIZED LOSS ON AFS SECURITIES USED TO MANAGE THE RISK EXPOSURE OF MSRS WAS $174 MILLION AND $3

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES MSR ACTIVITY AND RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR THE DATES INDICATED. IT

ALSO INCLUDES THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF MSRS AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, TO IMMEDIATE 10% AND 20% ADVERSE CHANGES IN EACH OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS HYPOTHETICAL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH

CAUTION. AS THE FIGURES INDICATE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED UPON A 10% AND 20% VARIATION IN

ASSUMPTIONS GENERALLY CANNOT BE EASILY EXTRAPOLATED BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHANGE IN THE

ASSUMPTIONS TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE MAY NOT BE LINEAR. ALSO, IN THIS TABLE, THE EFFECT THAT A

CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR ASSUMPTION MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED WITHOUT CHANGING ANY

OTHER ASSUMPTION. IN REALITY, CHANGES IN ONE FACTOR MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN ANOTHER, WHICH MIGHT

MAGNIFY OR COUNTERACT THE SENSITIVITIES.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE REPRESENTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF MSRS EXCEEDS ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR ITS APPLICABLE SFAS 140 STRATA. CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ARE THE

RESULT OF THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT OR THE RECOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE PERIOD. THE CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR

MSRS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

THE FIRM RECORDED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF ITS MSRS OF $1 MILLION, $149 MILLION

AND $283 MILLION, IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH PERMANENTLY REDUCED THE GROSS

CARRYING VALUE OF THE MSRS AND THE RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE. THE

PERMANENT REDUCTION PRECLUDES SUBSEQUENT REVERSALS. THIS WRITE-DOWN HAD NO IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE FIRM.

PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS AND ALL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DURING 2005, PURCHASED CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIP INTANGIBLES DECREASED BY $603 MILLION AS A RESULT

OF $703 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE OF THE SEARS CANADA

CREDIT CARD BUSINESS. ALL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS DECREASED BY $894 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF $836 MILLION IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND THE IMPACT OF THE DECONSOLIDATION OF PAYMENTECH.

EXCEPT FOR $513 MILLION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES RELATED TO ASSET MANAGEMENT ADVISORY

CONTRACTS WHICH ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, THE

REMAINDER OF THE FIRMS OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION.

NOTE 16  PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. JPMORGAN CHASE COMPUTES DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET. FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THE FIRM USES THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD COMPUTED OVER THE LESSER OF THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASED FACILITY OR 10

YEARS. JPMORGAN CHASE HAS RECORDED IMMATERIAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

RELATED TO ASBESTOS REMEDIATION UNDER SFAS 143 AND FIN 47 IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT HAS SUFFICIENT

INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE THE OBLIGATIONS FAIR VALUE.

NET WITH THE HOST CONTRACT ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SEPARATED DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED IN TRADING REVENUE.

(B)

THE INTEREST RATES SHOWN ARE THE RANGE OF CONTRACTUAL RATES IN EFFECT AT YEAR-END, INCLUDING

NON-U.S. DOLLAR FIXED AND VARIABLE-RATE ISSUANCES, WHICH EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO THE

CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVES, THE

RANGE OF MODIFIED RATES IN EFFECT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS 0.49% TO

17.00%, VERSUS THE CONTRACTUAL RANGE OF 0.22% TO 17.00% PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

(D)

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, LONG-TERM DEBT AGGREGATING $27.7 BILLION WAS REDEEMABLE AT THE OPTION OF

JPMORGAN CHASE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, PRIOR TO MATURITY, BASED UPON THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE

RESPECTIVE NOTES.

(E)

THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT MATURES IN EACH OF THE FIVE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO

(F)

INCLUDES $2.3 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING ZERO-COUPON NOTES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THESE NOTES AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITIES IS $5.9 BILLION.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT WAS 4.62% AND 4.50% AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE AND

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, JPMORGAN CHASE UTILIZES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY

INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF ITS DEBT ISSUES.

THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MODIFIES THE FIRMS INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE ASSOCIATED DEBT. THE

MODIFIED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WAS 4.65% AND 3.97% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. (PARENT COMPANY) HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

BOTH LONG-TERM DEBT AND STRUCTURED NOTES SOLD AS PART OF THE FIRMS TRADING ACTIVITIES. THESE

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER VARIOUS EMPLOYEE OR DIRECTOR INCENTIVE, COMPENSATION, OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE

PLANS.

NOTE 20  EARNINGS PER SHARE

SFAS 128 REQUIRES THE PRESENTATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IN THE

INCOME STATEMENT. BASIC EPS IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCK BY THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED USING

THE SAME METHOD AS BASIC EPS BUT, IN THE DENOMINATOR, THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES REFLECT, IN

ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING SHARES, THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED OR EXERCISED INTO COMMON STOCK. NET INCOME

AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK IS THE SAME FOR BASIC EPS AND DILUTED EPS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE HAD NO

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE, NO ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCK WERE

NECESSARY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CALCULATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR 2005, 2004 AND

INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR BOOK AND TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, A DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY OR ASSET FOR EACH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE TAX RATES THAT THE

FIRM EXPECTS TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE UNDERLYING ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE REALIZED. JPMORGAN

CHASES EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED PORTIONS OF THAT EXPENSE. A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THE FIRM EXPECTS TO

REALIZE.

DUE TO THE INHERENT COMPLEXITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND FROM

CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND BEING TAXED IN A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED TO BE MADE. AGREEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES BETWEEN JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE

MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM FILES TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE FINALIZED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

2005, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED PRE-TAX EARNINGS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES APPROXIMATED

$1.5 BILLION. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW.

THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS

AT A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED U.S. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY PROVIDING A DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION ON

THE REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. TAXPAYER (THE REPATRIATION PROVISION).

THE NEW DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE FIRM APPLIED THE REPATRIATION PROVISION TO $1.9 BILLION OF CASH

FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS, RESULTING IN A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $55 MILLION. THE $1.9 BILLION OF CASH WILL

BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRMS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN PURSUANT TO THE GUIDELINES SET

FORTH IN THE ACT.

THE TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) APPLICABLE TO SECURITIES GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE YEARS 2005, 2004 AND

2003 WAS $(536) MILLION, $126 MILLION AND $477 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 23  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS

JPMORGAN CHASE BANKS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND REGULATION BY THE OFFICE OF THE

COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC). THE BANK IS A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND ITS

DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC).

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REQUIRES DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN CASH

RESERVES WITH A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF RESERVE BALANCES

DEPOSITED BY THE FIRMS BANK SUBSIDIARIES WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS

WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION IN 2005 AND $3.8 BILLION IN 2004.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY FEDERAL LAW PROHIBIT JPMORGAN CHASE AND CERTAIN OTHER AFFILIATES FROM

BORROWING FROM BANKING SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE LOANS ARE SECURED IN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. SUCH SECURED

LOANS TO THE FIRM OR TO OTHER AFFILIATES ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 10% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS

TOTAL CAPITAL, AS DETERMINED BY THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES; THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL SUCH

LOANS IS LIMITED TO 20% OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARYS TOTAL CAPITAL.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF JPMORGAN CHASES INCOME (ON A PARENT COMPANY-ONLY BASIS) ARE DIVIDENDS AND

INTEREST FROM JPMORGAN CHASE BANK AND THE OTHER BANKING AND NONBANKING SUBSIDIARIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE. IN ADDITION TO

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, THE FRB, THE OCC AND THE FDIC HAVE

AUTHORITY UNDER THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY ACT TO PROHIBIT OR TO LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS BY THE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPERVISE, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE BANKS OR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, IF, IN THE BANKING REGULATORS OPINION,

PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

AT JANUARY 1, 2006 AND 2005, JPMORGAN CHASES BANK SUBSIDIARIES COULD PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, $7.4

BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THEIR RELEVANT BANKING REGULATORS. DIVIDEND CAPACITY IN 2006 WILL BE

SUPPLEMENTED BY THE BANKS EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $6.4 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.1 BILLION AND $2.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SEGREGATED IN

SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SECURITIES AND FUTURES BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 24  CAPITAL

THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL: TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. TIER 1

CAPITAL INCLUDES COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, QUALIFYING PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTEREST LESS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TIER 2 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF PREFERRED STOCK NOT QUALIFYING AS TIER

1, SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS TIER 2, AND THE AGGREGATE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TOTAL REGULATORY

CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER THE RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES OF THE FRB, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS OF TIER 1 AND

TOTAL (TIER 1 PLUS TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, AS WELL AS MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS

(WHICH ARE DEFINED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ADJUSTED ONBALANCE SHEET ASSETS). FAILURE TO MEET

THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE THE FRB TO TAKE ACTION. BANK SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ARE SUBJECT

TO THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIMARY REGULATORS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND

2004, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ALL OF ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE WELL-CAPITALIZED AND MET ALL CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH WAS SUBJECT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WERE OBLIGATED UNDER A NUMBER OF

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT USED PRIMARILY FOR BANKING PURPOSES.

CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS OR ESCALATION CLAUSES PROVIDING FOR INCREASED RENTAL

PAYMENTS BASED UPON MAINTENANCE, UTILITY AND TAX INCREASES OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PERFORM

RESTORATION WORK ON LEASED PREMISES. NO LEASE AGREEMENT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRMS ABILITY

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

LITIGATION RESERVE

THE FIRM MAINTAINS LITIGATION RESERVES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS LITIGATIONS, INCLUDING ITS MATERIAL LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, IN LIGHT

OF ALL INFORMATION KNOWN TO IT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THAT THE FIRMS LITIGATION RESERVES WERE

ADEQUATE AT SUCH DATE. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS LITIGATION RESERVES

PERIODICALLY, AND THE RESERVES MAY BE

INCREASED OR DECREASED IN THE FUTURE TO REFLECT FURTHER LITIGATION DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRM BELIEVES

IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN ITS CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING LITIGATION

AND, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LITIGATION, INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY, LITIGATING

OR SETTLING CASES ACCORDING TO MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

STOCKHOLDERS.

NOTE 26  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ENABLE END USERS TO INCREASE, REDUCE OR ALTER EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR

MARKET RISKS. THE VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE IS DERIVED FROM ITS REFERENCE TO AN UNDERLYING VARIABLE OR

COMBINATION OF VARIABLES SUCH AS EQUITY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, CREDIT, COMMODITY OR INTEREST RATE

PRICES OR INDICES. JPMORGAN CHASE MAKES MARKETS IN DERIVATIVES FOR CUSTOMERS AND ALSO IS AN

END-USER OF DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE FIRMS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS.

SFAS 133, AS AMENDED BY SFAS 138 AND SFAS 149, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE USED FOR TRADING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS. ALL FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED FOR

HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE

ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE CONTRACT IS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES OR HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS

DERIVATIVES ARE ENTERED INTO FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE FIRM ALSO USES DERIVATIVES AS AN END USER TO

HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES, MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RELATED BALANCE SHEET

INSTRUMENTS OR MEET LONGER-TERM INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. BOTH TRADING AND END-USER DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 3 ON PAGE 94

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, A DERIVATIVE MUST BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. EACH DERIVATIVE MUST BE DESIGNATED AS

A HEDGE, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION

OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, THE HEDGED ITEM AND THE RISK EXPOSURE, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS TO BE

ASSESSED PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS EFFECTIVE

AT ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS MUST BE ASSESSED AT LEAST QUARTERLY.

ANY INEFFECTIVENESS MUST BE REPORTED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS.

FOR QUALIFYING FAIR VALUE HEDGES, ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ITEM FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP

IS TERMINATED, THEN THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO THE HEDGED ITEM CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED AS PART

OF THE BASIS OF THE ITEM AND IS AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A YIELD ADJUSTMENT. FOR QUALIFYING CASH

FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE IS RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT

EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IF

THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS TERMINATED, THEN THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CASH FLOWS THAT WERE HEDGED OCCUR, CONSISTENT

WITH THE ORIGINAL HEDGE STRATEGY. FOR HEDGE

RELATIONSHIPS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACCORDING TO

THE ORIGINAL STRATEGY, ANY RELATED DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE

IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR QUALIFYING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE DERIVATIVE OR THE REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENT ARE

RECORDED IN THE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

JPMORGAN CHASES FAIR VALUE HEDGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE LONG-TERM DEBT, LOANS,

AFS SECURITIES AND MSRS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACT USED

TO MODIFY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, CONVERTING FIXED-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A

FLOATING RATE. INTEREST RATE OPTIONS, SWAPTIONS AND FORWARDS ARE ALSO USED IN COMBINATION WITH

INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIRMS MSRS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MSR

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ALL AMOUNTS HAVE

BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME, MORTGAGE FEES AND RELATED INCOME, AND OTHER INCOME. THE FIRM DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY

GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2005 ON FIRM COMMITMENTS THAT NO LONGER QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

JPMORGAN CHASE ALSO ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS

FROM FLOATING-RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY THE ROLLOVER OF

SHORT-TERM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE THE MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS USED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT

OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON FUTURE EARNINGS. ALL AMOUNTS AFFECTING

EARNINGS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEDGED ITEM, PRIMARILY NET

INTEREST INCOME.

THE FIRM USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS

TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE PORTION

OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS (FORWARD POINTS) IS

RECORDED IN NET INTEREST INCOME.

OF TIME OVER WHICH FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS ARE HEDGED IS 10 YEARS, AND SUCH TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY

RELATE TO CORE LENDING AND BORROWING ACTIVITIES.

JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SEEK TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO ALL OF THE FIRMS ECONOMIC HEDGES. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO STANDARD CREDIT DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE THE

CREDIT RISK OF LOANS AND COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUALIFYING SUCH CONTRACTS AS

HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133. SIMILARLY, THE FIRM DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE

DERIVATIVES USED AS ECONOMIC HEDGES.

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHOUT A DEFAULT OCCURRING OR WITHOUT BEING DRAWN. AS A RESULT, THE TOTAL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT, IN THE FIRMS VIEW, REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS ACTUAL

FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

CONSUMER FINANCINGS, ARE CANCELABLE, UPON NOTICE, AT THE OPTION OF THE FIRM.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE RISK OF LOSS INHERENT IN WHOLESALE-RELATED CONTRACTS, AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS MAINTAINED. SEE NOTE 12 ON PAGES 107108 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LENDING-RELATED

FIN 45 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, REQUIRING THAT A

GUARANTOR RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING

THE GUARANTEE. FIN 45 DEFINES A GUARANTEE AS A CONTRACT THAT CONTINGENTLY REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY

A GUARANTEED PARTY, BASED UPON: (A) CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING ASSET, LIABILITY OR EQUITY SECURITY OF

THE GUARANTEED PARTY; OR (B) A THIRD PARTYS FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER A SPECIFIED AGREEMENT. THE

FIRM CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING ARRANGEMENTS TO BE GUARANTEES UNDER FIN 45.

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SECURITIES

LENDING INDEMNIFICATIONS, CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN THIRD-PARTY

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE DESCRIBED IN

FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.

THE FAIR VALUE AT INCEPTION OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN WHEN ISSUING THE GUARANTEES AND

COMMITMENTS THAT QUALIFY UNDER FIN 45 IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE

AMOUNT OF PREMIUM RECEIVABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE FIRM HAS RECORDED THIS AMOUNT IN OTHER

LIABILITIES WITH AN OFFSETTING ENTRY RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. AS CASH IS RECEIVED UNDER THE

CONTRACT, IT IS APPLIED TO THE PREMIUM RECEIVABLE RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY RECORDED AT INCEPTION IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS LENDING & DEPOSIT RELATED FEES OVER

THE LIFE OF THE GUARANTEE CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO FIN 45 GUARANTEES

RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, EXCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DISCUSSED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $313

MILLION AND $341 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE AGREEMENTS TO LEND ONLY WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS COMPLIED WITH

PREDETERMINED CONDITIONS, AND THEY GENERALLY EXPIRE ON FIXED DATES.

THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES AS DEFINED IN FIN 45, EXCEPT FOR

CERTAIN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE PRINCIPALLY USED AS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO

SPES, PRIMARILY MULTI-SELLER CONDUITS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 111113 OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT. SOME OF THESE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS CAN BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME BY THE SPES

ADMINISTRATOR, WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE A TRIGGERING EVENT TO OCCUR. TRIGGERING EVENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE

NOT LIMITED TO, A NEED FOR LIQUIDITY, A MARKET VALUE DECLINE OF THE ASSETS OR A DOWNGRADE IN THE

RATING OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK. THESE AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE AN ASSET FROM THE

SPE AT AN AMOUNT ABOVE THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE, IN EFFECT PROVIDING A GUARANTEE OF THE INITIAL VALUE

OF THE REFERENCE ASSET AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT. IN MOST INSTANCES, THIRD-PARTY CREDIT

ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SPE MITIGATE THE FIRMS POTENTIAL LOSSES ON THESE AGREEMENTS.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES ARE CONDITIONAL LENDING COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY

JPMORGAN CHASE TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY UNDER CERTAIN

ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITIES, BOND FINANCINGS, ACQUISITION FINANCINGS, TRADE

AND SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 58% OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS MATURE WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE

FIRM TYPICALLY HAS RECOURSE TO RECOVER FROM THE CUSTOMER ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THESE GUARANTEES;

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY HOLD CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL TO SUPPORT THESE GUARANTEES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE FIRM HELD COLLATERAL RELATING TO $9.0 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

124

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

THE FIRM HOLDS CUSTOMERS SECURITIES UNDER CUSTODIAL ARRANGEMENTS. AT TIMES, THESE SECURITIES

ARE LOANED TO THIRD PARTIES, AND THE FIRM ISSUES SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS TO

THE CUSTOMER THAT PROTECT THE CUSTOMER AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSS IF THE THIRD PARTY FAILS TO RETURN

THE SECURITIES. TO SUPPORT THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM OBTAINS FROM THE THIRD PARTY

CASH OR OTHER HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL WITH A MARKET VALUE EXCEEDING 100% OF THE VALUE OF THE

LOANED SECURITIES. IF THE THIRD-PARTY BORROWER FAILS TO RETURN THE SECURITIES, THE FIRM WOULD USE

THE COLLATERAL TO PURCHASE THE SECURITIES IN THE MARKET AND WOULD BE EXPOSED IF THE VALUE OF THE

COLLATERAL FELL BELOW 100%. THE FIRM INVESTS THIRD-PARTY CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED IN SUPPORT OF THE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS. IN A FEW CASES WHERE THE CASH COLLATERAL IS INVESTED IN RESALE

AGREEMENTS, THE FIRM INDEMNIFIES THE THIRD PARTY AGAINST REINVESTMENT RISK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, THE FIRM HELD $245.0 BILLION AND $221.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN COLLATERAL IN SUPPORT

OF SECURITIES LENDING INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS. BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT

EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE FIRM MAY ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THEM IN THE EVENT OF

A CHANGE IN TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CONTRACT MAY

ALSO INCLUDE A TERMINATION CLAUSE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE FIRM TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT AT ITS FAIR

VALUE; THUS, SUCH A CLAUSE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE A PAYMENT UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TERMINATION CLAUSE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT SUCH INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN

CHASE. THE FIRM MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES WHEN IT SELLS A BUSINESS OR ASSETS TO A

THIRD PARTY, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INDEMNIFIES THAT THIRD PARTY FOR LOSSES IT MAY INCUR DUE TO

ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FIRM PRIOR TO THE SALE. SEE BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE FIRMS

LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE

INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAW

AND FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. HOWEVER, BASED UPON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

AS PART OF THE FIRMS LOAN SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13 ON PAGES 108111 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE FIRM PROVIDES REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT CERTAIN SECURITIZED LOANS

MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRM MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE THE LOANS AND/OR INDEMNIFY THE

PURCHASER OF THE LOANS AGAINST LOSSES DUE TO ANY BREACHES OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.

GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS THE FIRM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER SUCH

REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS HELD BY

SUCH SECURITIZATION-RELATED SPES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, PLUS, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCRUED

AND UNPAID INTEREST ON SUCH LOANS AND CERTAIN EXPENSES. THE POTENTIAL LOSS DUE TO SUCH REPURCHASE

AND/OR INDEMNITY IS MITIGATED BY THE DUE DILIGENCE THE FIRM PERFORMS BEFORE THE SALE TO ENSURE THAT

THE ASSETS COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED ON SUCH

REPURCHASES AND/OR INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT, AND THEREFORE MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE

RISK OF MATERIAL LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

THE FIRM IS A PARTNER WITH ONE OF THE LEADING COMPANIES IN ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES IN A JOINT

VENTURE OPERATING UNDER THE NAME OF CHASE PAYMENTECH SOLUTIONS, LLC (THE JOINT VENTURE). THE

JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 2005 AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT TO INTEGRATE THE FIRMS

JOINTLY-OWNED CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES (CMS) AND PAYMENTECH MERCHANT BUSINESSES, THE LATTER OF

WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. THE JOINT VENTURE PROVIDES MERCHANT PROCESSING

SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE JOINT VENTURE IS LIABLE CONTINGENTLY FOR PROCESSED

CREDIT CARD SALES TRANSACTIONS IN THE EVENT

OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT. IF A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED IN THE CARDMEMBERS

FAVOR, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL CREDIT OR REFUND THE AMOUNT TO THE CARDMEMBER AND CHARGE BACK THE

TRANSACTION TO THE MERCHANT. IF THE JOINT VENTURE IS UNABLE TO COLLECT THE AMOUNT FROM THE

MERCHANT, THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BEAR THE LOSS FOR THE AMOUNT CREDITED OR REFUNDED TO THE

CARDMEMBER. THE JOINT VENTURE MITIGATES THIS RISK BY WITHHOLDING SETTLEMENT, OR BY OBTAINING ESCROW

DEPOSITS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM CERTAIN MERCHANTS. HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT: 1) A

MERCHANT CEASES OPERATIONS AND IS UNABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR A REFUND; 2) THE JOINT

VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL FROM THE MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS; AND 3)

THE JOINT VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER REFUNDS, THE

FIRM WOULD BE LIABLE TO REFUND THE CARDHOLDER IN PROPORTION TO ITS APPROXIMATE EQUITY INTEREST IN

THE JOINT VENTURE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE JOINT VENTURE, ALONG WITH THE

INTEGRATED BUSINESSES OF CMS AND PAYMENTECH, INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $11 MILLION ON

$563 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, OF WHICH THE FIRM SHARED LIABILITY ONLY ON $200 BILLION

OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE JOINT VENTURE HELD $909 MILLION OF

COLLATERAL. IN 2004, THE CMS AND PAYMENTECH VENTURES INCURRED AGGREGATE CREDIT LOSSES OF $7.1

MILLION ON $396 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED, OF WHICH THE FIRM SHARED LIABILITY ONLY ON

$205 BILLION OF AGGREGATE VOLUME PROCESSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CMS AND PAYMENTECH VENTURES

HELD $620 MILLION OF COLLATERAL. THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE JOINT VENTURE, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE WOULD NOT BE DIFFERENT

MATERIALLY FROM THE CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE; THEREFORE, THE FIRM HAS

NOT RECORDED ANY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE RECORDED BY THE JOINT VENTURE.

THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL SECURITIES AND FUTURES EXCHANGES AND CLEARING-HOUSES BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS. MEMBERSHIP IN SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRES THE FIRM TO PAY A

PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ORGANIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANOTHER

MEMBER. SUCH OBLIGATION VARIES WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. IT MAY BE LIMITED TO MEMBERS WHO DEALT

WITH THE DEFAULTING MEMBER OR TO THE AMOUNT (OR A MULTIPLE OF THE AMOUNT) OF THE FIRMS

CONTRIBUTION TO A MEMBERS GUARANTY FUND, OR, IN A FEW CASES, IT MAY BE UNLIMITED. IT IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE FIRMS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE

AN ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THE FIRM THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED.

HOWEVER, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE RISK OF LOSS TO BE REMOTE.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE ARE CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE

FIRM IS A COUNTERPARTY THAT MEET THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GUARANTEE UNDER FIN 45. THESE DERIVATIVES

ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE WRITTEN PUT

OPTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE FIRM TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM THE OPTION HOLDER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE BY A

SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVES THAT EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE RETURN ON A

COUNTERPARTYS REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES THAT THE

FIRM DEEMS TO BE GUARANTEES WAS $62 BILLION AND $53 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRM REDUCES EXPOSURES TO THESE CONTRACTS BY ENTERING INTO OFFSETTING

TRANSACTIONS OR BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT HEDGE THE MARKET RISK RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS.

THE FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS WAS A DERIVATIVE RECEIVABLE OF $198 MILLION AND $180

MILLION, AND A DERIVATIVE PAYABLE OF $767 MILLION AND $622 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. FINALLY, CERTAIN WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS AND CREDIT DERIVATIVES PERMIT CASH SETTLEMENT

AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPTION HOLDER OR THE BUYER OF CREDIT PROTECTION TO OWN THE REFERENCE ASSET.

THE FIRM DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE CONTRACTS TO BE GUARANTEES AS DESCRIBED IN FIN 45.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 28  CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES

THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE CREDIT RISK PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL

CONCENTRATION RISKS AND TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL WHEN DEEMED NECESSARY. IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE

PORTFOLIO, RISK CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRY AND BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN THE

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATIONS ARE EVALUATED PRIMARILY BY PRODUCT AND BY U.S. GEOGRAPHIC

REGION.

THE FIRM DOES NOT BELIEVE EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE LOAN PRODUCT WITH VARYING TERMS (E.G., INTEREST-ONLY

PAYMENTS FOR AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD) OR EXPOSURE TO LOANS WITH HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS WOULD

RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION

OF CREDIT RISK. TERMS OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL COVERAGE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FIRMS

ASSESSMENT WHEN EXTENDING CREDIT AND ESTABLISHING ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NOTE 29  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE

EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES, OTHER THAN IN A FORCED OR LIQUIDATION

SALE.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY MAY DIFFER BASED UPON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT AND/OR ITS

USE IN A TRADING OR INVESTING STRATEGY. GENERALLY, THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME;



AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED EACH PERIOD

IN A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND AS PART OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME;



AT COST (LESS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS), WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE NOT RECORDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES THERETO; OR



AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE.

THE FIRM HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE,

FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENT

INFORMATION AS INPUTS TO THE VALUATION MODEL. VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUIDITY AND CONCENTRATION CONCERNS AND ARE BASED UPON DEFINED

METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME.



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE MARKET PRICE (OR PARAMETER) IS NOT INDICATIVE

OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY. AS FEW DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE LISTED ON AN EXCHANGE,

THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR

BASIS OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. MARKET PRACTICE IS TO QUOTE PARAMETERS EQUIVALENT TO A AA

CREDIT RATING; THUS, ALL COUNTERPARTIES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE THE SAME CREDIT QUALITY. AN ADJUSTMENT

IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF EACH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY AND TO ARRIVE

AT FAIR VALUE. WITHOUT THIS ADJUSTMENT, DERIVATIVE POSITIONS WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATELY VALUED.

126

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT



LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBSERVE A RECENT MARKET

PRICE FOR A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT TRADES IN INACTIVE (OR LESS ACTIVE) MARKETS. THUS, VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS FOR RISK OF LOSS DUE TO A LACK OF LIQUIDITY ARE APPLIED TO THOSE POSITIONS TO ARRIVE AT

FAIR VALUE. THE FIRM TRIES TO ASCERTAIN THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL VALUATION BASED

UPON THE LIQUIDITY OR ILLIQUIDITY, AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INSTRUMENT TRADES

AND MAKES LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FIRM MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY

ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST RELEVANT PRICING

POINT; (2) WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACTUAL TRADE OR RELEVANT EXTERNAL QUOTE; AND (3) THE VOLATILITY OF

THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



CONCENTRATION VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE COST OF UNWINDING

LARGER-THAN-NORMAL MARKET-SIZE RISK POSITIONS. THE COST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE SIZE OF THE

ADVERSE MARKET MOVE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD REQUIRED TO BRING A POSITION

DOWN TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL. AN ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD NEEDED TO REDUCE, WITHOUT MARKET

DISRUPTION, A POSITION TO A NONCONCENTRATED LEVEL IS GENERALLY BASED UPON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE

POSITION TO THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME OF THAT POSITION. WITHOUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS, LARGER

POSITIONS WOULD BE VALUED AT A PRICE GREATER THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH THE FIRM COULD EXIT THE

POSITIONS.

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED UPON ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND ARE CONTROLLED BY A PRICE

VERIFICATION GROUP INDEPENDENT OF THE RISK-TAKING FUNCTION. ECONOMIC SUBSTANTIATION OF MODELS,

PRICES, MARKET INPUTS AND REVENUE THROUGH PRICE/INPUT TESTING, AS WELL AS BACKTESTING, IS DONE TO

VALIDATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY. ANY CHANGES TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY

ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED.

THE METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE CALCULATION THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF DIFFERENT

METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A

DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL NONFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF SFAS

107. ACCORDINGLY, THE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 107 PROVIDE ONLY A PARTIAL ESTIMATE

OF THE FAIR VALUE OF JPMORGAN CHASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM HAS DEVELOPED LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS

WITH ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS DEPOSIT BASE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CORE

DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES AND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIPS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THESE ITEMS, IN

THE AGGREGATE, ADD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO JPMORGAN CHASE, BUT THEIR FAIR VALUE IS NOT DISCLOSED IN

THIS NOTE.

THE FOLLOWING ITEMS DESCRIBE THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED, BY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE.

FINANCIAL ASSETS

ASSETS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

THE FIRM CONSIDERS FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS CARRIED AT COST  INCLUDING CASH AND

DUE FROM BANKS, DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES BORROWED, SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLES AND ACCRUED

INTEREST RECEIVABLE  TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES, DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM

NATURE AND GENERALLY NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK.

ASSETS WHERE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS FROM COST

THE FIRMS DEBT, EQUITY AND DERIVATIVE TRADING INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE. QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHEN AVAILABLE, ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADING

INSTRUMENTS. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING

PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, OR DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS.

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER RESALE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED RESALE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR

PRODUCTS WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, CASH FLOWS

ARE DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

SECURITIES

FAIR VALUES OF ACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE SECONDARY MARKET, WHILE THE FAIR

VALUES FOR NONACTIVELY TRADED SECURITIES ARE BASED UPON INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

DERIVATIVES

FAIR VALUE FOR DERIVATIVES IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING.



POSITION VALUATION, PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON LIQUID MARKET PRICING AS EVIDENCED BY EXCHANGE-TRADED

PRICES, BROKER-DEALER QUOTATIONS OR RELATED INPUT PARAMETERS, WHICH ASSUME ALL COUNTERPARTIES HAVE

THE SAME CREDIT RATING;



CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESULTING PORTFOLIO VALUATION, TO REFLECT THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES; AND



OTHER FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION LIQUIDITY, CONCENTRATION AND OTHER

FACTORS.

FOR THOSE DERIVATIVES VALUED BASED UPON MODELS WITH SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS, THE

FIRM DEFERS THE INITIAL TRADING PROFIT FOR THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE DEFERRED PROFIT IS

RECOGNIZED IN TRADING REVENUE ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS (TYPICALLY STRAIGHT-LINE AMORTIZATION OVER THE

LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS) AND WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE PAYABLES DOES NOT INCORPORATE A VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT

JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES

THE FAIR VALUE OF VARIABLE-RATE INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING AMOUNTS DUE TO THEIR VARIABLE INTEREST TERMS AND NEGLIGIBLE CREDIT RISK. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES FOR FIXED-RATE INTERESTS IN PURCHASED RECEIVABLES ARE DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

LOANS

FAIR VALUE FOR LOANS IS DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES SUITABLE FOR EACH TYPE OF LOAN.



FAIR VALUE FOR THE WHOLESALE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY, USING THE COST OF CREDIT

DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, UPON

WHICH THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS.



FAIR VALUES FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS (INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE FINANCINGS) AND CONSUMER REAL

ESTATE, FOR WHICH MARKET RATES FOR COMPARABLE LOANS ARE READILY AVAILABLE, ARE BASED UPON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR PREPAYMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR CONSUMER INSTALLMENT

LOANS ARE CURRENT RATES OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS. FOR CONSUMER REAL ESTATE, SECONDARY MARKET

YIELDS FOR COMPARABLE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ADJUSTED FOR RISK, ARE USED.



FAIR VALUE FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES IS BASED UPON DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNT

RATES USED FOR CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES INCORPORATE ONLY THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, SINCE

THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ALREADY REFLECT AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CREDIT RISK.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.



THE FAIR VALUE OF LOANS IN THE HELD-FOR-SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS IS GENERALLY BASED UPON

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND UPON PRICES OF SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BONDS, CREDIT

DERIVATIVES AND LOANS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. IF MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE

FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS ADJUSTED FOR CREDIT RISK; THAT RISK IS

DISCOUNTED, USING A RATE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH MATURITY THAT INCORPORATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES.

OTHER ASSETS

COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. FOR THE MAJORITY OF

COMMODITIES INVENTORY, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO

PRICES IN HIGHLY ACTIVE AND

LIQUID MARKETS. THE FAIR VALUE FOR OTHER COMMODITIES INVENTORY IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING

PRICING AND OTHER DATA DERIVED FROM LESS LIQUID AND DEVELOPING MARKETS WHERE THE UNDERLYING

COMMODITIES ARE TRADED. THIS CAPTION ALSO INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MSRS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTE 9 ON PAGE 105 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY FOR MSRS, SEE NOTE 15 ON PAGES 114116 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE

SFAS 107 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR DEPOSIT LIABILITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY (I.E.,

DEMAND, SAVINGS AND CERTAIN MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS) BE EQUAL TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE. SFAS 107 DOES

NOT ALLOW FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE INHERENT FUNDING VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, OTHER BORROWED FUNDS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS

CONSIDERED TO APPROXIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS ARE ESTIMATED BY DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS BASED UPON THE

REMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF FUNDS HAVING SIMILAR INTEREST RATES AND SIMILAR MATURITIES.

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SHORT-TERM IN

NATURE; AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES CARRYING

VALUE. THIS BALANCE SHEET ITEM ALSO INCLUDES STRUCTURED REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS

WITH LONG-DATED MATURITIES. TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, THE CASH FLOWS ARE

DISCOUNTED USING THE APPROPRIATE MARKET RATES FOR THE APPLICABLE MATURITY.

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS ISSUED BY CONSOLIDATED VIES (BENEFICIAL INTERESTS) ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM

IN NATURE AND, AS SUCH, FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS TRANSACTIONS, COST APPROXIMATES

CARRYING VALUE. THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ALSO INCLUDE BENEFICIAL INTERESTS WITH LONG-DATED

MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET RATES.

LONG-TERM DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES

HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED GUARANTEED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES, IS BASED UPON CURRENT MARKET RATES

AND IS ADJUSTED FOR JPMORGAN CHASES CREDIT QUALITY.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LIQUID SECONDARY MARKET FOR WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS, THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR

VALUE OF ITS WHOLESALE LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS PRIMARILY USING THE COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES

(WHICH IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RECOVERY RATES BETWEEN BONDS, UPON WHICH THE

COST OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES IS BASED, AND LOANS) AND LOAN EQUIVALENTS (WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION

OF AN UNUSED COMMITMENT EXPECTED, BASED UPON THE FIRMS AVERAGE PORTFOLIO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TO

BECOME OUTSTANDING IN THE EVENT AN OBLIGOR DEFAULTS). THE FIRM ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

CONSUMER COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BASED UPON THE PRIMARY MARKET PRICES TO ORIGINATE NEW

COMMITMENTS. IT IS THE CHANGE IN CURRENT PRIMARY MARKET PRICES THAT PROVIDES THE ESTIMATE OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS BASIS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

THE FIRMS LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS WAS A LIABILITY OF $0.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $0.1 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES VALUED UNDER SFAS 107; ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT

CONSIDERED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. / 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

NOTE 30  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION OF JPMORGAN CHASE BY MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC

AREA. THE FIRM DEFINES INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES AS BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE CUSTOMERS

RESIDING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW IS BASED PRIMARILY UPON

THE DOMICILE OF THE CUSTOMER. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE FIRMS U.S. OPERATIONS SERVE INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESSES.

AS THE FIRMS OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED, ESTIMATES AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN

MADE TO APPORTION REVENUE AND EXPENSE BETWEEN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ALLOCATIONS USED FOR THE FIRMS SEGMENT REPORTING AS SET

FORTH IN NOTE 31 ON PAGES 130-131 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

THE FIRMS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE

SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO TOTAL ASSETS. THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRMS LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE LOCATED

IN THE UNITED STATES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NOTE 31  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JPMORGAN CHASE IS ORGANIZED INTO SIX MAJOR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS (THE INVESTMENT BANK,

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES, CARD SERVICES, COMMERCIAL BANKING, TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES AND

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT), AS WELL AS A CORPORATE SEGMENT. THE SEGMENTS ARE BASED UPON THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED OR THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVED, AND THEY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE

PRESENTED ON AN OPERATING BASIS. FOR A DEFINITION OF OPERATING BASIS, SEE THE FOOTNOTES TO THE

TABLE BELOW. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION CONCERNING JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE BUSINESS

SEGMENT RESULTS ON PAGES 34-35 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING WAS

REALIGNED TO REFLECT THE NEW BUSINESS STRUCTURE OF THE COMBINED FIRM. TREASURY WAS TRANSFERRED FROM

THE INVESTMENT BANK INTO CORPORATE. THE SEGMENT FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD BEEN

COMPRISED OF CHASE HOME FINANCE, CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES, CHASE AUTO FINANCE, CHASE REGIONAL

BANKING AND CHASE MIDDLE MARKET; AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS SEGMENT IS NOW CALLED RETAIL

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND IS COMPRISED OF HOME FINANCE, AUTO & EDUCATION FINANCE, CONSUMER & SMALL

BUSINESS BANKING AND INSURANCE. CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICES IS NOW ITS OWN SEGMENT CALLED CARD

SERVICES, AND CHASE MIDDLE MARKET MOVED INTO COMMERCIAL BANKING.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING WAS RENAMED ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT. JPMORGAN PARTNERS,

WHICH FORMERLY WAS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, WAS MOVED INTO CORPORATE. CORPORATE CURRENTLY COMPRISES PRIVATE

EQUITY (JPMORGAN PARTNERS AND ONE EQUITY PARTNERS) AND TREASURY, AND THE

IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE FIRMS RESULTS ON A REPORTED BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS ON AN OPERATING BASIS, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THE

DEFINITION OF OPERATING BASIS STARTS WITH THE REPORTED U.S. GAAP RESULTS. IN THE CASE OF THE

INVESTMENT BANK, OPERATING BASIS NONINTEREST REVENUE INCLUDES, IN TRADING REVENUE, NET INTEREST

INCOME (NII) RELATED TO TRADING ACTIVITIES. IN THE CASE OF CARD SERVICES, REFER TO FOOTNOTE (E).

THESE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT CHANGE JPMORGAN CHASES REPORTED NET INCOME. OPERATING BASIS ALSO EXCLUDES

MERGER COSTS, NONOPERATING LITIGATION RESERVE CHARGES AND ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS,

AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE ITEMS ARE NOT PART OF THE FIRMS NORMAL DAILY BUSINESS OPERATIONS

(AND, THEREFORE, NOT INDICATIVE OF TRENDS) AND DO NOT PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS WITH OTHER

PERIODS. FINALLY, OPERATING RESULTS REFLECT REVENUES (NONINTEREST REVENUE AND NII) ON A

TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. REFER TO FOOTNOTE (F) FOR THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS.

(B)

2004 RESULTS INCLUDE SIX MONTHS OF THE COMBINED FIRMS RESULTS AND SIX MONTHS OF HERITAGE

JPMORGAN CHASE RESULTS. 2003 REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF HERITAGE JPMORGAN CHASE ONLY.

(C)

TSS REIMBURSES THE IB FOR CREDIT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES THE IB MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS THE

SEGMENTS SHARE. AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY WAS REVISED TO BE BASED

UPON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, NET OF THE COST OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THOSE EXPOSURES. PRIOR TO THE MERGER,

THE CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WAS BASED UPON PRE-TAX EARNINGS, PLUS THE ALLOCATED CAPITAL ASSOCIATED

WITH THE SHARED CLIENTS.

(D)

SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE RECLASSIFICATION OF NII RELATED

TO TRADING ACTIVITIES TO TRADING REVENUE WITHIN NONINTEREST REVENUE, WHICH IMPACTS PRIMARILY THE

INVESTMENT BANK. TRADING-RELATED NII RECLASSIFIED TO TRADING REVENUE WAS $159 MILLION, $2.0 BILLION

AND $2.1 BILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED IN

CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT NII AND NONINTEREST REVENUE ON A REPORTED GAAP BASIS FOR

JPMORGAN CHASE.

(E)

OPERATING RESULTS FOR CARD SERVICES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS ON

REVENUE, PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND AVERAGE ASSETS, AS JPMORGAN CHASE TREATS THE SOLD

RECEIVABLES AS IF THEY WERE STILL ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN EVALUATING THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ELIMINATED IN CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT

THE FIRMS REPORTED GAAP RESULTS. THE RELATED SECURITIZATION ADJUSTMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2006, TSS WILL REPORT RESULTS FOR TWO DIVISIONS: TS AND WSS. WSS WAS FORMED BY

CONSOLIDATING IS AND ITS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE FIRMS SEGMENT RESULTS FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003 ON AN

OPERATING BASIS. THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS, MERGER COSTS, NONOPERATING LITIGATION

RESERVE CHARGES AND ACCOUNTING POLICY CONFORMITY ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

CORPORATE/RECONCILING ITEMS SO THAT THE TOTAL FIRM RESULTS ARE ON A REPORTED BASIS. FINALLY,

COMMENCING WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, OPERATING REVENUE (NONINTEREST REVENUE AND NET INTEREST

INCOME) FOR EACH OF THE SEGMENTS AND THE FIRM IS PRESENTED ON A TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCORDINGLY,

REVENUE FROM TAX EXEMPT SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT RECEIVE TAX CREDITS ARE PRESENTED IN THE

OPERATING RESULTS ON A BASIS COMPARABLE TO TAXABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS

MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS THE COMPARABILITY OF REVENUES ARISING FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT

SOURCES. THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IS RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX

EXPENSE. THE CORPORATE SECTORS AND THE FIRMS OPERATING REVENUE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO BE PRESENTED SIMILARLY ON A

TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS. THIS RESTATEMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON THE CORPORATE SECTORS OR THE FIRMS

OPERATING EARNINGS. SEGMENT RESULTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO JULY 1, 2004, REFLECT HERITAGE JPMORGAN

CHASE-ONLY RESULTS AND HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT BUSINESS SEGMENT ORGANIZATION AND

REPORTING CLASSIFICATIONS.

MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ORALLY TO ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MEDIA AND

OTHERS.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. JPMORGAN

CHASES ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN ITS FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THIS DIFFERENCEMANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE FIRMS

CONTROLINCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: LOCAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC

INSTITUTED BY THE FIRM AND BY OTHER ENTITIES WHICH MAY AFFECT

THE FIRMS BUSINESS; MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRMS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE

ACQUISITIONS; ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AND THE ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE; ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO CONTROL

EXPENSES; COMPETITIVE PRESSURES; CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

ACCOUNTING POLICIES; COSTS, OUTCOMES AND EFFECTS OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS;

CHANGES IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS; AND ADEQUACY OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS IN THE FIRMS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, TO WHICH REFERENCE IS

HEREBY MADE. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY LIST OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OR RISK FACTORS IS COMPLETE.

ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE FIRM SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE

MADE AND JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE

IMPACT OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT ARISE AFTER THE DATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WAS MADE.

THE READER SHOULD, HOWEVER, CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES OF A FORWARD-LOOKING NATURE THE FIRM

MAY MAKE IN ANY SUBSEQUENT ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ITS

CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.

SECURITIES WITH NO STATED MATURITY ARE INCLUDED WITH SECURITIES WITH A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY

OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF JPMORGAN CHASES MORTGAGED-BACKED SECURITIES (MBSS) AND

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) ARE DUE IN 10 YEARS OR MORE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL

MATURITY. THE ESTIMATED DURATION, WHICH REFLECTS ANTICIPATED FUTURE PREPAYMENTS BASED ON A

CONSENSUS OF DEALERS IN THE MARKET, IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS FOR MBSS AND CMOS.

(B)

THE AVERAGE YIELD WAS BASED ON AMORTIZED COST BALANCES AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AND DOES NOT

GIVE EFFECT TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

YIELDS ARE DERIVED BY DIVIDING INTEREST INCOME (INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF RELATED DERIVATIVES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS) BY TOTAL

AMORTIZED COST. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELDS ARE USED WHERE APPLICABLE.

(C)

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS OF STATE AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, CMOS OF PRIVATE ISSUERS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

(D)

FOR THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES OF SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, SEE NOTE 9

ON PAGE 103. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY

OBLIGATIONS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS WAS $45,690 MILLION, AND OTHER

AVAILABLE-FOR-SECURITIES WAS $14,732 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE AMORTIZED COST OF U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS

HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WAS $176 MILLION. THERE WERE NO OTHER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES WERE THE ONLY ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES

EXCEEDED 10% OF JPMORGAN CHASES TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER

31, 2005.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS EXCEED

0.75% OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF ANY OF THE DATES

SPECIFIED. THE DISCLOSURE INCLUDES CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND SEC

METHODOLOGIES RELATE TO THE TREATMENTS OF LOCAL COUNTRY EXPOSURE AND TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

DERIVATIVES.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JPMORGAN CHASES CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS VIEW

OF THIS EXPOSURE, SEE COUNTRY EXPOSURE ON PAGE 70.
