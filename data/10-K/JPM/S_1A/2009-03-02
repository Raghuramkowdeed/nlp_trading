ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 115.

HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR

ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER REPORTS THAT WE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT US. YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL

POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT US.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE

LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CORPORATE OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;

INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,

ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR

EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES. THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACTIVITY

LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR

INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES;

THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM OUR PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES; THE

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE WE RECEIVE

FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS WE MANAGE ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS;

AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR

UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY US.

WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS AND WE MAY HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING POSITIONS IN

SECURITIES IN MARKETS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM

MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT

STANDING; OUR SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND

COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS; AND OTHER

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REVENUE RELATING TO OUR TRADING AND PRINCIPAL

INVESTMENT BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT PRICING OR OUR

ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

EARNINGS.

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING

MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS WE MANAGE OR HOLD IN CUSTODY, WHICH,

IN TURN, COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT WE RECEIVE.

OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS

INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

THE DETERIORATION OF THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN

DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

DURING 2008, U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF LIQUIDITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL

SECTOR,

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, REDUCED BUSINESS ACTIVITY, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, DECLINING HOME

PRICES, AND EROSION OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WHEN SUCH

CONDITIONS WILL AMELIORATE.

IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. SOME

POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE

MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER

ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN

OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER

CONFIDENCE IN US OR OUR PROSPECTS.

THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE LIQUIDITY

CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR

TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS. IF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE, OUR LIQUIDITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ACCESS TO

LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING TO LEND TO US,

THEREBY CURTAILING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS

OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT COULD ALSO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO US

BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING. CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING

HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG

CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY

MONITORING PROCEDURES.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES)

OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS AND

MARKET-DRIVEN, AND INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. AS SUCH, OUR CREDIT

SPREADS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE RELY ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR OUR CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE

FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE SOUNDNESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES AND LENDING COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO MANY DIFFERENT

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

PRODUCTS

AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

OUR EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS. WE ESTIMATE AND ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR

CREDIT RISKS AND POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THIS PROCESS, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION,

REQUIRES DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW THESE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR BORROWERS TO REPAY THEIR LOANS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY

SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT WE WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR

THAT WE WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY. ANY SUCH FAILURE

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK

IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET ILLIQUIDITY, SUCH AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008. DURING SUCH PERIODS, OUR CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE

FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES

THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE EXPOSURE DUE TO US. IN

ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES IN

TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH LOSSES WOULD NOT

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS.

AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS

THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (LBHI). ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2008, LBHI FILED A

VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE (THE

BANKRUPTCY CODE) IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND

THEREAFTER SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11

OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE COURT (LBHI AND SUCH SUBSIDIARIES COLLECTIVELY, LEHMAN). ON

SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, A LIQUIDATION CASE UNDER THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT WAS COMMENCED

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR LEHMAN BROTHERS INC.

(LBI), LBHIS U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, AND THE COURT NOW PRESIDES OVER THE LBI SIPA

LIQUIDATION CASE. WE WERE LBIS CLEARING BANK AND ARE THE LARGEST SECURED CREDITOR IN THE LEHMAN

AND LBI CASES, ACCORDING TO LEHMANS SCHEDULES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US

AND/OR OUR SECURITY INTERESTS, INCLUDING BY THE LBHI CREDITORS COMMITTEE, THE SIPA TRUSTEE

APPOINTED IN THE LBI LIQUIDATION CASE, THE PRINCIPAL ACQUIROR OF LBIS ASSETS, AND OTHERS IN

CONNECTION WITH LEHMAN AND LBI CASES. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELF AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS.

AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF OUR

CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO US

WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR

REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF OUR

COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME

INDUSTRY, THEREBY EXACERBATING OUR CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES, INCLUDING

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES, WE COULD INCUR IN OUR TRADING, CLEARING, AND PROPRIETARY BUSINESSES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO

ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND ANY CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK COULD

INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN

THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO SELL,

SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS HELD BY US,

THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS

OF SUCH POSITIONS. THESE CONCENTRATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO

LOSSES IF THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS

DECLINE CAUSING US TO TAKE WRITE DOWNS. MOREOVER, THE INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS NOT ONLY

INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL

OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO US.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO US. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES

AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK,

OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG

OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT WE HAVE NOT

APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, WE

COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET

ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO

DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

OUR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT

COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT

EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME

CORRELATED MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE

DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS THAT WE DO NOW OWN; IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR

OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS

OTHERWISE DUE TO US AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND

ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MANY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT CLEARED AND

SETTLED THROUGH A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE OR EXCHANGE, AND THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE CONFIRMED OR

SETTLED BY COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THESE SITUATIONS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED

CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, WE MAY FIND THE CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT

TO ENFORCE. FURTHER, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING

THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF THE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE US TO INCUR

UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LEGAL COSTS, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

EFFECTIVELY OUR RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET

BEHAVIOR, AND ALL

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY US ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR

ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIES, CAUSING US TO INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS OUR BUSINESSES GROW AND THE MARKETS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT

PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR

MANAGED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY, POLITICAL, LEGAL

AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN

THE UNITED STATES. ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING

AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO

MATERIALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, SUCH AS DEBT SECURITIES AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). ITS POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWERS, POTENTIALLY

INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF THESE

CHANGES ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

OUR BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VARIOUS

UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR INVEST, OR IN

WHICH WE MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS,

INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER

NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND A

LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE

COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING

IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT

OF THE ABOVE

CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE

SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES. ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EMERGENCE OF A WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY OR PANDEMIC ALSO COULD CREATE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL

DISRUPTION THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATIONS OR IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

OUR BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD.

OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE IT TO SIGNIFICANT COST

AND LIABILITY.

WE ENGAGE IN POWER GENERATION, AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANK, WE ENGAGE IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES,

INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER,

EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES,

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE EXPECT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES

ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH

CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, LIABILITY MAY BE

INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR REMEDIATION

OF CONTAMINATIONS. OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSES US TO THE

RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS,

RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT

COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND

SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION

EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF

PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND

DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. WE ATTEMPT TO

MITIGATE OUR RISKS, BUT OUR ACTIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN

ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY,

FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR

INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY SUCH EVENTS.

WE RELY ON OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE

ARE SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR

OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES OUR OPERATIONS OR

SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO US,

INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF

THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN

POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN OUR POSSESSION WERE

TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF SUCH

INFORMATION WERE ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION,

EITHER BY FAULT OF OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION IS

INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISEASE PANDEMICS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR

PHYSICAL ASSETS, OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS.

SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO US.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS US, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE

RISK THAT OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE

DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING US TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT

COVERED BY INSURANCE.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY. WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL

LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE TYPE AND MANNER IN WHICH WE

DO BUSINESS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR

RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS AND SERVICES PROVIDED.

RECENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO NEW LEGISLATION AND NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR

CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION AND REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. IN RESPONSE TO SUCH MARKET AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, THE FDIC, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS,

HAVE TAKEN A

VARIETY OF EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES DESIGNED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCREASE

LIQUIDITY AND TO STRENGTHEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON OCTOBER 3, 2008 AND ON FEBRUARY

17, 2009, THE EESA AND THE ARRA, RESPECTIVELY, WERE SIGNED INTO LAW. THESE LAWS ARE

INTENDED TO PROVIDE FISCAL STIMULUS AND STABILITY TO THE U.S. ECONOMY, BY AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PERMITTING THE U.S. TREASURY TO MAKE DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PURSUANT TO THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, AS TO THE ACTUAL IMPACT THAT THESE

LAWS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM, WILL HAVE ON THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FAILURE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO STABILIZE AND A CONTINUATION OR

WORSENING OF CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CONTINUE TO MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ACCESS TO CREDIT OR THE

TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PARTICIPATION IN CURRENT OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO RECENT MARKET EVENTS

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO RESTRICTIONS AND ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT ON THE MANNER IN

WHICH WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, AND

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM, AS AMENDED BY THE ARRA, THE CONSENT OF THE U.S. TREASURY IS

REQUIRED FOR US TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASE OUR COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE LAST QUARTERLY STOCK DIVIDEND

DECLARED BY US PRIOR TO OCTOBER 14, 2008 OR, EXCEPT IN LIMITED

CIRCUMSTANCES, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER PREFERRED STOCK UNLESS THE SERIES K PREFERRED

STOCK THAT WAS ISSUED TO THE U.S. TREASURY UNDER THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN REDEEMED OR

THE U.S. TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED ALL OF THE SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK TO A THIRD PARTY. THE ARRA

ALSO IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PAY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO CERTAIN OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY REASON OF OUR PARTICIPATION

IN THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM OR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WILL NOT

HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEW

LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD CAUSE BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

REVENUE, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WE MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING

IN, IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 18, 2008, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM ADOPTED

ENHANCED REGULATIONS FOR CREDIT CARDS THROUGH AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION Z, WHICH IMPLEMENTS THE

TRUTH-IN-LENDING ACT, AND ALSO NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES

UNDER THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT. THESE REGULATORY CHANGES WILL REQUIRE US TO INVEST

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURE AND SYSTEM CHANGES,

AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS MAY BY ENACTED OR PROMULGATED IN THE FUTURE, AND WE ARE

UNABLE TO PREDICT THE FORM SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION MAY TAKE, OR THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE WOULD

NEED TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESSES OR OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION. FOR

EXAMPLE, PROPOSED LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD AMEND TO THE BANKRUPTCY

CODE TO PERMIT MODIFICATIONS OF CERTAIN MORTGAGES THAT ARE SECURED BY A CHAPTER 13 DEBTORS

PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. PROPOSED LEGISLATION HAS ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, PRESCRIBE WHEN INTEREST CAN BE CHARGED ON REVOLVING CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, PRESCRIBE

WHEN AND HOW INTEREST RATES CAN BE INCREASED, LIMIT EVENTS OF DEFAULT THAT CAN RESULT IN INTEREST

RATE INCREASES ON EXISTING BALANCES, RESTRICT THE IMPOSITION OF CERTAIN FEES, REQUIRE A SPECIFIED

CUTOFF HOUR WHEN PAYMENTS MUST BE CREDITED TO ACCOUNTS, PRESCRIBE HOW PAYMENTS MUST BE ALLOCATED TO

OUTSTANDING BALANCES ON ACCOUNTS AND RESTRICT THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT CARDS FOR PERSONS UNDER 21

YEARS OF AGE EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IF ANY SUCH

LEGISLATION WERE ENACTED THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE DO

NOT COMPLY WITH THE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR

OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR

MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT

YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS

AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. IF THIS REGULATORY TREND

CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN

ADDITION, ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION ARISING FROM THE FAILURE OR PERCEIVED

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL, REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS OR TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM

PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US.

WE ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS

ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR

PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS,

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE US SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL

HARM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR

BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WE EXPECT COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER,

BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER

ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES. CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING 2008, AS SEVERAL MAJOR U.S.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MERGED, WERE FORCED TO SELL ASSETS AND, IN SOME CASES FAILED.

WE ALSO FACE AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND

COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES

PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER

INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS

OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION,

REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT

DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE.

INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES

IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE US TO EXTEND

MORE OF OUR CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS

ANTICIPATED.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS,

INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE

INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED

ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE

COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS,

SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. INTEGRATION EFFORTS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.

GIVEN THE CONTINUED MARKET VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY, WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED

CREDIT COSTS OR NEED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS AND ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE ASSETS AND

LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER (THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER)

BY AND AMONG JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS (WASHINGTON MUTUAL) BANKING OPERATIONS (THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION) THAT COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT AS OUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS CONTINUE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, OTHER

UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO REMOVE THEIR ACCOUNTS FROM US AND MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN

THE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND

POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS,

DEPOSITORS AND EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS.

DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR ATTRACTING AND MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS,

INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO OUR

BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO OUR REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM

STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING US, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY

ALSO RESULT IN HARM TO OUR PROSPECTS.

WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG OUR CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE

TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH

US, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO US.

PART I

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE.

OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS

CURRENTLY, OR THAT MAY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, IMPOSED ON US AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE

CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM OR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND

ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, OUR PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD

CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

INCLUDING IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE

OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAKE JUDGMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS OF SPES. IF IT IS

LATER DETERMINED THAT NON-CONSOLIDATED SPES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED, THIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, RELATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL RATIOS AND, IF THE SPES

ASSETS INCLUDE UNREALIZED LOSSES, COULD REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE THOSE LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN

REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN

ORDER TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE MAY

MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY

RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE

NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, BEING BASED ON

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN

PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET

ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR

ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO DECLINES IN OUR EARNINGS.
