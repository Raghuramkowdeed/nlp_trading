ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON

PAGE 135. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER

REPORTS THAT WE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. YOU SHOULD NOT

CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD

AFFECT US.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC

AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE

LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CORPORATE OR OTHER SCANDALS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS;

INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,

ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR

EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES. THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACTIVITY

LEVELS OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR

INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES;

THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM OUR PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS BUSINESSES; THE

VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE EXECUTE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE WE RECEIVE

FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS WE MANAGE ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS;

AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR

UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY US.

WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS AND WE MAY HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME SIGNIFICANT POSITIONS, INCLUDING POSITIONS IN SECURITIES

IN MARKETS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET

VALUES OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT STANDING; OUR SUCCESS

IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING OUR MARKET AND OTHER RISKS; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT

AND COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS; AND

OTHER ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REVENUE RELATING TO OUR TRADING AND

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT

PRICING OR OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

THE FEES WE EARN FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING

MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS WE MANAGE OR HOLD IN CUSTODY, WHICH,

IN TURN, COULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET

OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT WE RECEIVE.

DURING 2008, U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND WERE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF LIQUIDITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,

DISRUPTIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, REDUCED BUSINESS ACTIVITY, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, DECLINING HOME

PRICES, AND EROSION OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009. WHILE THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT STABILIZED DURING THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

REMAINS WEAK, WHICH AFFECTS OUR BUSINESSES PROFITABILITY.

OUR CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS

INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

THE DETERIORATION OF THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN

DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS.

DURING 2008 AND CONTINUING IN 2009, HIGHER LEVELS OF BANK FAILURES HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED

RESOLUTION COSTS OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION AND DEPLETED THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE

FUND. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG FUNDING POSITION AND RESTORE RESERVE RATIOS OF THE DEPOSIT

INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC HAS INCREASED ASSESSMENT RATES OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS AND ADOPTED A RULE

IN NOVEMBER 2009 REQUIRING BANKS TO PREPAY THREE YEARS WORTH OF PREMIUMS TO REPLENISH THE DEPLETED

INSURANCE FUND. IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FAILURES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED

TO PAY EVEN HIGHER FDIC PREMIUMS THAN THE RECENTLY INCREASED LEVELS. ANY FUTURE INCREASES OF FDIC

INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS (WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT RECOURSE), THE

ORIGINATOR IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A VARIETY OF CUSTOMARY

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

REGARDING BOTH THE ORIGINATOR AND THE LOANS BEING SOLD OR SECURITIZED. WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS ENTITIES ACQUIRED BY US AS PART OF THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER, AND THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, HAVE MADE SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF OUR LENDING BUSINESS.

IF A LOAN  DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES

IS SOLD OR SECURITIZED, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN AND BEAR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS

DIRECTLY, OR WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSSES. IN 2009, THE

COSTS OF REPURCHASING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SOLD TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS FREDDIE MAC

AND FANNIE MAE  INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, AND COULD CONTINUE TO

INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY FURTHER. ACCORDINGLY,  REPURCHASE AND/OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES OR TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITIONS, OR FURTHER CONTINUED

DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC, MARKET OR BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT

ON THE FIRM IN THE FUTURE.

IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. SOME

POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE

MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER

ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND

LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN US OR OUR PROSPECTS. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY

EVENTS OVER WHICH WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN

2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED OUR COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED OUR ACCESS TO SOME OF OUR

TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, LOANS,

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS. THESE OR OTHER CONDITIONS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY

MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES, INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING

TO LEND TO US, THEREBY CURTAILING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION

IN THE RATINGS OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT

COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,

TO US BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING. CRITICAL FACTORS IN

MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM, STRONG CAPITAL

RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, AND

DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES.

OUR COST OF OBTAINING LONG-TERM UNSECURED FUNDING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CREDIT SPREADS (THE

AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE INTEREST RATE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES (OR OTHER BENCHMARK SECURITIES)

OF THE SAME MATURITY THAT WE NEED TO PAY TO OUR DEBT INVESTORS). INCREASES IN OUR CREDIT SPREADS

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF THIS FUNDING. CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS ARE CONTINUOUS AND

MARKET-DRIVEN, AND INFLUENCED BY MARKET PERCEPTIONS OF OUR CREDITWORTHINESS. AS SUCH, OUR CREDIT

SPREADS MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE AND HIGHLY VOLATILE.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE RELY ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR OUR CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE

FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES AND LENDING COMMITMENTS,

DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

OUR EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS. WE ESTIMATE AND ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR

CREDIT RISKS AND POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THIS PROCESS, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION,

REQUIRES DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR BORROWERS TO REPAY THEIR LOANS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY

SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT WE WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR

THAT WE WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY. ANY SUCH FAILURE

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK

IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING PERIODS OF

MARKET ILLIQUIDITY, SUCH AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND EARLY 2009. DURING SUCH PERIODS, OUR CREDIT

RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY US CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS

LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN OR DERIVATIVE

EXPOSURE DUE US. IN ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT

ANY SUCH LOSSES WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS

THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (LBHI). ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2008, LBHI FILED A

VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF TITLE 11 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE (THE

BANKRUPTCY CODE) IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND

THEREAFTER SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11

OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE (LBHI AND SUCH SUBSIDIARIES COLLECTIVELY, LEHMAN). ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008,

A LIQUIDATION CASE UNDER THE SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT

(SIPA) WAS COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. (LBI), LBHIS U.S.

BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARY, AND THAT COURT NOW PRESIDES OVER THE LBI

SIPA LIQUIDATION CASE. WE WERE LBIS CLEARING BANK AND,

AMONG OTHER ACTIONS, MADE COLLATERAL CALLS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8

BILLION IN SEPTEMBER 2008 AND LIQUIDATED APPROXIMATELY $18 BILLION OF SECURITIES SUBSEQUENT TO

LEHMANS BANKRUPTCY FILING. WE ARE THE LARGEST SECURED CREDITOR IN THE LEHMAN AND LBI CASES,

ACCORDING TO LEHMANS SCHEDULES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US AND/OR OUR

SECURITY INTERESTS, INCLUDING BY THE LBHI CREDITORS COMMITTEE, THE SIPA TRUSTEE APPOINTED IN THE

LBI LIQUIDATION CASE, THE PRINCIPAL ACQUIRER OF LBIS ASSETS, AND OTHERS IN CONNECTION WITH LEHMAN

AND LBI CASES. WE INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELF AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS. THE LBHI EXAMINER HAS FILED A

REPORT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT REGARDING HIS INVESTIGATION INTO THE

COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN. THE

REPORT REMAINS UNDER SEAL.

IF THE CURRENT WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, OR DETERIORATES

FURTHER, THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME

DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO US WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL

OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE

OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT

DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE

CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY, THEREBY EXACERBATING OUR CREDIT RISK

EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES, INCLUDING MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES, WE COULD INCUR IN OUR

TRADING AND CLEARING BUSINESSES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO

ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO

AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND ANY CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK COULD

INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN OUR CREDIT PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN

THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO SELL,

SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS HELD BY US, THEREBY

LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS OF SUCH POSITIONS. THESE CONCENTRATIONS COULD EXPOSE US TO

LOSSES IF THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES, LOANS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS OR POSITIONS

DECLINE CAUSING US TO TAKE WRITE DOWNS. MOREOVER, THE INABILITY TO REDUCE OUR POSITIONS NOT ONLY

INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL

OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND

FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO US.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO US. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES

AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISKS AND

PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE

INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE

FUTURE, RISKS THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET

ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO

DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

REDUCE OUR RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

OUR DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE US TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT

COULD CAUSE US TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT

EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME

CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO

ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN

OF OUR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT WE DO NOT OWN; IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES,

COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE US TO

FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO US AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR

REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE DERIVATIVES

TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT

AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, WE MAY FIND THE CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT TO

ENFORCE. FURTHER, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING THE

TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF THE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE US TO INCUR

UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND LEGAL COSTS, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

EFFECTIVELY OUR RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET

BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY US ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET

STRESS, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING 2008, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY

MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR

ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIES, CAUSING US TO INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS OUR BUSINESSES CHANGE AND GROW AND THE

MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP

SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED,

MONITORED OR MANAGED. WE CANNOT PROVIDE

ASSURANCE THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING OUR

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY, POLITICAL, LEGAL

AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES.

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN

THE UNITED STATES. ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING

AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO

MATERIALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, SUCH AS DEBT SECURITIES AND

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). ITS POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWERS, POTENTIALLY

INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF

THESE CHANGES ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

OUR BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES OR ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VARIOUS

UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR INVEST, OR IN

WHICH WE MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS

PARTICULAR TO THAT COUNTRY OR REGION, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR

LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY

ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE

ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE

FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE

FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE

ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS.

ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST,

AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OUR OPERATIONS

IN THE U.S. ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE US TO SIGNIFICANT COST

AND LIABILITY.

WE ENGAGE IN POWER GENERATION, AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT

BANK, WE ENGAGE IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS,

ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE EXPECT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR POWER

GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION,

LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS. OUR POWER GENERATION AND COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER

EXPOSES US TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS,

SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND

TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO

OUR REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR POWER GENERATION ACTIVITIES ARE

SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF

POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL

FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO

OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. OUR

ACTIONS TO MITIGATE OUR RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE

TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE

AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER

LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

WE RELY ON OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF OUR FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE

ARE SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR

OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES OUR OPERATIONS OR

SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO US,

INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF

THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN

POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN OUR POSSESSION WERE

TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR

EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO

PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE

INFORMATION, EITHER BY FAULT OF OUR SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR SUCH INFORMATION WAS

INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR

PARTIALLY BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, ELECTRICAL OR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, OR OTHER DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS; HEALTH

EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING

TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR

LIABILITY TO US.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS OURS, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE

RISK THAT OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

COULD PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING US TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY

EXPOSING US TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

WE OPERATE WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE

LAWS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE TYPE AND MANNER IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY

TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED.

RECENT MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO NEW LEGISLATION AND NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR

CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATION AND REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATION

AFFECTING THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CARD SERVICES BUSINESS BY

REDUCING REVENUE AND INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS.

RECENT PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER REGULATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND

INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDE CALLS TO INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS; LIMIT THE SIZE

AND TYPES OF THE ACTIVITIES PERMITTED; AND INCREASE TAXES ON SOME INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2009 RECENTLY PASSED BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ESTABLISH A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAVING

BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS CREATE A STRUCTURE TO REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

COMPANIES, AND PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE POWER TO REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER

ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES IF THE REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF

THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF

THE UNITED STATES. ALSO PROPOSED IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES MARKET, INCLUDING PROVIDING FOR

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MORE STRICT CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER

DERIVATIVES, AND HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION OF ALL OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALERS AND MAJOR

MARKET PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE FIRM.

THESE NEW (AND OTHER) LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

REVENUE, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WE MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING

IN, IMPACT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT WE HOLD, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES.

ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATION WOULD NOT HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR

OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESSES IN THE

JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT

HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. AS THIS REGULATORY TREND CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM

PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US.

WE ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR ARE OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS

ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR

PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST US MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS,

SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO US, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE US SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL

HARM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY WE WILL CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR

BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WE EXPECT COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO

INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER,

BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER

ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

WE ALSO FACE AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST

COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES,

E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR

NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING

PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC

AND

INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. OUR BUSINESSES

GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION

EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF

THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE US TO

LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT

IN OUR BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY

REQUIRE US TO EXTEND MORE OF OUR CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE

COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE BENEFITS

ANTICIPATED.

WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS,

INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE

INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED

ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE

COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS,

SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. INTEGRATION EFFORTS COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT

ANY INTEGRATION EFFORTS OF ACQUISITIONS ALREADY CONSUMMATED OR ANY NEW ACQUISITIONS WOULD NOT

RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES.

WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED CREDIT COSTS OR NEED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MARKDOWNS AND

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE ASSETS AND LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER (THE BEAR STEARNS

MERGER) BY JPMORGAN CHASE AND THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. (BEAR STEARNS) AND IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL BANKS (WASHINGTON MUTUAL) BANKING OPERATIONS (THE

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTION). WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT AS OUR INTEGRATION EFFORTS CONTINUE IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, OTHER UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO REMOVE THEIR ACCOUNTS FROM US AND MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN

THE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND

POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS,

DEPOSITORS AND EMPLOYEES. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS.

DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR ATTRACTING AND MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS,

INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO OUR

REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT,

LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY,

COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING US, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO OUR PROSPECTS.

ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE

INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS

IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG OUR CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE

TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH

US, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO US.

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE.

OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON US OR ON OUR EMPLOYEES

OF CERTAIN OF THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS OR TAXES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, OUR PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD

CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WE ARE

REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING

IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN

REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN

ORDER TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE MAY

MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY

RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE

NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION

PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, BEING BASED ON

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION

AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN

PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET

ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR

ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO DECLINES IN OUR EARNINGS.
