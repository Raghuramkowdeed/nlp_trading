ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION

ON PAGE 157. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, IN MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER

REPORTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES,

INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES;

INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE

CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF

CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND THE HEALTH

OF U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS CAN AFFECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

THE FIRMS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES; THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS; THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND,

THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; AND THE WILLINGNESS OF

FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED

BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY

MARKETS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE FIRM MAY HAVE TRADING POSITIONS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY

OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

FIRMS SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND

EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES, MARKETS CREDIT SPREADS, AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT

REVENUE RELATING TO ITS TRADING AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL AFFECT PRICING OR THE ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS, AND

THAT THIS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN

IN SECURITIES MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES

OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUE. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET

CONCERNS MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRMS FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE

OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, SUB-PAR

PERFORMANCE BY THE FIRMS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD CAUSE OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE;

CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. ANY DETERIORATION IN THESE

CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR

INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES OR PERSISTENT HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, COULD LEAD TO AN

INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH

CAN REDUCE THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASES LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL

CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE

OTHERWISE DISRUPTED, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS

THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN

SELLING OR

PART I

INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET

OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED

BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR

CONFIDENCE AND RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE

FIRMS COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH

AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS, AND

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND CHASE BANK USA, N.A. ARE

IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THEIR CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE

FIRMS ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS OR MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING DEBT, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL

COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING

OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY

CURTAILING THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS

OF CERTAIN SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENTS COULD ALSO

IMPAIR THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE FIRM

BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE FUNDING.

CRITICAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING HIGH CREDIT RATINGS INCLUDE A STABLE AND DIVERSE EARNINGS STREAM,

STRONG CAPITAL RATIOS, STRONG CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES,

AND DISCIPLINED LIQUIDITY MONITORING PROCEDURES. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES

FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED

IN THE FUTURE. SUCH DOWNGRADES MAY COME AT TIMES

OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY, WHEN THE FIRMS OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS ARE MORE LIMITED

AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH

FLOW AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER

REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN

THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD REDUCE ITS LIQUIDITY

POSITION.

SOME GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING LARGE BANKS TO

INCORPORATE A SEPARATE SUBSIDIARY IN EVERY COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND TO MAINTAIN

INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY FOR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. IF ADOPTED, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD

DECREASE THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND INCREASE THE RISK OF ITS LIQUIDITY POSITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, INCLUDING

RECENTLY-ADOPTED LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL

AS THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF EACH

OF THE VARIOUS OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE FIRM DOES

BUSINESS, MAY RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES, LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS

PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR MAKE OFFERING ITS PRODUCTS TO CLIENTS MORE EXPENSIVE.

EXTENSIVE LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADOPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULATIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT WAS ADOPTED IN

2010 AND WILL EFFECT SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. THIS

LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS: THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION WHICH WILL HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THE FIRM OFFERS; THE CREATION OF A STRUCTURE TO

REGULATE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE POWER TO

REQUIRE SUCH COMPANIES TO SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS AND TERMINATE ACTIVITIES IF THE REGULATORS

DETERMINE THAT THE SIZE OR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY AND

SOUNDNESS OF THE COMPANY OR THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES; MORE COMPREHENSIVE

REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES MARKET, INCLUDING PROVIDING FOR HIGHER CAPITAL AND

MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, THE CENTRAL CLEARING OF STANDARDIZED OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES, AND

HEIGHTENED SUPERVISION OF ALL OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES DEALERS AND MAJOR MARKET PARTICIPANTS,

INCLUDING THE FIRM; SO-CALLED PUSH OUT PROVISIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANTLY

RESTRUCTURE OR RESTRICT ITS DERIVATIVES BUSINESSES, CHANGE THE LEGAL ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH SUCH

BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED, OR LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE COLLATERAL, MARGIN AND OTHER RISKS;

PROHIBITIONS ON THE FIRM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN PROPRIETARY TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RESTRICTING ITS OWNERSHIP OF,

INVESTMENT IN OR SPONSORSHIP OF, HEDGE FUNDS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS; RESTRICTIONS ON THE

INTERCHANGE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS; AND A REQUIREMENT THAT BANK

REGULATORS PHASE OUT THE TREATMENT OF TRUST PREFERRED CAPITAL DEBT SECURITIES AS TIER 1 CAPITAL FOR

REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES.

THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS CREATED A EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD TO MONITOR FINANCIAL STABILITY

AND IMPLEMENTED RULES THAT WILL INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN TRADING INSTRUMENTS OR

EXPOSURES AND IMPOSE COMPENSATION LIMITS ON CERTAIN EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE EU COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER INITIATIVES, INCLUDING NEW

LEGISLATION THAT WILL AFFECT DERIVATIVES TRADING, IMPOSE SURCHARGES ON GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FIRMS AND POSSIBLY IMPOSE NEW LEVIES ON BANK BALANCE SHEETS.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2010 REVISIONS TO ITS CAPITAL

ACCORD, WHICH WILL REQUIRE HIGHER CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS, NARROW THE DEFINITION OF

CAPITAL, AND INTRODUCE SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY AND TERM FUNDING STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. ALSO

BEING CONSIDERED IS THE IMPOSITION OF A BANK SURCHARGE ON INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE

GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD INCREASE THE FIRMS FUNDING

AND OPERATIONAL COSTS.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE AND ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES, AND ANY

REQUIRED CHANGES TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM SUCH LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS,

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE, LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING, AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE

FIRM HOLDS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS,

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS WOULD

NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE

FUTURE.

IF THE FIRM DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO ITS

OPERATIONS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES

IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND

ENFORCEMENT HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND INCREASING THE POTENTIAL

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. AS THIS REGULATORY TREND CONTINUES, IT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASES CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WERE TO DETERIORATE, MORE OF JPMORGAN CHASES CUSTOMERS MAY

BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR IN REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM

PURCHASE ASSETS FROM OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING TO ITS CLIENTS

AND COUNTERPARTIES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ONE OF THE FIRMS COUNTERPARTIES COULD LEAD TO

CONCERNS IN THE MARKET ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OTHER COUNTERPARTIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY,

THEREBY EXACERBATING THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE, AND INCREASING THE LOSSES (INCLUDING

MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES) THAT THE FIRM COULD INCUR IN ITS TRADING AND CLEARING BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND

HEDGE FUNDS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT

RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, WHICH CAN BE EXACERBATED DURING

PERIODS OF MARKET ILLIQUIDITY. DURING SUCH PERIODS, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER

INCREASED WHEN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE FIRM CANNOT BE REALIZED UPON OR IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES

THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO

THE FIRM. IN ADDITION, DISPUTES WITH COUNTERPARTIES AS TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY, AS EXPERIENCED IN 2008

AND EARLY 2009, MAY OCCUR AGAIN AND COULD PRODUCE LOSSES IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REALIZE UPON

COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS

PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR

HEDGE ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, INCREASED CONCENTRATION WITHIN THE FIRMS SECURITIES OR LOAN PORTFOLIOS, OR IN OTHER

POSITIONS THAT THE FIRM MAY HOLD, MAY OCCUR FOR REASONS OUTSIDE OF THE FIRMS CONTROL. DISRUPTIONS

IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRMS INABILITY TO

SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE UPON ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE

INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRMS POSITIONS NOT ONLY INCREASES THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASES THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE FIRMS BALANCE

SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO

THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM

HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE

THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK,

INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE

EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE

FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF THE FIRMS RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS THE FIRMS BUSINESSES CHANGE AND GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH

THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP

SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. AS A RESULT, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED,

MONITORED OR MANAGED. IN ADDITION, IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRMS

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING

TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH

CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF

SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

THE FIRMS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES, LENDING COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT

ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST

LENDERS, THE FIRM HAS EXPOSURES ARISING FROM ITS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS EARNINGS. THE FIRM

ESTABLISHES RESERVES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES

PART I

INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNFUNDED

LENDING COMMITMENTS). THE FIRM ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER METHODS TO DETERMINE THE

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET

EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE

DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT

IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER

OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT THE FIRM

WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE

IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES TRADING BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND

OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET

VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY

UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA) MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS

NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A TRADING

INSTRUMENT SUCH AS A DERIVATIVE. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL

SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE

FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME

FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN

SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY

BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A

DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES. IN PARTICULAR, DISPUTES

REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD

FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, AND

IMPAIR THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THE FIRMS HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN

HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON

MANAGEMENTS SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET

INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES,

PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED

INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR

UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE

ASSURANCE THAT ITS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE FIRMS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR

STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY,

POLITICAL, LEGAL AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE

ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE

PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE RETURN EARNED ON

THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. THE MARKET IMPACT FROM SUCH POLICIES CAN ALSO MATERIALLY DECREASE THE

VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS). FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD POLICIES ALSO CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES,

POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THEY MAY FAIL TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR SATISFY THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO THE FIRM. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND

MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES) ARE BEYOND THE

FIRMS CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES ON THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN

SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE

POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, EXPROPRIATION,

NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION, WAR OR MILITARY ACTIONS, ACTS OF TERRORISM AND

A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ARE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN CERTAIN

EMERGING MARKETS.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY

BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE

FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE

VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE

COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRMS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH

UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL

AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED,

OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON

OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS OR MAY CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND

THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN

THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THAT COUNTRY OR

REGION, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG

OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. IN 2010, CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,

INCLUDING GREECE, IRELAND, ITALY, PORTUGAL AND SPAIN, REGARDING PERCEIVED WEAKNESSES IN THEIR

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONDITION, AND HOW SUCH WEAKNESSES MIGHT AFFECT OTHER ECONOMIES AS WELL AS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM, WHICH LENT FUNDS TO OR DID BUSINESS WITH OR IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOAN REPURCHASE AND INDEMNITY

OBLIGATIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF LOANS (WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT RECOURSE), THE

ORIGINATOR IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE A VARIETY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BOTH

THE ORIGINATOR AND THE LOANS BEING SOLD OR SECURITIZED. JPMORGAN CHASE AND SOME OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THOSE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE BEAR STEARNS MERGER AND THE WASHINGTON MUTUAL

TRANSACTION, HAVE MADE SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE AND

SECURITIZATION OF LOANS, AND THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WHEN IT SECURITIZES LOANS IT HAS

ORIGINATED. IF A LOAN THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IS SOLD OR

SECURITIZED, THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE LOAN AND INCUR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS

DIRECTLY, OR THE FIRM MAY BE OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSSES. IN 2010,

THE COSTS OF REPURCHASING MORTGAGE LOANS THAT HAD BEEN SOLD TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS FANNIE

MAE AND FREDDIE MAC (THE GSES) INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH COSTS

COULD NOT CONTINUE TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY, REPURCHASE

OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS TO THE GSES OR TO PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PURCHASERS COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE.

THE REPURCHASE LIABILITY THAT THE FIRM RECORDS WITH RESPECT TO ITS LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS IS

ESTIMATED BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE

REPURCHASE DEMANDS MADE BY PURCHASERS, THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CURE THE DEFECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE

REPURCHASES DEMANDS, AND THE SEVERITY OF LOSS UPON REPURCHASE OR FORECLOSURE. WHILE THE FIRM

BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT REPURCHASE LIABILITY RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE, THE FACTORS REFERRED TO ABOVE

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN LIGHT OF MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER

CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH RESERVES MAY BE INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES LITIGATION RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO SECURITIZATIONS NOT

SOLD TO THE GSES. THE FIRM SEPARATELY EVALUATES ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH LITIGATION IN ESTABLISHING ITS

LITIGATION RESERVES. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESERVES IN RESPECT OF SUCH

LITIGATION MATTERS ARE ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RESERVES WILL NOT NEED TO BE

INCREASED IN THE FUTURE.

JPMORGAN CHASE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ENSURING THAT IT SATISFIES REQUIREMENTS

RELATING TO MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES.

IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2010, JPMORGAN CHASE COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF

OBTAINING MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE JUDGMENTS IN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT REQUIRE A JUDICIAL

FORECLOSURE PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FIRM EXTENDED THIS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION TO FORECLOSURE SALES

IN THOSE STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT REQUIRE A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE PROCESS, AND TO FORECLOSURES

AND FORECLOSURE SALES IN THE MAJORITY OF REMAINING

STATES WHERE A JUDICIAL PROCESS IS NOT REQUIRED,

BUT WHERE AN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS PART OF THE FORECLOSURE

PROCESS. IN MID-OCTOBER, THE FIRM ALSO TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED EVICTIONS IN THE STATES AND

TERRITORIES IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD SUSPENDED FORECLOSURES AND FORECLOSURE SALES, AS WELL AS IN

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL STATES IN WHICH AN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY FIRM PERSONNEL MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN

CONNECTION WITH EVICTION PROCEEDINGS.

THIS TEMPORARY SUSPENSION AROSE OUT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS PREPARED BY LOCAL

FORECLOSURE COUNSEL, SIGNED BY FIRM EMPLOYEES, AND FILED OR USED IN MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE

PROCEEDINGS IN CERTAIN STATES. BASED ON THE FIRMS WORK TO DATE, THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT THE

INFORMATION IN THOSE AFFIDAVITS OF INDEBTEDNESS ABOUT THE FACT OF DEFAULT AND AMOUNT OF

INDEBTEDNESS WAS MATERIALLY ACCURATE. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING REVIEW AND VERIFICATION OF THIS

INFORMATION WAS PERFORMED BY PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THE AFFIANTS, OR THE AFFIDAVITS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

PROPERLY NOTARIZED. THE FIRM HAS SINCE RESUMED FILING NEW FORECLOSURE ACTIONS IN MOST OF THE STATES

IN WHICH THE FIRM HAD PREVIOUSLY HALTED SUCH ACTIONS, USING REVISED PROCEDURES IN CONNECTION WITH

THE EXECUTION OF THE AFFIDAVITS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE USED IN THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS,

AND THE FIRM INTENDS TO RESUME FILING NEW FORECLOSURE ACTIONS IN ALL REMAINING STATES. THE FIRM IS

ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING PENDING FORECLOSURE MATTERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REMEDIATION

OF PREVIOUSLY FILED AFFIDAVITS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS IS NECESSARY, AND THE FIRM

INTENDS TO RESUME PENDING FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AS THE REVIEW, AND IF NECESSARY, REMEDIATION, OF

EACH PENDING MATTER IS COMPLETED.

THE FIRM EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EFFORTS TO CORRECT

AND ENHANCE ITS MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES. MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE ANNOUNCED

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY MORTGAGE SERVICING COMPANIES AND BANKS, INCLUDING

JPMORGAN CHASE AND ITS AFFILIATES,

RELATING TO FORECLOSURE

AND LOSS MITIGATION PROCESSES.

THE FIRM IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS,

AND THESE INVESTIGATIONS COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL FINES, PENALTIES, EQUITABLE REMEDIES

(INCLUDING REQUIRING DEFAULT SERVICING OR OTHER PROCESS CHANGES), OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL COSTS IN RESPONDING TO GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ADDITIONAL LITIGATION.

THE FIRM CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE IMPACT THAT THEY COULD HAVE ON THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND

LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES,

INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER,

EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO ENGAGED IN

POWER GENERATION AND HAS INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING

AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND

IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY, AND TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER

REVENUES FROM THE FIRMS COMMODITIES

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS

IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. FURTHERMORE,

LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS.

THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC

SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN

PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF

OPERATIONS. THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

OUTSIDE OF THE FIRMS CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT,

TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY

THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW

MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE FIRMS ACTIONS TO

MITIGATE ITS RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS

EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND

THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT

TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASES REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN

CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT

HARM TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS

SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR

REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, OR A FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

FAIRLY, CAN RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ALL

OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST REVENUE, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND HARM TO REPUTATION FOR THE FIRM.

ADVERSE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRMS

PROSPECTS. ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR

INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRMS REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN

TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRMS REPUTATION OCCUR,

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO

ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING RISE TO THE REPUTATIONAL HARM COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS

EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM

CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND

INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRMS CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO

DEAL WITH THE FIRM, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS CAUSE SERIOUS

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A

LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING

SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF ONE OF ITS EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS

A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES

THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE

SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH

PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, INCREASED

OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE FIRMS

POSSESSION WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT

PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER BY FAULT OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR

COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY

THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY

OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRMS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES,

ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE

FIRMS PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING

FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE

RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT

DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. AS PROCESSES

ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR

IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE RISK

THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS

COULD PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY

REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT,

AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED

BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY

RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASES INABILITY TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITIVE

CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

PRODUCES LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF

OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS,

HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND

COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES

PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER

INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. THE FIRMS BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE

BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION,

INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS

MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO

LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE

EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO

EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS

FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND THE INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF

THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER

BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED

POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED

TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMBINED ENTITY; OR AN IMPROVED PRICE FOR JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION EFFORTS

COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS

OR RESULTS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT ANY INTEGRATION EFFORTS IN CONNECTION WITH

ACQUISITIONS ALREADY CONSUMMATED OR ANY NEW ACQUISITIONS WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE OCCURRENCE OF

UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR LOSSES.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE CUSTOMERS OR CAUSE

CUSTOMERS TO MOVE THEIR BUSINESS TO COMPETING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

INTEGRATION PROCESS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN THE DISRUPTION OF THE FIRMS ONGOING

BUSINESSES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS, DEPOSITORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS. THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION

WITH AN ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

ITS BUSINESS, AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRMS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON THE

FIRM OR ITS EMPLOYEES OF CERTAIN EXISTING AND PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS OR TAXES ON EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF

INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE IS

REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING

IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY AND RESERVES RELATED TO

LITIGATIONS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS,

REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE

LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, AS THEY ARE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION

AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS

11

PART I

AND

SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR

ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE

MATERIAL LOSSES.
