ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH THE MATERIAL RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASE

S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

REGULATORY RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, AND THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM, JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE WAY THAT THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AND CAN RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF THE FIRMS EXISTING BUSINESSES AND LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, OR CAN MAKE ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS.

THE FIRM IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION, AND SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW THE FIRM CONDUCTS BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT AND COMPREHENSIVE NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED IN RECENT YEARS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY, MOST NOTABLY THE DODD-FRANK ACT IN THE UNITED STATES. CERTAIN KEY REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE VOLCKER RULE AND THE U.S. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS HAVE NOW BEEN ADOPTED, AND THE FIRM CONTINUES TO

MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS, LEGAL ENTITY STRUCTURE AND CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO

COMPLY WITH THESE AND OTHER NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, U.S. AND OTHER REGULATORS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, PROPOSE AND ADOPT RULES AND PROPOSE NEW REGULATORY INITIATIVES, SO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ALL OF THE NEW LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS ON THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS THAT SIMILAR REGULATORY INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND REGIONS IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE DOES BUSINESS. NON-U.S. REGULATIONS AND

INITIATIVES MAY BE INCONSISTENT OR MAY CONFLICT WITH CURRENT OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH COULD CREATE INCREASED COMPLIANCE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE FIRM AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS, OPERATIONS OR PROFITABILITY.

THESE RECENT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE FIRM, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE FIRM OR OTHERWISE REDUCE THE FIRMS PROFITABILITY, LIMIT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH IT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSIDER ENGAGING, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO DISPOSE OF OR CURTAIL CERTAIN BUSINESSES, AFFECT THE VALUE OF ASSETS THAT THE FIRM HOLDS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

EXPANDED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES WILL INCREASE THE FIRMS COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS AND MAY REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF THOSE BUSINESSES.

IN RECENT YEARS THE FIRM HAS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL CONSENT ORDERS WITH ITS BANKING REGULATORS AND SETTLEMENTS WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO IN APRIL 2011 RELATING TO THE FIRMS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING, FORECLOSURE AND LOSS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES; THE FEBRUARY 2012 GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION OF MORTGAGES; THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO IN JANUARY 2013 RELATING TO THE FIRMS BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND TO CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS TRADING ACTIVITIES; THE CONSENT ORDERS ENTERED INTO SEPTEMBER 2013 CONCERNING OVERSIGHT OF THIRD PARTIES, OPERATIONAL PROCESSES AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CREDIT CARD COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PRACTICES AND TO BILLING PRACTICES FOR CREDIT MONITORING PRODUCTS FORMERLY OFFERED BY THE FIRM; THE SETTLEMENTS IN NOVEMBER 2013 OF CERTAIN REPURCHASE REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS BY A GROUP OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL RELATING TO CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM, BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL; THE DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN JANUARY 2014 WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH THE OCC AND THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK ("FINCEN") RELATING TO BERNARD L. MADOFF INVESTMENT SECURITIES LLC AND THE FIRM'S AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM; AND THE FEBRUARY

2014 SETTLEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH SEVERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELATING TO THE FIRMS PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN FEDERAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS REQUIRE THE FIRM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIED DEFICIENCIES IN CERTAIN CONTROLS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES; IN SOME CASES, TO ENGAGE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL PERSONNEL TO REVIEW PAST TRANSACTIONS OR TO MONITOR THE EXTENT TO WHICH CITED LAPSES

9

PART I

HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED; AND TO FURNISH ITS REGULATORS WITH PERIODIC REPORTS CONCERNING THE FIRMS PROGRESS IN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS. THE FIRM HAS ALSO PAID SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES OR PROVIDED MONETARY AND OTHER RELIEF IN CONNECTION WITH MANY OF THESE ACTIONS AND SETTLEMENTS.

THE FIRM IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS, THE EXPANSION OF RISK AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS WITHIN EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE HIRING OF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ADDITIONAL RISK, CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL, ALL OF WHICH HAS INCREASED THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE FIRM IS EXPERIENCING HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONSUMER BUSINESSES. THE FIRM EXPECTS THAT SUCH REGULATORY SCRUTINY WILL CONTINUE, AND THAT REGULATORS WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION, RATHER THAN TAKING INFORMAL SUPERVISORY ACTIONS, MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THEY HAVE DONE HISTORICALLY.

IF THE FIRM FAILS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSENT ORDERS, THE DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT, OR MORE GENERALLY, TO EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE ITS RISK AND CONTROL PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MEET HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS BY ITS REGULATORS, IT MAY CONTINUE TO FACE A GREATER NUMBER OR WIDER SCOPE OF INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND LITIGATION, THEREBY INCREASING ITS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO OR DEFENDING SUCH ACTIONS, AND IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO FURTHER ORDERS AND SETTLEMENTS, PAY ADDITIONAL FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, OR ACCEPT MATERIAL REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON ITS BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND, IN TURN, ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, FURTHER REGULATORY INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS AND ACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE FIRMS BUSINESSES, AND ANY REQUIRED CHANGES TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUE, LIMIT THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THE FIRM OFFERS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO INCREASE ITS PRICES AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ON THE FIRM, CAUSE HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

UNDER THE FIRMS RESOLUTION PLAN REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, HOLDERS OF THE FIRMS DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT CLEAR RISK OF LOSS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, JPMORGAN CHASE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC ITS ANNUAL UPDATE TO ITS PLAN FOR RESOLUTION OF THE FIRM. THE FIRMS RESOLUTION PLAN INCLUDES STRATEGIES TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, AND ALSO RECOMMENDS TO THE FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE

THE FIRMS PROPOSED OPTIMAL STRATEGY TO RESOLVE THE FIRM UNDER THE SPECIAL RESOLUTION PROCEDURE PROVIDED IN TITLE II OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT (TITLE II).

THE FIRMS RECOMMENDATION FOR ITS OPTIMAL TITLE II STRATEGY WOULD INVOLVE A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY RECAPITALIZATION MODEL IN WHICH THE FDIC WOULD USE ITS POWER TO CREATE A BRIDGE ENTITY FOR JPMORGAN CHASE, TRANSFER THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AND VIABLE PARTS OF THE FIRMS BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY THE STOCK OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S MAIN OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AGAINST SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, TO THE BRIDGE ENTITY, RECAPITALIZE THOSE BUSINESSES BY CONTRIBUTING SOME OR ALL OF SUCH INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS TO THE CAPITAL OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, AND BY EXCHANGING DEBT CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FOR EQUITY IN THE BRIDGE ENTITY. IF THE FIRM WERE TO BE RESOLVED UNDER THIS STRATEGY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE BRIDGE ENTITY DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOLDERS OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY OR SATISFY ALL OR PART OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF, AND INTEREST ON, THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH SUCH STOCK WAS EXCHANGED.

MARKET RISK

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE LIQUIDITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EVENTS THAT REDUCE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERAL WEATHER CONDITIONS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; MONETARY POLICIES AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AND THE HEALTH OF U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES.

IN THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS CAN AFFECT TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES; THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS; THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS; AND THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR OTHER INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS EXTENSIVE MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITIES AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FACILITATE CLIENT DEMAND AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS. THE FIRM MAY HAVE MARKET-MAKING POSITIONS THAT LACK PRICING TRANSPARENCY OR LIQUIDITY. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE POSITIONS IS AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FIRMS SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY HEDGING ITS MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS, CREDIT SPREADS, AND

10

AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, ALL OF WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FIRM ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUE RELATING TO ITS MARKET-MAKING AND PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY, WHICH WILL AFFECT PRICING OR THE ABILITY TO REALIZE RETURNS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES, AND THAT THIS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES THAT THE FIRM EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN SECURITIES MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS THAT THE FIRM MANAGES OR HOLDS IN CUSTODY, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUE. MACROECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS MAY ALSO PROMPT OUTFLOWS FROM THE FIRMS FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS.

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET AND THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRM EARNS FROM NET INTEREST INCOME. A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT OR A FLAT OR INVERTED YIELD CURVE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES BY COMPRESSING NET INTEREST MARGINS, REDUCING THE AMOUNTS THAT THE FIRM EARNS ON ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR REDUCING THE VALUE OF ITS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSR) ASSET, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRMS NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER REVENUES.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES. IF THE CURRENT POSITIVE TRENDS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY ARE NOT SUSTAINED, THIS COULD DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES OR PERSISTENT HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE FIRM TO BORROW ON BOTH A SECURED AND UNSECURED BASIS. CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN OR NARROW NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO FIRM-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS AND CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THE FIRMS CREDIT SPREADS WILL IMPACT, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FIRMS EARNINGS ON LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FINALLY, ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE FIRMS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE RECENT EUROZONE DEBT CRISIS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OR MORE SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULTS, SIGNIFICANT BANK FAILURES OR DEFAULTS AND/OR THE EXIT OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DECLINES IN MARKET LIQUIDITY, A CONTRACTION OF

AVAILABLE CREDIT, AND DIMINISHED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IN THE EUROZONE. THERE ARE CONTINUING CONCERNS AS TO THE ULTIMATE FINANCIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ASSISTANCE MEASURES TAKEN TO DATE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUSTERITY MEASURES MAY EXACERBATE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND TEST THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STABILITY OF WEAKER ECONOMIES IN THE EUROZONE. THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BOTH BY LOCALIZED ECONOMIC CRISES IN PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS OR WHEN REGIONAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL CAUSES DETERIORATION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CREDIT RISK

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF JPMORGAN CHASES CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF MARKET-MAKING, TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. THE FIRM ROUTINELY EXECUTES TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL AND HEDGE FUNDS, INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. MANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK AND, IN SOME CASES, DISPUTES AND LITIGATION IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT.

THE FIRM IS A MARKET LEADER IN PROVIDING CLEARING AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES, AND ALSO ACTS AS A CLEARING AND CUSTODY BANK IN THE SECURITIES AND REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET, INCLUDING THE U.S. TRI-PARTY REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET. MANY OF THESE SERVICES EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COUNTERPARTY OR CLIENT, A CENTRAL COUNTERPARTY (CCP) OR ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT.

AS PART OF PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES, THE FIRM IS A MEMBER OF A NUMBER OF CCPS, AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE LOSSES INCURRED BY SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DEFAULT OF OTHER MEMBERS. AS A CLEARING MEMBER, THE FIRM IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY ITS CLIENTS, WHICH IT SEEKS TO MITIGATE THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE COLLATERAL. IN ITS ROLE AS CUSTODIAN BANK IN THE SECURITIES AND REPURCHASE TRANSACTION MARKET, THE FIRM CAN BE EXPOSED TO INTRA-DAY CREDIT RISK OF ITS CLIENTS. IF A CLIENT TO WHOM THE FIRM PROVIDES SUCH SERVICES BECOMES BANKRUPT OR INSOLVENT, THE FIRM MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN DISPUTES AND LITIGATION WITH VARIOUS PARTIES, INCLUDING ONE OR MORE CCPS, THE CLIENTS BANKRUPTCY ESTATE AND OTHER CREDITORS, OR INVOLVED IN REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS. ALL OF SUCH EVENTS CAN INCREASE THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL AND LITIGATION COSTS AND MAY RESULT IN LOSSES IF ANY COLLATERAL RECEIVED BY THE FIRM DECLINES IN VALUE.

DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS OR ILLIQUIDITY, THE FIRMS CREDIT RISK ALSO MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED WHEN THE FIRM CANNOT REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY IT OR WHEN COLLATERAL IS LIQUIDATED AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN, DERIVATIVE OR OTHER EXPOSURE DUE TO THE FIRM. FURTHER, DISPUTES WITH OBLIGORS AS

11

PART I

TO THE VALUATION OF COLLATERAL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS AND ILLIQUIDITY. PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY COULD PRODUCE LOSSES IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO REALIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL OR MANAGE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPOSURE TO INCREASED LEVELS OF RISK WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR WHEN THEY HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF ITS PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATION RISKS. THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OR HEDGE ITS CREDIT PORTFOLIO AGAINST CONCENTRATION RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN THE LIQUIDITY OR TRANSPARENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE FIRMS INABILITY TO SELL, SYNDICATE OR REALIZE THE VALUE OF ITS POSITIONS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED CONCENTRATIONS. THE INABILITY TO REDUCE THE FIRMS POSITIONS MAY NOT ONLY INCREASE THE MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH POSITIONS, BUT ALSO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THE FIRMS BALANCE SHEET, THEREBY INCREASING ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING COSTS, ALL OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

LIQUIDITY RISK

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

JPMORGAN CHASES LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE MARKETS THAT BECOME ILLIQUID OR ARE OTHERWISE EXPERIENCING DISRUPTION, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER ENTITIES), DIFFICULTY IN SELLING OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS, UNFORESEEN OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL, AND LACK OF MARKET OR CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRM OR FINANCIAL MARKETS IN GENERAL. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL. THE WIDESPREAD CRISIS IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND RESULTING LIQUIDITY CRISIS EXPERIENCED IN 2008 AND INTO EARLY 2009 INCREASED THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDING AND LIMITED ITS ACCESS TO SOME OF ITS TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (SUCH AS SECURITIZED DEBT OFFERINGS BACKED BY MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS) DURING THAT TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE CONDITIONS COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IF THE FIRMS ACCESS TO STABLE AND LOW COST SOURCES OF FUNDING, SUCH AS BANK DEPOSITS, ARE REDUCED, THE FIRM MAY NEED TO RAISE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING WHICH MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE OR OF LIMITED AVAILABILITY.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH FLOW AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, ITS ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND SATISFY ITS DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION OR CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS THAT JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD REDUCE ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

SOME REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS REQUIRING LARGE BANKS TO INCORPORATE A SEPARATE SUBSIDIARY IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AND TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENT CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY FOR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES. IF ADOPTED, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD HINDER THE FIRMS ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE ITS FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER.

REDUCTIONS IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY AND COST OF FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., ARE CURRENTLY RATED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. IN 2013, MOODYS DOWNGRADED ITS RATINGS OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND SEVERAL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BASED ON MOODYS REASSESSMENT OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO IMPLICIT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SUCH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, AS OF YEAR-END 2013, S&P HAD JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. ON NEGATIVE OUTLOOK, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A DOWNGRADE IN RATINGS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRM CLOSELY MONITORS AND MANAGES FACTORS INFLUENCING ITS CREDIT RATINGS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH RATINGS WILL NOT BE LOWERED IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, THE RATING AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL TRENDS, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, RATING UPLIFT ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, FUTURE PROFITABILITY, RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LEGAL EXPENSES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO ADVERSE RATINGS ACTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH DOWNGRADES FROM RATING AGENCIES, IF THEY AFFECTED THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, WOULD NOT OCCUR AT TIMES OF BROADER MARKET INSTABILITY WHEN THE FIRMS OPTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO EVENTS MAY BE MORE LIMITED AND GENERAL INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

FURTHER, A REDUCTION IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS COULD REDUCE THE FIRMS ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS, MATERIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF ISSUING DEBT, TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF INVESTORS AND COUNTERPARTIES WILLING OR PERMITTED, CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE, TO DO BUSINESS WITH OR LEND TO THE FIRM, THEREBY CURTAILING THE FIRMS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REDUCING ITS PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, ANY SUCH REDUCTION IN CREDIT RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT SPREADS CHARGED BY THE MARKET FOR TAKING CREDIT RISK ON JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE ISSUED OR MAY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE.

12

LEGAL RISK

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES. ACTIONS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM. AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, AND AS NOTED ABOVE, THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS THE REGULATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRM AND ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL CONSENT ORDERS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ISSUED BY THEM IN THE FUTURE. THESE AND OTHER INITIATIVES FROM FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS MAY SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FURTHER JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES OR PENALTIES, OR CAUSE THE FIRM TO BE REQUIRED TO RESTRUCTURE ITS OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL ISSUES, OR HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FIRMS REVENUE.

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS

JPMORGAN CHASES OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS U.S. AND NON-U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATES THE SUPPLY OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES DETERMINE IN LARGE PART THE COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE RETURN EARNED ON THOSE LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN FEDERAL RESERVE POLICIES (AS WELL AS THE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES OF NON-U.S. CENTRAL BANKS OR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES) ARE BEYOND THE FIRMS CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES ON THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING AND MARKET-MAKING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH SUCH COMPANIES OPERATE, AS WELL AS THE OTHER RISKS AND CONSIDERATIONS AS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH, OR TRADE IN OBLIGATIONS OF, U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, INCLUDING NATIONAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES CAN EXPOSE THE FIRM TO ENHANCED SOVEREIGN, CREDIT-RELATED, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISKS THAT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY MAY DEFAULT ON OR RESTRUCTURE ITS OBLIGATIONS OR MAY CLAIM THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE BEYOND THE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THOSE OFFICIALS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH THE FIRM MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS PARTICULAR TO THOSE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS. IN SOME CASES, CONCERNS REGARDING THE FISCAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES CAN LEAD TO MARKET CONTAGION TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE SAME REGION OR BEYOND THE REGION. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM DOES NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY MAY BE HINDERED BY LOCAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND RISKS.

JPMORGAN CHASE HAS EXPANDED AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GROW ITS INTERNATIONAL WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IN EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA (EMEA), ASIA/PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA/CARIBBEAN OVER TIME.  AS PART OF ITS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY, THE FIRM SEEKS TO PROVIDE A WIDER RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO ITS CLIENTS THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THOSE REGIONS.

SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE CONDUCTS ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES HAVE ECONOMIES OR MARKETS THAT ARE LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE VOLATILE, AND MAY HAVE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE LESS ESTABLISHED OR PREDICTABLE, THAN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS IN WHICH THE FIRM CURRENTLY OPERATES. SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS, OR HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICIES SUCH AS CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THESE COUNTRIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO, SOCIAL UNREST, GENERAL STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, OUTBREAKS OF HOSTILITIES, OVERTHROW OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR OTHER FORMS OF INTERNAL DISCORD, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRIES. POLITICAL, SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION OR DISLOCATION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH THE FIRM CONDUCTS ITS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES CAN HINDER THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THOSE OPERATIONS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ITS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY.

13

PART I

LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES CAN ALSO HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS IN THOSE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY BASIS OR GUIDANCE FOR ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS OR TRANSACTIONS, OR THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OR INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; DIFFICULTY IN COMPETING IN ECONOMIES IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS OR PROTECTS ALL OR A PORTION OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY OR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES, OR WHERE GRAFT OR CORRUPTION MAY BE PERVASIVE; AND THE THREAT OF ARBITRARY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, CIVIL LITIGATIONS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.

REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS INCLUDING EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE FIRMS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES OFTEN REQUIRES THE FIRM TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO UNDERSTANDING, AND MONITORING CHANGES IN, LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING AND ADMINISTERING RELATED INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRM WILL ALWAYS BE SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS PREDICTABLE LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM CAN ALSO INCUR HIGHER COSTS, AND FACE GREATER COMPLIANCE RISKS, IN STRUCTURING ITS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO COMPLY WITH U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND LIABILITY.

JPMORGAN CHASE ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL, FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. THE FIRM IS ALSO ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION AND HAS INVESTED IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN WIND ENERGY AND IN SOURCING, DEVELOPING AND TRADING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE

ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY, AND TO RESTRICT SOME OF THE FIRMS ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES FROM THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. FURTHERMORE, LIABILITY MAY BE INCURRED WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATIONS.

THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ALSO FURTHER EXPOSE THE FIRM TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES, ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE FIRMS CONTROL, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE OF POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT, TRANSMISSION LINES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PROCESSES, AND THE CONTRACTUAL FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND DELIVER RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. THE FIRMS ACTIONS TO MITIGATE ITS RISKS RELATED TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONSIDERATIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND EMPLOYEES, AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES OF SUCH SYSTEMS OR MISCONDUCT BY SUCH EMPLOYEES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ONE OR MORE OF ITS EMPLOYEES CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAKDOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM CHANGES PROCESSES OR INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE FIRM MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DIMINISH THE FIRMS ABILITY TO

14

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER LITIGATION COSTS (INCLUDING FINES AND SANCTIONS), REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, REGULATORY INTERVENTION OR WEAKER COMPETITIVE STANDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, AS WELL AS RETAILERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS DO BUSINESS, CAN ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO SECURITY BREACHES AFFECTING SUCH PARTIES AND BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF THE SYSTEMS OR MISCONDUCT BY THE EMPLOYEES OF SUCH PARTIES. INCIDENTS OF THESE TYPES MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF ITS OWN OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS OR TO SAFEGUARD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR ITS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY INCREASING THE FIRMS OPERATIONAL COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DIMINISH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE FIRMS POSSESSION WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH INFORMATION WAS ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER THROUGH THE FAULT OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION WAS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND THE FIRMS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY BREACHES (AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW); ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES; FAILURES OF COMPUTER SERVERS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS PROPERTY OR ASSETS; NATURAL DISASTERS OR SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS; HEALTH EMERGENCIES OR PANDEMICS; OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICAL EVENTS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. JPMORGAN CHASE MAINTAINS A GLOBAL RESILIENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRM HAS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITS CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORTING ASSETS, INCLUDING STAFF, TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. WHILE THE FIRM BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT RESILIENCY PLANS ARE BOTH SUFFICIENT AND ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PLANS WILL FULLY MITIGATE ALL POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS TO THE FIRM. ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS COULD GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SUBJECTING THE FIRM TO LOSSES OR LIABILITY, OR REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE FAILURE OR DISRUPTION, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION, REGULATORY FINES OR PENALTIES OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

A BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES SYSTEMS COULD DISRUPT ITS BUSINESSES, RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DAMAGE ITS REPUTATION AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND LEGAL EXPOSURE FOR THE FIRM.

ALTHOUGH JPMORGAN CHASE DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND REGULARLY UPGRADE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FIRMS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ASSETS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION BELONGING TO THE FIRM AND ITS CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE FIRMS SECURITY MEASURES WILL PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. JPMORGAN CHASE AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS AND COMPANIES ENGAGED IN DATA PROCESSING HAVE REPORTED BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF THEIR WEBSITES OR OTHER SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE INVOLVED SOPHISTICATED AND TARGETED ATTACKS INTENDED TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DESTROY DATA, DISRUPT OR DEGRADE SERVICE, SABOTAGE SYSTEMS OR CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE, OFTEN THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALWARE, CYBERATTACKS AND OTHER MEANS. IN PARTICULAR, THE FIRM HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS FROM TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-RESOURCED THIRD PARTIES WHICH WERE INTENDED TO DISRUPT ONLINE BANKING SERVICES, AS WELL AS DATA BREACHES DUE TO CYBERATTACKS WHICH, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, HAVE RESULTED IN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CUSTOMER DATA.

DESPITE THE FIRMS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ITS SYSTEMS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE OR TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST ALL SECURITY BREACHES OF THESE TYPES, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES USED CHANGE FREQUENTLY OR ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL LAUNCHED, AND BECAUSE CYBERATTACKS CAN ORIGINATE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE THE FIRM SUCH AS PERSONS WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME OR ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR WHO MAY BE LINKED TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THOSE PARTIES MAY ALSO ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS OR OTHER USERS OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS TO DISCLOSE SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE FIRMS DATA OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS MOBILE-PAYMENT AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND EXPANDS ITS INTERNAL USAGE OF WEB-BASED PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS.

A SUCCESSFUL PENETRATION OR CIRCUMVENTION OF THE SECURITY OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRM, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, MISAPPROPRIATION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE FIRM OR THAT OF ITS CUSTOMERS, OR DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS OR SYSTEMS OF THE FIRM AND THOSE OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND COULD RESULT IN VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND OTHER LAWS, FINANCIAL LOSS TO THE FIRM OR TO ITS CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRMS SECURITY MEASURES, CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, SIGNIFICANT

15

PART I

LITIGATION EXPOSURE, AND HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION, ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FIRM.

RISK MANAGEMENT

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISKS AND ITS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING EVERY RISK TO THE FIRM, THEREBY RESULTING IN LOSSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. THE FIRM HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MEASURE, MONITOR, REPORT AND ANALYZE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT.  HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. ANY LAPSE IN THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR OTHER INADEQUACIES IN THE DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE, PROCEDURES OR PRACTICES COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES FOR THE FIRM, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE ANY RISK MANAGEMENT DEFICIENCY, ATTRACT HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT THE FIRM TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRMS REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

THE FIRMS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LOANS, LEASES, LENDING COMMITMENTS, DERIVATIVES, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE, AS WELL AS CASH MANAGEMENT AND CLEARING ACTIVITIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO CREDIT RISK. AS ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST LENDERS, THE FIRM HAS EXPOSURES ARISING FROM ITS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE FIRMS EXPOSURES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS EARNINGS. THE FIRM ESTABLISHES ALLOWANCES FOR PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE, INCLUDING UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS. THE FIRM ALSO EMPLOYS STRESS TESTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FIRM IN THE EVENT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET EVENTS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION, AND REQUIRE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF HOW ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MIGHT IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE FIRMS BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES TO REPAY THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENTS, THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE PROPER FACTORS OR THAT THE FIRM WILL FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF FACTORS THAT IT IDENTIFIES.

JPMORGAN CHASES MARKET-MAKING BUSINESSES MAY EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED MARKET, CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES. SEVERE DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES, UNANTICIPATED CREDIT EVENTS, OR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY CAUSE PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED FACTORS TO BECOME CORRELATED (AND VICE VERSA)

MAY CREATE LOSSES RESULTING FROM RISKS NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT, STRUCTURING OR PRICING OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT SUCH AS A DERIVATIVE. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT BY DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS THAT THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN; IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN SITUATIONS WHERE TRADES ARE NOT SETTLED OR CONFIRMED ON A TIMELY BASIS, THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT, THE FIRM MAY BE EXPOSED TO MARKET AND OPERATIONAL LOSSES. IN PARTICULAR, DISPUTES REGARDING THE TERMS OR THE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION, LEGAL AND LITIGATION COSTS, AND IMPAIR THE FIRMS ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

MANY OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OR TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORICAL MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF MARKET STRESS, OR IN THE EVENT OF OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. THESE SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED AND COULD AGAIN LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES.

MANY OF THE MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW NOT ONLY BY THE FIRMS MODEL RISK FUNCTION BUT ALSO BY THE FIRMS REGULATORS IN ORDER THAT THE FIRM MAY UTILIZE SUCH MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRMS CALCULATIONS OF MARKET RISK RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWA) AND CREDIT RISK RWA UNDER THE ADVANCED APPROACH OF BASEL III. THE FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER CAPITAL CHARGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS OR LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESSES, IF SUCH MODELS DO NOT RECEIVE APPROVAL BY ITS REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT THE FIRM HOLDS WITH RESPECT TO OPERATIONAL RISK, AS DERIVED FROM ITS OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL MODEL REQUIRED UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL STANDARDS, WILL

16

NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE, WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE FIRMS PROFITABILITY.

IN ADDITION, THE FIRM MUST COMPLY WITH ENHANCED STANDARDS FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH VENDORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE FIRM. THESE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THE FIRM BOTH UNDER GENERAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE BANKING REGULATORS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE CONSENT ORDER ENTERED INTO BY THE FIRM RELATING TO COLLECTIONS LITIGATION PRACTICES. THE FIRM HAS INCURRED AND EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSIGHT OF ITS THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. FAILURE BY THE FIRM TO APPROPRIATELY ASSESS AND MANAGE THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT BANKING FUNCTIONS, SHARED SERVICES OR OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES, COULD RESULT IN POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS IMPOSED BY THE FIRMS REGULATORS, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AND HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

LAPSES IN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS, PROFITABILITY OR REPUTATION.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OR THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING COULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN. ANY SUCH LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES, EXPOSE THE FIRM TO REGULATORY OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUBJECT IT TO FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS, HARM THE FIRMS REPUTATION, OR OTHERWISE CAUSE A DECLINE IN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

OTHER RISKS

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND JPMORGAN CHASES INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FIRM EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, HEDGE FUNDS, COMMODITY TRADING COMPANIES, PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES, INVESTMENT MANAGERS, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING

COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. THE FIRMS BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE FIRM CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPETITORS OF THE FIRMS NON-U.S. WHOLESALE BUSINESSES ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REGULATORY OBJECTIVES UNDERLYING SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION ON PROPRIETARY TRADING UNDER THE VOLCKER RULE AND THE DERIVATIVES PUSH-OUT RULES, HAVE NOT BEEN EMBRACED BY GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED INTO LAW IN MOST COUNTRIES. THE MORE RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JPMORGAN CHASE, CAN PUT THE FIRM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO ITS NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING THE FIRM FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE FIRMS PRICING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CLIENTS OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE FIRMS COST STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE THE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY OF THE FIRMS WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS, AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES EMPLOYEES ARE THE FIRMS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE, AND IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. THE IMPOSITION ON THE FIRM OR ITS EMPLOYEES OF RESTRICTIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES. IF THE FIRM IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE FIRMS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

17

PART I

JPMORGAN CHASES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, JPMORGAN CHASE IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MSRS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR DECLINES IN PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

DAMAGE TO JPMORGAN CHASES REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE ITS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING TRUST IN JPMORGAN CHASE IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. THE FIRMS REPUTATION COULD ALSO BE HARMED BY THE FAILURE OF AN AFFILIATE, JOINT-VENTURER OR MERCHANT BANKING PORTFOLIO COMPANY, OR A VENDOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS, TO COMPLY WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO DELIVER APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, OR A FAILURE OR PERCEIVED FAILURE TO TREAT CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS FAIRLY, CAN RESULT IN CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION, LITIGATION AND HEIGHTENED REGULATORY SCRUTINY, ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO LOST REVENUE, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION. ADVERSE PUBLICITY REGARDING THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRMS PROSPECTS. ACTIONS BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY OR BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OR INDIVIDUALS IN THE INDUSTRY CAN ALSO AFFECT THE FIRMS REPUTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SHOULD ANY OF THESE OR OTHER EVENTS OR FACTORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THE FIRMS REPUTATION OCCUR, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE FIRM MAY NEED TO INCUR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES GIVING

RISE TO THE REPUTATIONAL HARM COULD NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE FIRM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH MORE NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS AND INTERESTS WITH AND AMONG THE FIRMS CLIENTS. THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, OR THE PERCEIVED FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST COULD AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH THE FIRM, OR GIVE RISE TO LITIGATION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AS WELL AS CAUSE SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM TO THE FIRM.
