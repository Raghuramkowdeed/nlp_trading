ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 101. HOWEVER, FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW,

IN THE MD&A OR ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER OF THE FIRMS REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE SEC, ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM. THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS.

U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF

THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITIES PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; INFLATION; THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT; AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL

ECONOMIES ARE EXPANDING OR EXPERIENCING RECESSIONARY PRESSURES CAN AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO CAN AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. A MARKET DOWNTURN CAN LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FIRM

EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUE THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY REDUCES TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER TRADING REVENUE.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES, WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS OR LESS LIQUIDITY OR OTHER WEAKNESS IN THE MARKETS ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS THE FIRM MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS

OR INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED

INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS HELD BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE

AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITIES MARKETS; CREDIT SPREADS AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, AND OTHER

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS FACTORS. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUE RELATING TO ITS TRADING WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHER CONDITIONS COULD NOT

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS MANAGED BY, OR HELD IN CUSTODY OF, THE FIRM, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS REVENUE. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET OR SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OUTFLOWS

OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES

THE FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON AND OFFBALANCE SHEET ASSETS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN A POOR

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS

AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, OR REQUIREMENTS THAT THE FIRM PURCHASE ASSETS OR PROVIDE OTHER FUNDING, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SUCH CONDITIONS INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; HOUSING PRICES; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN

CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS. CERTAIN CHANGES TO THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN

ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DECLINES IN HOME PRICES, COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

SUDDEN ILLIQUIDITY IN MARKETS OR OTHER ABRUPT CHANGES IN MARKETS OR ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ANY OR ALL OF THE FIRMS BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN DECLINES

IN LIQUIDITY OR PRICES OF CERTAIN LOANS AND SECURITIES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE CERTAIN FIRM BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH VALUATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHANGE OR ADJUSTMENT AND COULD LEAD TO

DECLINES IN THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER

ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL

FUND COMPANIES, CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, SECURITIES PROCESSING COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A VARIETY OF

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NONDEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING. JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET

SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION ALSO MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSE OR MAY

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRE

THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN

ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

THE FIRM HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; THE OVERALL

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED ENTITY; OR IMPROVED PRICE FOR THE FIRMS COMMON STOCK. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT

CONTROLS, AS WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASES

MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS OR THAT ANY BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND WILL RESULT IN ALL OF THE POSITIVE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ITS ACQUISITIONS, THE

FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN

FAILURES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS, RECORD AND MONITOR A

LARGE NUMBER OF INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIRM IS SIMILARLY

DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF A FIRM EMPLOYEE CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY

MANIPULATES THE FIRMS OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAKDOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES.

ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION, ANY OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

FIRM.

IF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE FIRM WERE TO BE MISHANDLED OR MISUSED THE FIRM COULD

SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND FINANCIAL LOSS. SUCH MISHANDLING OR MISUSE COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF SUCH INFORMATION WERE ERRONEOUSLY PROVIDED TO PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PERMITTED TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EITHER

BY FAULT OF THE FIRMS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, OR COUNTERPARTIES, OR WHERE SUCH INFORMATION IS INTERCEPTED OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATELY TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE

FIRM MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER

DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR PHYSICAL ASSETS, OR EVENTS ARISING FROM LOCAL OR LARGER SCALE POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL

CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING THE FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO LITIGATION OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IN INVESTING AND TRADING IN SECURITIES OF COMPANIES

WORLDWIDE. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RISK OF LOSS FROM VARIOUS UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS,

EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS, PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. FURTHER, VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE FIRM OPERATES OR INVESTS, OR IN WHICH IT MAY DO SO IN THE

FUTURE, HAVE IN THE PAST EXPERIENCED SEVERE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING EXTREME CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, HIGH INFLATION, OR LOW OR NEGATIVE GROWTH, AMONG OTHER NEGATIVE CONDITIONS. CRIME, CORRUPTION AND A LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED LEGAL FRAMEWORK ARE

ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADING IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE

IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS SOME TRADING MARKETS ARE SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN LARGER MARKETS. ALSO, ANY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN ONE COUNTRY CAN, AND HAS IN THE PAST, AFFECTED FIRM

OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES.

THE EMERGENCE OF A WIDESPREAD HEALTH EMERGENCY OR PANDEMIC ALSO COULD CREATE ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL

DISRUPTION THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUE AND OPERATIONS OR IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD.

THUS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE FIRM WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ARISING FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL EVENTS.

DAMAGE

TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS BUSINESSES.

MAINTAINING A POSITIVE REPUTATION FOR THE FIRM IS CRITICAL TO THE FIRM ATTRACTING AND

MAINTAINING CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES. DAMAGE TO ITS REPUTATION CAN THEREFORE CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS. HARM TO THE FIRMS REPUTATION CAN ARISE FROM NUMEROUS SOURCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY OUTCOMES, FAILING TO DELIVER MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY, COMPLIANCE FAILURES, UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AND THE ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. FURTHER, NEGATIVE PUBLICITY REGARDING

THE FIRM, WHETHER OR NOT TRUE, MAY ALSO RESULT IN HARM TO THE FIRMS PROSPECTS.

THE FIRM COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM IF THE FIRM ACTS WHEN IT

HAS, OR IS THOUGHT TO HAVE, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE FIRM DOES NOT PROPERLY MANAGE AMONG ITS VARIOUS BUSINESSES

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

AND

ROLES THE FLOW OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION OF ITS CLIENTS, IT COULD SUFFER REPUTATIONAL HARM THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS THE

FIRM EXPANDS ITS ACTIVITIES AMONG ITS NUMEROUS TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS, HOLDINGS AND CLIENTS. THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CAUSE MATERIAL HARM TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS

AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT CAN GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

CERTAIN REGULATORS WHICH SUPERVISE THE FIRM HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER IN REVIEWING THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND

APPROVING ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THESE POWERS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE FIRM ENGAGES OR INTENDS TO ENGAGE. PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRMS BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED

REGULATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY, OFTEN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FIRM RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM EXPANDS ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS ACTIVITIES WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASING RANGE OF NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPOSE NEW

REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. FURTHER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE IS SUBJECT, OR THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE INTERPRETED OR

ENFORCED, WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT OR IS

OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN

JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR CAUSE IT SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM. PARTICULARLY AS A

PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, IT IS LIKELY THE FIRM WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO ITS BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS

PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES ARE ITS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL

IS INTENSE. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL AND OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES.

FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND INVESTING. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CURRENT AND

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE OR HAVE DIMINISHED DEMAND FOR THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ITS RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM.

THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND LOSS TO THE FIRM. TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK,

INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AS

THERE MAY EXIST, OR DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, RISKS THAT THE FIRM HAS NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED OR IDENTIFIED. IF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY OF THE FIRMS HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES HAVE A BASIS IN HISTORIC MARKET BEHAVIOR, AND ALL SUCH STRATEGIES

AND TECHNIQUES ARE BASED TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENTS SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MODELS USED BY THE FIRM ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CORRELATIONS AMONG PRICES OF VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES OR OTHER MARKET INDICATORS. IN TIMES OF

MARKET STRESS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, PREVIOUSLY UNCORRELATED INDICATORS MAY BECOME CORRELATED, OR CONVERSELY, PREVIOUSLY CORRELATED INDICATORS MAY MAKE UNRELATED MOVEMENTS. IN THE PAST, SUDDEN MARKET MOVEMENTS OR UNANTICIPATED OR

UNIDENTIFIED MARKET OR ECONOMIC MOVEMENTS HAVE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, CAUSING THE FIRM TO INCUR LOSSES. THIS MAY OCCUR AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES GROW AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED, MONITORED OR MANAGED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES, WILL AT ALL TIMES

BE ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE.

FINALLY, THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IN A DIFFICULT OR LESS LIQUID MARKET ENVIRONMENT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SAME OR SIMILAR STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE

FIRM TO REDUCE ITS RISK POSITIONS DUE TO THE ACTIVITY OF SUCH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS

COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE. A COMPROMISE TO THE

FIRMS LIQUIDITY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRM. SOME POTENTIAL CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE ILLIQUID OR VOLATILE MARKETS, DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH OR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COMMITMENTS TO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED) AND DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY TO SELL ASSETS. THESE CONDITIONS MAY BE CAUSED BY EVENTS OVER WHICH THE

FIRM HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN OR UNANTICIPATED CONTRACTION OF THE CREDIT OR OTHER MARKET OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. FURTHER, IN A PERIOD OF DIFFICULT CREDIT OR OTHER MARKETS, THE FIRM MAY BE FORCED TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS

AT A HIGHER COST OR IT MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE AS MUCH FUNDING AS IT NEEDS TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THIS COULD CAUSE THE FIRM TO CURTAIL ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHILE INCURRING HIGHER COSTS FOR FUNDING.

THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE FIRM AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. ARE IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A REDUCTION IN THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS, DEPENDING

ON THE SEVERITY, COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS OR COLLATERAL POSTING, AND PERMIT TERMINATION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS A PARTY. REDUCTION IN THE RATINGS OF CERTAIN

SPES OR OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THE FIRM HAS A FUNDING OR OTHER COMMITMENT COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY WHERE SUCH RATINGS CHANGES LEAD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE FIRM BEING REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ASSETS OR OTHERWISE

PROVIDE FUNDING.

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON THE EARNINGS OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS CASH FLOW AND CONSEQUENT ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND

SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS. THESE PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. SEVERAL OF THE FIRMS PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REGULATORY OR CONTRACTUAL

RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH PAYMENTS. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS THE FIRM RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY POSITION.

THE FIRM COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN A SITUATION IN WHICH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE FIRM COULD BE

AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS THAT DEAL WITH EACH OTHER ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY, OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE THE

FIRM HAS EXPOSURE TO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND COUNTERPARTIES, IT ROUTINELY EXECUTES A HIGH VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BROKERS AND DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, MUTUAL

AND HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY OVERALL. AS A RESULT, A DEFAULT BY, OR EVEN CONCERNS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS

COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS, OR LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE FIRM.

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS MAY

EXPOSE THE FIRM TO UNEXPECTED RISK AND POTENTIAL LOSSES.

THE FIRM IS PARTY TO NUMEROUS DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE

PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT OR DELIVERY OF SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS THE FIRM DOES NOT OWN. IF THE FIRM IS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE SECURITIES, COMMODITIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAME FOR DELIVERY, THIS COULD CAUSE

THE FIRM TO FORFEIT PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO IT AND COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENT DELAYS WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE FIRMS REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO TRANSACT FUTURE BUSINESS.

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

ENTERED INTO WITH THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFIRMED BY COUNTERPARTIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. WHILE A TRANSACTION REMAINS UNCONFIRMED, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED CREDIT AND OPERATIONAL RISK AND IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT THE FIRM MAY FIND THE

CONTRACT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. IN ADDITION, AS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE CREATED, DISPUTES REGARDING THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS COULD ARISE, WHICH COULD FORCE THE FIRM TO INCUR UNEXPECTED COSTS AND IMPAIR ITS

ABILITY TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY ITS RISK EXPOSURES FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

THE FIRMS COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, POTENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND REGULATION THAT MAY EXPOSE IT TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND LIABILITY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMODITIES ACTIVITIES OF

THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANK, THE FIRM ENGAGES IN THE STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF SEVERAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING METALS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, OIL PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRIC POWER, EMISSION CREDITS, COAL,

FREIGHT, AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND INDICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE FIRM IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND EVOLVING ENERGY, COMMODITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FIRM EXPECTS LAWS AND REGULATIONS

AFFECTING ITS COMMODITIES BUSINESS TO EXPAND IN SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. THE FIRM MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN COMPLYING WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES. THE FIRMS COMMODITIES BUSINESS ALSO FURTHER EXPOSES IT TO THE RISK OF UNFORESEEN AND CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, LEAKS, SPILLS, EXPLOSIONS, RELEASE OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, FIRES,

ACCIDENTS ON LAND AND AT SEA, WARS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS. THE FIRM ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE ITS RISKS BUT ITS ACTIONS MAY NOT PROVE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS

EVERY CONTINGENCY. IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COVERING SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, AND THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM INSURANCE RECOVERY MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INCIDENTS. AS A RESULT, THE

FIRMS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED IN PART ON

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WHICH, IF WRONG, COULD CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING IN DETERMINING CREDIT LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO LITIGATIONS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. IF ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE INCORRECT, THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL LOSSES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRM MAKES JUDGMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS OF ITS SPES. IF IT IS LATER DETERMINED THAT NON-CONSOLIDATED SPES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED, THIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, RELATED FUNDING, REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL RATIOS AND, IF THE SPES ASSETS INCLUDE UNREALIZED LOSSES, COULD REQUIRE THE FIRM TO RECOGNIZE THOSE LOSSES.

CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (AFS) SECURITIES, CERTAIN LOANS, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS), PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, STRUCTURED

NOTES AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REQUIRE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUE IN ORDER TO PREPARE THE FIRMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHERE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE FIRM MAY MAKE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATIONS BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS OR OTHER MEANS WHICH ULTIMATELY RELY TO SOME DEGREE ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. SOME OF THESE AND OTHER FIRM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MAY HAVE NO DIRECT OBSERVABLE PRICE LEVELS, MAKING THEIR VALUATION

PARTICULARLY SUBJECTIVE, BEING BASED ON SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATION AND JUDGMENT.
