ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SETS FORTH SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

THE FIRMS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS BESIDES THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW OR

ELSEWHERE IN THIS OR OTHER OF THE FIRMS REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED WITH THE

SEC ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS OR RESULTS. THE READER SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY

DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT MAY FACE THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS GENERALLY BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. FACTORS SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY OF THE

GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS; THE LEVEL AND VOLATILITY OF EQUITY PRICES; INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITIES

PRICES; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; INFLATION; AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECT THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF CLIENTS WITH RESPECT TO SIZE, NUMBER AND TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING THE FIRMS INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS UNDERWRITING AND ADVISORY

BUSINESSES. THESE FACTORS ALSO MAY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF CASH RETURNS FROM THE FIRMS PRIVATE

EQUITY BUSINESS. A MARKET DOWNTURN WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS

THAT THE FIRM EXECUTES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE REVENUES IT

RECEIVES FROM TRADING COMMISSIONS AND SPREADS. IN ADDITION, LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY WILL REDUCE

TRADING AND ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER TRADING REVENUES. HIGHER INTEREST

RATES OR WEAKNESS IN THE MARKETS ALSO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF UNDERWRITINGS

THE FIRM MANAGES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS OR INVESTORS

TO PARTICIPATE IN LOAN SYNDICATIONS OR UNDERWRITINGS MANAGED BY JPMORGAN CHASE.

THE FIRM GENERALLY MAINTAINS LARGE TRADING PORTFOLIOS IN THE FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND

EQUITY MARKETS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING MERCHANT BANKING INVESTMENTS

HELD BY ITS PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS. THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MARK-TO-MARKET VALUES OF THE FIRMS

BUSINESS ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS CREDIT STANDING; ITS SUCCESS IN PROPRIETARY

POSITIONING; VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY AND DEBT MARKETS; AND OTHER ECONOMIC AND

BUSINESS FACTORS. JPMORGAN CHASE ANTICIPATES THAT REVENUES RELATING TO ITS TRADING WILL EXPERIENCE

VOLATILITY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH VOLATILITY RELATING TO THE ABOVE FACTORS OR

OTHER CONDITIONS COULD NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FEES JPMORGAN CHASE EARNS FOR MANAGING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A HIGHER LEVEL OF U.S. OR NON-U.S. INTEREST RATES OR A DOWNTURN

IN TRADING MARKETS COULD AFFECT THE VALUATIONS OF THE THIRD-PARTY ASSETS MANAGED BY THE FIRM,

WHICH, IN TURN, COULD AFFECT THE FIRMS REVENUES. MOREOVER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET

DOWNTURN, BELOW-MARKET PERFORMANCE BY JPMORGAN CHASES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES COULD

RESULT IN OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE THE FEES THE

FIRM RECEIVES.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF JPMORGAN CHASES ON-BALANCE SHEET AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ASSETS MAY BE

AFFECTED BY BUSINESS CONDITIONS. IN A POOR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT

MORE OF THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES COULD BECOME DELINQUENT ON THEIR LOANS OR OTHER

OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE WHICH, IN TURN, COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THE FIRMS CONSUMER BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH CAN

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT SUCH BUSINESSES AND THE FIRM.

4

SUCH CONDITIONS INCLUDE U.S. INTEREST RATES; THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT; THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE; CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING; AND THE NUMBER OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AMONG OTHERS.

CERTAIN CHANGES TO THESE CONDITIONS CAN DIMINISH DEMAND FOR BUSINESSES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR

INCREASE THE COST TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, A DETERIORATION IN CONSUMERS

CREDIT QUALITY COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN LOAN DELINQUENCIES AND HIGHER NET CHARGE-OFFS, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS EARNINGS.

THERE IS INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

JPMORGAN CHASES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPECTS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS TO

CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY AS CONTINUED MERGER ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY PRODUCES

LARGER, BETTER-CAPITALIZED AND MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY-DIVERSE COMPANIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OFFERING A

WIDER ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT MORE COMPETITIVE PRICES.

THE FIRM ALSO FACES AN INCREASING ARRAY OF COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER BANKS, BROKERAGE

FIRMS, INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANIES, MERCHANT BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES,

CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, MORTGAGE BANKING COMPANIES, HEDGE FUNDS, TRUST COMPANIES, AUTOMOBILE

FINANCING COMPANIES, LEASING COMPANIES, E-COMMERCE AND OTHER INTERNET-BASED COMPANIES, AND A

VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ADVISORY COMPANIES. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THE GROWTH

OF E-COMMERCE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE BANKING PRODUCTS, AND FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES TO

PROVIDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET-BASED FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES GENERALLY COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF THE QUALITY AND VARIETY OF ITS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TRANSACTION EXECUTION, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY, REPUTATION AND PRICE. ONGOING

OR INCREASED COMPETITION IN ANY ONE OR ALL OF THESE AREAS MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR

THE FIRMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR MAY CAUSE THE FIRM TO LOSE MARKET SHARE. INCREASED COMPETITION

MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE FIRM TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ITS BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, WHICH INVESTMENTS MAY INCREASE EXPENSES, OR WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE FIRM TO EXTEND MORE

OF ITS CAPITAL ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS IN ORDER TO EXECUTE LARGER, MORE COMPETITIVE TRANSACTIONS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT JPMORGAN CHASES FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASES ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT RESULT IN ALL OF THE

BENEFITS ANTICIPATED.

THE FIRM HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE SEEK TO GROW ITS BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING OTHER

BUSINESSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS ACQUISITIONS WILL HAVE THE ANTICIPATED

POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING RESULTS RELATING TO: THE TOTAL COST OF INTEGRATION; THE TIME REQUIRED

TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATION; THE AMOUNT OF LONGER-TERM COST SAVINGS; OR THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF

THE COMBINED ENTITY. INTEGRATION OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, SOMETIMES

INCLUDING COMBINING RELEVANT ACCOUNTING AND DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, AS

WELL AS MANAGING RELEVANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, AS

WELL AS WITH EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT JPMORGAN CHASES MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS OR THAT ANY BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND WILL RESULT IN ALL OF THE POSITIVE

BENEFITS ANTICIPATED. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ITS PAST AND ANY

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, THERE IS THE RISK THE FIRMS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

JPMORGAN CHASE RELIES ON ITS SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, AND CERTAIN FAILURES

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS A LARGE NUMBER OF INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. IF ANY OF THE FIRMS FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, OR OTHER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS

FAIL OR HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS, THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE

FIRM IS SIMILARLY DEPENDENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THE FIRM COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF A

FIRM EMPLOYEE CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BREAK-DOWN OR FAILURE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF HUMAN

ERROR OR WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL PURPOSEFULLY SABOTAGES OR FRAUDULENTLY MANIPULATES THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS. THIRD PARTIES WITH WHICH THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS COULD ALSO BE SOURCES OF

OPERATIONAL RISK TO THE FIRM, INCLUDING RELATING TO BREAK-DOWNS OR FAILURES OF SUCH PARTIES OWN

SYSTEMS OR EMPLOYEES. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED ABILITY OF THE FIRM TO

OPERATE ONE OR MORE OF ITS BUSINESSES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO CLIENTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE AND

REGULATORY INTERVENTION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRM.

THE FIRM MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARISING FROM EVENTS THAT ARE

WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY BEYOND ITS CONTROL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER VIRUSES OR

ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES OR NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANE KATRINA, OR EVENTS

ARISING FROM LOCAL OR REGIONAL POLITICS, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY GIVE RISE

TO LOSSES IN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND LOSS OR LIABILITY TO THE FIRM.

IN A FIRM AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS JPMORGAN CHASE, LAPSES OR DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT

SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

IN ADDITION THERE IS THE RISK THAT THE FIRMS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS BUSINESS

CONTINUITY AND DATA SECURITY SYSTEMS PROVE TO BE INADEQUATE. ANY SUCH FAILURE COULD AFFECT THE

FIRMS OPERATIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REQUIRING THE

FIRM TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CORRECT THE DEFECT, AS WELL AS BY EXPOSING THE FIRM TO

LITIGATION OR LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

JPMORGAN CHASES NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS.

THE FIRM DOES BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD COMMONLY

KNOWN AS EMERGING MARKETS. IN THE PAST MANY EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING DEVALUATIONS OF THEIR CURRENCIES AND CAPITAL AND

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AS WELL AS LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF

LOSS FROM VARIOUS UNFAVORABLE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OR POLICIES OF CENTRAL BANKS,

EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, CONFISCATION OF ASSETS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATING TO

NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP.

THE FIRM ALSO INVESTS IN THE SECURITIES OF CORPORATIONS LOCATED IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS,

INCLUDING EMERGING MARKETS. REVENUES FROM THE TRADING OF NON-U.S. SECURITIES ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO

NEGATIVE FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS

COULD BE ACCENTUATED AS NON-U.S. TRADING MARKETS (PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS) ARE USUALLY

SMALLER, LESS LIQUID AND MORE VOLATILE THAN U.S. TRADING MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE

FIRM WILL NOT SUFFER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ARISING FROM ITS NON-U.S. TRADING ACTIVITIES OR

OPERATIONS.

PART I

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE CONDUCT OF ITS

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ITS REPUTATION COULD BE DAMAGED, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS

BUSINESS.

THE FIRMS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACT WITH ITS COUNTER-PARTIES COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT ITS REPUTATION IS DAMAGED. THE FAILURE OF THE FIRM TO DEAL, OR TO

APPEAR TO FAIL TO DEAL, WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE RISE TO REPUTATIONAL RISK COULD CAUSE

HARM TO THE FIRM AND ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

APPROPRIATELY DEALING WITH POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

ETHICAL ISSUES, MONEY-LAUNDERING, PRIVACY, RECORD-KEEPING, SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES, AND THE

PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN

ITS PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY THESE ISSUES COULD MAKE THE FIRMS CLIENTS

UNWILLING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FIRM, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS RESULTS.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS AND RESULTS ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.

JPMORGAN CHASE OPERATES WITHIN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS

SUBJECT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FIRMS OPERATIONS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH

IT CAN GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

CERTAIN REGULATORS TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER IN REVIEWING THE FIRMS

OPERATIONS AND APPROVING ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS, THE FIRMS

BUSINESSES HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED REGULATION AND REGULATORY SCRUTINY, OFTEN REQUIRING

ADDITIONAL FIRM RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, AS THE FIRM EXPANDS ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ITS

ACTIVITIES WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASING RANGE OF NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT WILL

LIKELY IMPOSE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN OF THE FIRMS OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH JPMORGAN CHASE IS

SUBJECT, OR THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE INTERPRETED OR ENFORCED, WILL NOT

HAVE A NEGATIVE AFFECT ON THE FIRMS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

JPMORGAN CHASE FACES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL RISKS, BOTH FROM REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

AND FROM PRIVATE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASE IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER

LITIGATION OR DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY

REGULATORY AGENCIES. THESE OR OTHER FUTURE ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST THE FIRM MAY RESULT IN

JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER RESULTS ADVERSE TO THE FIRM WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATION, OR

CAUSE IT SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL HARM.

JPMORGAN CHASES ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

ITS BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO DO SO MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS PERFORMANCE.

THE FIRMS EMPLOYEES ARE ITS MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE AND, IN MANY AREAS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IS INTENSE. IF JPMORGAN CHASE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE

TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ITS PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION,

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE AFFECT ON

JPMORGAN CHASES BUSINESSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FIRMS BUSINESSES AND EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FISCAL OR OTHER POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INFLUENCE, DIRECTLY

AND INDIRECTLY, THE RATE OF INTEREST PAID BY COMMERCIAL BANKS ON THEIR INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS

AND ALSO MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE FIRM. THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD ALSO DETERMINE TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE THE FIRMS COST OF FUNDS FOR LENDING AND

INVESTING. IN ADDITION, THESE POLICIES AND CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FIRMS CUSTOMERS AND

COUNTERPARTIES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT SUCH

CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO JPMORGAN CHASE.

JPMORGAN CHASES FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ITS RISKS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING RISK AND LOSS

TO THE FIRM.

JPMORGAN CHASES RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MADE UP OF VARIOUS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE

THE FIRMS RISK EXPOSURE. TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH THE FIRM IS SUBJECT INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, CREDIT

RISK, MARKET RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND REPUTATION RISK, FIDUCIARY RISK

AND PRIVATE EQUITY RISK, AMONG OTHERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FIRMS FRAMEWORK TO

MANAGE RISK, INCLUDING SUCH FRAMEWORKS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, WILL BE EFFECTIVE UNDER ALL

CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. IF THE FIRMS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVES INEFFECTIVE, THE FIRM

COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF JPMORGAN CHASE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS LIQUIDITY, ITS BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE ITS BUSINESSES, GROW AND BE PROFITABLE.

A COMPROMISE TO THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY COULD THEREFORE HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE FIRM. POTENTIAL

CONDITIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY INCLUDE

DIMINISHED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, UNFORESEEN CASH OR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND AN INABILITY TO

SELL ASSETS.

THE FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MAINTAINING ITS LIQUIDITY, AS A REDUCTION IN THE

FIRMS CREDIT RATINGS WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FIRMS LIQUIDITY. A CREDIT RATINGS

DOWNGRADE, DEPENDING ON ITS SEVERITY, COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE BORROWING COSTS, LIMIT ACCESS TO

CAPITAL MARKETS, REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS OR COLLATERAL POSTING, AND PERMIT TERMINATION OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTS MATERIAL TO THE FIRM.

FUTURE EVENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE ANTICIPATED BY JPMORGAN CHASES MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS

AND ESTIMATES, WHICH MAY CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.

PURSUANT TO U.S. GAAP, THE FIRM IS REQUIRED TO USE CERTAIN ESTIMATES IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE LOAN LOSS RESERVES, RESERVES RELATED TO

FUTURE LITIGATION, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. SHOULD

THE FIRMS DETERMINED VALUES FOR SUCH ITEMS PROVE SUBSTANTIALLY INACCURATE THE FIRM MAY EXPERIENCE

UNEXPECTED LOSSES WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.
