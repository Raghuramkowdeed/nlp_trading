TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY

OUR STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK IS FOUNDED ON OUR THREE-LEGGED STOOL OF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT AUTHORITY, AND PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY DRIVEN BY EFFECTIVE CAPITAL ALLOCATION, ALL UNITED BY THE GOAL OF PROVIDING AN INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE TO DRIVE VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR ASSOCIATES, OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING, AND OUR GOAL IS TO BECOME MORE AGILE IN RESPONDING TO THE CHANGING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. AS CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO BUY HOW, WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT, WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS, FEATURING INNOVATIVE AND CURATED PRODUCT CHOICES DELIVERED IN A FAST AND COST-EFFICIENT MANNER, WILL BE A KEY ENABLER FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.

BECOMING A BEST-IN-CLASS INTERCONNECTED RETAILER IS GROWING IN IMPORTANCE AS THE LINE BETWEEN ONLINE AND IN-STORE SHOPPING CONTINUES TO BLUR AND CUSTOMERS DEMAND INCREASED CONVENIENCE AND VALUE. UNDER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONNECTING OUR ASSOCIATES TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND CONNECTING OUR STORES TO OUR ONLINE EXPERIENCE. UNDER PRODUCT AUTHORITY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONNECTING OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, INCLUDING OFFERING LOCAL AND CUSTOMIZED ASSORTMENTS TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. UNDER PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONNECTING OUR MERCHANDISE FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR CUSTOMERS BY OPTIMIZING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. OVERALL, WE ARE COLLABORATING MORE CLOSELY THROUGHOUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND WITH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS TO BUILD AN INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS THAT OFFERS AN END-TO-END SOLUTION FOR THEIR HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES. OUR COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A KEY PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE INCLUDES MORE THAN JUST CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN OUR STORES, ONLINE, ON THE JOB SITE OR IN THEIR HOMES.

OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS, AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO MEET THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS.

•

DO-IT-YOURSELF ("DIY") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. OUR ASSOCIATES ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS WITH SPECIFIC PRODUCT AND INSTALLATION QUESTIONS BOTH IN OUR STORES AND THROUGH ONLINE RESOURCES AND OTHER MEDIA DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PRODUCT AND PROJECT KNOWLEDGE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF CLINICS AND WORKSHOPS BOTH TO IMPART THIS KNOWLEDGE AND TO BUILD AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR DIY CUSTOMERS.

•

DO-IT-FOR-ME ("DIFM") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT OR INSTALLATION. OUR STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION SERVICES AVAILABLE TO DIFM CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS FROM US IN OUR STORES, ONLINE OR IN THEIR HOMES THROUGH IN-HOME CONSULTATIONS. OUR INSTALLATION PROGRAMS INCLUDE MANY CATEGORIES, SUCH AS FLOORING, CABINETS, COUNTERTOPS, WATER HEATERS AND SHEDS. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE THIRD-PARTY PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION IN A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES SOLD THROUGH OUR IN-HOME SALES PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ROOFING, SIDING, WINDOWS, CABINET REFACING, FURNACES AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS. THIS CUSTOMER GROUP IS GROWING DUE TO CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL INCREASE DEMAND FOR OUR INSTALLATION SERVICES. FURTHER, OUR FOCUS ON SERVING THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, OR "PROS", WHO PERFORM THESE SERVICES FOR OUR DIFM CUSTOMERS WILL HELP US DRIVE HIGHER PRODUCT SALES.

•

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS

. THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY PROFESSIONAL RENOVATORS/REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, HANDYMEN, PROPERTY MANAGERS, BUILDING SERVICE CONTRACTORS AND SPECIALTY TRADESMEN, SUCH AS INSTALLERS. WE RECOGNIZE THE GREAT VALUE OUR PRO CUSTOMERS PROVIDE TO THEIR CLIENTS, AND WE STRIVE TO MAKE THE PRO’S JOB EASIER. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER OUR PROS A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED SALES AND SERVICE STAFF, ENHANCED CREDIT PROGRAMS, DESIGNATED PARKING SPACES CLOSE TO STORE ENTRANCES AND BULK PRICING PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ONLINE AND IN-STORE PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A LOYALTY PROGRAM, PRO XTRA, THAT PROVIDES OUR PROS WITH DISCOUNTS ON USEFUL BUSINESS SERVICES, EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT OFFERS AND A PURCHASE TRACKING TOOL TO ENABLE RECEIPT LOOKUP ONLINE AND JOB TRACKING OF PURCHASES ACROSS ALL FORMS OF PAYMENT.

WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF INTERLINE BRANDS, INC. ("INTERLINE") IN AUGUST 2015, WE ESTABLISHED A PLATFORM IN THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATIONS ("MRO") MARKET WHERE WE SERVE PRIMARILY INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS (SUCH AS EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS), HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES, AND NATIONAL APARTMENT COMPLEXES. WE ALSO GAINED ADDITIONAL COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO OUR LARGE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE SALES AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT, EXPANDED ASSORTMENT OF PRODUCT, EXPANDED FINANCING OPTIONS AND LAST MILE DELIVERY CAPABILITIES.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PROS HAVE DIFFERING NEEDS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF WORK THEY PERFORM. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CAPABILITIES FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS ACROSS EVERY PURCHASE OPPORTUNITY, SUCH AS SUPPLYING BOTH RECURRING MRO NEEDS AND RENOVATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROPERTY MANAGERS OR PROVIDING INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR SPECIALTY TRADESMEN’S REPLENISHMENT NEEDS. WE BELIEVE THAT BY BRINGING OUR BEST RESOURCES TO BEAR FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER, WE CAN PROVIDE A DIFFERENTIATED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND ENHANCED VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

WE HELP OUR DIY, DIFM AND PRO CUSTOMERS FINANCE THEIR PROJECTS BY OFFERING PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS. OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT PROGRAM INCLUDES OTHER BENEFITS, SUCH AS A 365-DAY RETURN POLICY AND, FOR OUR PROS, COMMERCIAL FUEL REWARDS AND EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS. IN FISCAL

2016

, OUR CUSTOMERS OPENED APPROXIMATELY 4.2 MILLION NEW THE HOME DEPOT PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT ACCOUNTS, AND AT FISCAL YEAR END THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION. PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 23% OF SALES IN FISCAL

2016.

OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ASSOCIATES ARE KEY TO OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE EMPOWER OUR ASSOCIATES TO DELIVER EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND WE STRIVE TO REMOVE COMPLEXITY AND INEFFICIENT PROCESSES FROM THE STORES TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO FOCUS ON OUR CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL

2016

, WE CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT NEW INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE FREIGHT HANDLING IN THE STORES, AS WELL AS PROJECT SYNC, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW UNDER "LOGISTICS". ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE OUR FREIGHT HANDLING PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT, WHICH ALLOWS OUR ASSOCIATES TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND MAKES WORKING AT THE HOME DEPOT A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR THEM. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TO RECOGNIZE STORES AND INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AT THE END OF FISCAL

2016

, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 406,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 27,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE. WE MEASURE ASSOCIATE SATISFACTION REGULARLY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE VERY GOOD.

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL.

IN FISCAL

2016

, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS’ INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCES THROUGH A VARIETY OF INITIATIVES. OUR ASSOCIATES CONTINUED TO USE FIRST PHONES, OUR WEB-ENABLED HANDHELD DEVICES, TO HELP CUSTOMERS COMPLETE ONLINE SALES IN THE AISLE, EXPEDITE THE CHECKOUT PROCESS FOR CUSTOMERS DURING PEAK TRAFFIC PERIODS, LOCATE PRODUCTS IN THE AISLES AND ONLINE, AND CHECK INVENTORY ON HAND. WE HAVE ALSO EMPOWERED OUR CUSTOMERS WITH IMPROVED PRODUCT LOCATION AND INVENTORY AVAILABILITY TOOLS ON OUR WEBSITE AND MOBILE APP. DURING FISCAL

2016

, WE LAUNCHED A REDESIGN OF OUR WEBSITE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH BETTER SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND A FASTER CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE, AND WE UPGRADED OUR MOBILE APP. ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR ONLINE AND MOBILE PROPERTIES ARE CRITICAL FOR OUR INCREASINGLY INTERCONNECTED CUSTOMERS WHO RESEARCH PRODUCTS ONLINE AND THEN GO INTO ONE OF OUR STORES TO VIEW THE PRODUCTS IN PERSON OR TALK TO AN ASSOCIATE BEFORE MAKING THE PURCHASE. WHILE IN THE STORE, CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO GO ONLINE TO ACCESS RATINGS AND REVIEWS, COMPARE PRICES, VIEW OUR EXTENDED ASSORTMENT AND PURCHASE PRODUCTS.

WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT CUSTOMERS DESIRE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO RECEIVING THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE STRIVE TO DELIVER ON THIS CUSTOMER EXPECTATION BY BLENDING THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL CHANNELS INTO A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS STRATEGY IS ENABLED THROUGH OUR NEW CUSTOMER ORDER MANAGEMENT PLATFORM ("COM"), WHICH WE ROLLED OUT TO ALL U.S. STORES IN FISCAL

2016

. COM PROVIDES A COMMON MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS, PROVIDING GREATER VISIBILITY AND A MORE SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. COM ALSO PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ENHANCED DELIVERY OPTION WE ROLLED OUT TO ALL U.S. STORES IN FISCAL

2016

: BUY ONLINE, DELIVER FROM STORE ("BODFS"). BODFS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO SCHEDULE A SPECIFIC DELIVERY WINDOW, AND IT COMPLEMENTS OUR EXISTING INTERCONNECTED RETAIL PROGRAMS: BUY ONLINE, PICK-UP IN STORE ("BOPIS"), BUY ONLINE, SHIP TO STORE ("BOSS") AND BUY ONLINE, RETURN IN STORE ("BORIS"). DURING THE YEAR, WE ALSO ENABLED A DYNAMIC ETA (ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL) FEATURE FOR ONLINE ORDERS, WHICH PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE DELIVERY DATE BASED ON THEIR LOCATION.

WE DO NOT VIEW THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AS A SPECIFIC TRANSACTION; RATHER, IT ENCOMPASSES AN ENTIRE PROCESS FROM INSPIRATION AND KNOW-HOW, TO PURCHASE AND FULFILLMENT, TO POST-PURCHASE CARE AND SUPPORT. FURTHER, WE BELIEVE THAT BY CONNECTING OUR STORES TO ONLINE AND ONLINE TO OUR STORES, WE DRIVE SALES NOT JUST IN-STORE BUT ALSO ONLINE. IN FISCAL

2016

, WE SAW INCREASED TRAFFIC TO OUR ONLINE PROPERTIES AND IMPROVED ONLINE SALES CONVERSION RATES. SALES FROM OUR ONLINE CHANNELS INCREASED OVER 19% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2015. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BLEND OUR PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL ASSETS IN A SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS WAY TO ENHANCE THE END-TO-END CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING OUR END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK AND IMPROVING OUR INVENTORY, TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTIVITY.

LOGISTICS.

WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN BY OPTIMIZING OUR NETWORK THROUGH INITIATIVES LIKE SUPPLY CHAIN SYNCHRONIZATION, OR "PROJECT SYNC". AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW, PROJECT SYNC IS A RECENT INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE OUR IN-STOCK RATES, INVENTORY PRODUCTIVITY AND LOGISTICS COSTS. DURING FISCAL 2016, WE ROLLED OUT THE FIRST PHASE OF PROJECT SYNC TO ALL U.S. STORES, AND WE CONTINUE TO ONBOARD NEW SUPPLIERS. THIS IS A MULTI-YEAR, MULTI-PHASE ENDEAVOR, WHICH WE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT IN EACH OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FLOW PATHS.

OUR OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL FLOW PATH FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT. RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS ("RDCS") PLAY A KEY ROLE IN OPTIMIZING OUR NETWORK AS THEY ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF PRODUCT NEEDS FOR MULTIPLE STORES TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON ARRIVAL AT THE RDC. THIS RESULTS IN A SIMPLIFIED ORDERING PROCESS AND IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. THROUGH PROJECT SYNC, WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR AVERAGE LEAD TIME FROM SUPPLIER TO SHELF. PROJECT SYNC REQUIRES DEEP COLLABORATION AMONG OUR SUPPLIERS, TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS, RDCS AND STORES, AS WELL AS RIGOROUS PLANNING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE AN ENGINEERED FLOW SCHEDULE THAT SHORTENS AND STABILIZES LEAD TIME, RESULTING IN MORE PREDICTABLE AND CONSISTENT FREIGHT FLOW. AS WE CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT PROJECT SYNC THROUGHOUT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WE PLAN TO CREATE AN END-TO-END SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS ALL PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO OUR RDC AND STORE ASSOCIATES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE CENTRALIZED OUR INVENTORY PLANNING AND REPLENISHMENT FUNCTION AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED OUR FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS HAS HELPED US IMPROVE OUR PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND OUR

TO BETTER SERVE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER A VARIETY OF DELIVERY METHODS TO GET PRODUCT TO EACH CUSTOMER’S PREFERRED LOCATION. WE COMPLETED THE ROLLOUT OF THREE NEW U.S. DFCS IN FISCAL 2015 TO SUPPORT OUR ONLINE GROWTH. WE ALSO OPERATE ONE DFC FOR OUR HOME DECORATORS COLLECTION ORDERS AND ONE DFC FOR "BIG AND BULKY" ORDERS. OUR DFCS ENABLE US TO REDUCE DELIVERY COSTS AND LEAD TIME, AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BY SHIPPING ONLINE ORDERS DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF INTERLINE IN FISCAL 2015, WE ADDED MORE THAN 100 DISTRIBUTION POINTS WITH FAST DELIVERY OF A BROAD ASSORTMENT OF MRO PRODUCTS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO LEVERAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITIES TO FULLY UTILIZE AND OPTIMIZE OUR IMPROVED LOGISTICS NETWORK.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISTRIBUTION AND FULFILLMENT CENTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE LEVERAGE OUR ALMOST 2,000 U.S. STORES AS A NETWORK OF CONVENIENT CUSTOMER PICK-UP, RETURN AND DELIVERY FULFILLMENT LOCATIONS. FOR CUSTOMERS WHO SHOP ONLINE AND WISH TO PICK-UP OR RETURN MERCHANDISE AT OUR U.S. STORES, WE HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED OUR BOPIS, BOSS AND BORIS PROGRAMS, WHICH WE BELIEVE PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2016, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR ONLINE U.S. ORDERS WERE PICKED UP IN A STORE. FOR CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD LIKE THE OPTION TO HAVE STORE-BASED ORDERS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THEIR HOME OR JOB SITE, WE PICK, PACK AND SHIP ORDERS TO CUSTOMERS FROM OUR STORES. OUR BODFS PROGRAM, WHICH WE ROLLED OUT IN FISCAL 2016, ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SELECT THEIR PREFERRED DELIVERY DATE AND TIME WINDOWS FOR STORE-BASED DELIVERIES. OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS STRATEGIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS HIGH PRODUCT AVAILABILITY WITH CONVENIENT AND LOW COST FULFILLMENT OPTIONS.

COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS.

THE HOME DEPOT FOCUSES ON SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS AND IS COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING ENERGY USAGE, SUPPLY CHAIN AND PACKAGING, STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, AND, AS NOTED ABOVE UNDER "ENVIRONMENTALLY-PREFERRED PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS", PRODUCT SELECTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAMS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

IN 2015, WE ANNOUNCED TWO MAJOR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS FOR 2020. OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO REDUCE OUR U.S. STORES’ ENERGY USE BY 20% OVER 2010 LEVELS, AND OUR SECOND GOAL IS TO PRODUCE AND PROCURE, ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, 135 MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY FOR OUR STORES THROUGH RENEWABLE OR ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS WIND, SOLAR AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2016, WE ARE ON TRACK TO EXCEED BOTH OF OUR GOALS BEFORE THE END OF 2020. WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING STRICT OPERATIONAL STANDARDS THAT ESTABLISH ENERGY EFFICIENT OPERATIONS IN ALL OF OUR U.S. FACILITIES AND CONTINUING TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY.

ADDITIONALLY, WE IMPLEMENTED A RAINWATER RECLAMATION PROJECT IN OUR STORES IN 2010. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2016

, 145 OF OUR STORES USED RECLAMATION TANKS TO COLLECT RAINWATER AND CONDENSATION FROM HVAC UNITS AND GARDEN CENTER ROOFS, WHICH IS IN TURN USED TO WATER PLANTS IN OUR OUTSIDE GARDEN CENTERS. WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL WATER SAVINGS FROM THESE UNITS TO BE OVER 500,000 GALLONS PER STORE FOR TOTAL WATER SAVINGS OF OVER 72.5 MILLION GALLONS IN FISCAL

2016

. OUR 2016 RESPONSIBILITY REPORT, WHICH USES THE GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING, PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ON SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS IN OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS. OUR 2016 RESPONSIBILITY REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT HTTPS://CORPORATE.HOMEDEPOT.COM/RESPONSIBILITY.

OUR COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY HAS RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS. IN 2016, WE RECEIVED THREE SIGNIFICANT AWARDS FROM THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ("EPA"). THE ENERGY STAR

®

DIVISION NAMED US "RETAIL PARTNER OF THE YEAR – SUSTAINED EXCELLENCE" FOR OUR OVERALL EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND WE RECEIVED THE 2016 WATERSENSE

®

SUSTAINED EXCELLENCE AWARD FOR OUR OVERALL EXCELLENCE IN WATER EFFICIENCY. WE ALSO RECEIVED THE EPA’S "SMARTWAY EXCELLENCE AWARD", WHICH RECOGNIZES THE HOME DEPOT AS AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN FREIGHT SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE CDP (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT) REPORTING PROCESS. CDP IS AN INDEPENDENT, INTERNATIONAL, NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION PROVIDING A GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR COMPANIES AND CITIES TO MEASURE, DISCLOSE, MANAGE AND SHARE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION. IN 2016, WE RECEIVED A SCORE OF A- (OUT OF A RANGE FROM A TO E) FROM THE CDP, REFLECTING A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, ADAPTATION AND TRANSPARENCY. WE ALSO WERE NAMED AN INDUSTRY LEADER BY THE CDP.

WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE SHOPPING AND WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY ("EH&S") FUNCTION IS DEDICATED TO ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES, WITH TRAINED ASSOCIATES WHO EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS. OUR EH&S POLICIES ARE WOVEN INTO OUR EVERYDAY OPERATIONS AND ARE PART OF THE HOME DEPOT CULTURE. SOME COMMON PROGRAM ELEMENTS INCLUDE: DAILY STORE INSPECTION CHECKLISTS (BY DEPARTMENT); ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP AUDITS FROM OUR STORE-BASED SAFETY TEAM MEMBERS AND REGIONAL, DISTRICT AND STORE OPERATIONS FIELD TEAMS; EQUIPMENT ENHANCEMENTS AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL SAFETY; DEPARTMENTAL MERCHANDISING SAFETY STANDARDS; TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR ALL ASSOCIATES, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF TRAINING PROVIDED BASED ON AN ASSOCIATE’S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES; AND AWARENESS, COMMUNICATION AND RECOGNITION PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO DRIVE OPERATIONAL AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF EH&S ISSUES.

RETURNING VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, WE DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY THROUGH OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS, WITH A FOCUS ON EXPENSE CONTROL. THIS DISCIPLINE DROVE HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ALLOWED US TO RETURN VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH $7.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES AND

, AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7, "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS".

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, ASSORTMENT AND PRESENTATION OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, PAINT STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES, MRO COMPANIES AND OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH PROVIDERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE FACE GROWING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE AND MULTICHANNEL RETAILERS, SOME OF WHOM MAY HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE THAN OURS, AS OUR CUSTOMERS NOW ROUTINELY USE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMARTPHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES TO SHOP ONLINE AND COMPARE PRICES AND PRODUCTS IN REAL TIME. WE USE OUR MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS TO DRIVE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC AND COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY, AND WE MUST REGULARLY ASSESS AND ADJUST OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS THROUGH AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONAL PRICING OR LIQUIDATION EVENTS, OR OUR INABILITY TO ADAPT EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY TO A CHANGING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, OUR

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARGINS OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF A SUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OR MAINTENANCE OF EFFECTIVE MARKETING, ADVERTISING OR PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS, OUR MARKET SHARE AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, OUR REPUTATION, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS; CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS; AND UNEXPECTED WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHILE ALSO MANAGING APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND MAINTAINING AN EXCELLENT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASING STRENGTH IN THE HOUSING AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET, RESULTING CHANGES IN DEMAND WILL PUT FURTHER PRESSURE ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS AND MAINTAIN HIGH SERVICE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, EACH OF OUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS – DIY, DIFM AND PRO – HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, MANY OF WHICH EVOLVE AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN A PARTICULAR CUSTOMER GROUP CHANGE. WE ALSO NEED TO OFFER MORE LOCALIZED ASSORTMENTS OF OUR MERCHANDISE TO APPEAL TO LOCAL CULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC TASTES WITHIN EACH CUSTOMER GROUP. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY DIFFERENTIATE THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF – OR WITHIN – A CUSTOMER GROUP, WE MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE CUSTOMERS.

CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE METHODS BY WHICH THEY PURCHASE AND RECEIVE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE DEMANDING. CUSTOMERS NOW ROUTINELY USE TECHNOLOGY AND MOBILE DEVICES TO RAPIDLY COMPARE PRODUCTS AND PRICES, DETERMINE REAL-TIME PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND PURCHASE PRODUCTS. ONCE PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED, CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING ALTERNATE OPTIONS FOR DELIVERY OF THOSE PRODUCTS, AND THEY OFTEN EXPECT QUICK AND LOW-COST DELIVERY. WE MUST CONTINUALLY ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PURCHASING PROCESS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS LIKE BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS AND DIRECT FULFILLMENT, BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE PROGRAMS OR OTHERS WE MAY IMPLEMENT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY OR WILL MEET CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. CUSTOMERS ARE ALSO USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT CAN BE QUICKLY AND BROADLY DISSEMINATED. TO THE EXTENT A CUSTOMER HAS A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE AND SHARES IT OVER SOCIAL MEDIA, IT MAY IMPACT OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION.

FURTHER, WE HAVE AN AGING STORE BASE THAT REQUIRES MAINTENANCE AND SPACE REALLOCATION INITIATIVES TO DELIVER THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS DESIRE. WE MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A SAFE STORE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR STORES AND UTILIZE OUR STORE SPACE EFFECTIVELY; TO PROVIDE A COMPELLING ONLINE PRESENCE; TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS; TO PROVIDE QUICK AND LOW-COST DELIVERY ALTERNATIVES; TO DIFFERENTIATE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FOR OUR THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS; AND TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT AN INCREASINGLY LOCALIZED MERCHANDISING ASSORTMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, OUR REPUTATION, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING LABOR RELATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE, OR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. AN INABILITY TO PROVIDE WAGES AND/OR BENEFITS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF JOB SATISFACTION. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS, PARTICULARLY AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AND THE LABOR MARKET TIGHTENS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED OR PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS, STORE, MANAGE AND PROTECT TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS, WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF, SECURITY OF AND CONSISTENT ACCESS TO THIS DATA FOR INFORMATION SUCH AS SALES, MERCHANDISE ORDERING, INVENTORY REPLENISHMENT AND ORDER FULFILLMENT. FOR THESE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST PERIODICALLY MAINTAIN AND UPDATE THEM. OUR SYSTEMS AND THE THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS ON WHICH WE RELY ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM A NUMBER OF CAUSES, INCLUDING POWER OUTAGES; COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES; COMPUTER VIRUSES; SECURITY BREACHES; CYBER-ATTACKS, INCLUDING THE USE OF RANSOMWARE;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES, TORNADOES, OR HURRICANES; ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND DESIGN OR USAGE ERRORS BY OUR ASSOCIATES, CONTRACTORS OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. ALTHOUGH WE AND OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY AND TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE RISK OF COMPROMISE OF THE INTEGRITY, SECURITY AND CONSISTENT OPERATIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS, SUCH EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. AS A RESULT, WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE COSTLY, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL STRATEGY AND GIVE RISE TO NEGATIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES.

THROUGH OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL SHOPPING AND INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE THAT EMPOWERS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AND INTERACT WITH US FROM COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMARTPHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES. WE USE OUR WEBSITES AND OUR MOBILE APP BOTH AS SALES CHANNELS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND ALSO AS METHODS OF PROVIDING PRODUCT, PROJECT AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE BOTH IN-STORE AND ONLINE SALES. WE HAVE MULTIPLE ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND KNOWLEDGE CENTERS THAT ALLOW US TO INFORM, ASSIST AND INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. MULTICHANNEL RETAILING IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND EXPANDING, AND WE MUST EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUALLY SEEK TO ENHANCE ALL OF OUR ONLINE PROPERTIES TO PROVIDE AN ATTRACTIVE USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, AS EVIDENCED BY OUR RECENT REDESIGN OF OUR HOMEDEPOT.COM WEBSITE. DISRUPTIONS, FAILURES OR OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THESE CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR THE BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE TO OUR ONLINE AND IN-STORE BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

IF OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER AND COMPANY INFORMATION ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, AND COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO FURTHER LITIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

OUR BUSINESS, LIKE THAT OF MOST RETAILERS, INVOLVES THE RECEIPT, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CUSTOMERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION, PREFERENCES AND PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION, AS WELL AS OTHER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, SUCH AS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ASSOCIATES AND OUR SUPPLIERS AND CONFIDENTIAL COMPANY INFORMATION. WE ALSO WORK WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS THAT PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT WE USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECEIPT, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS, ARE VULNERABLE TO AN INCREASING THREAT OF CONTINUALLY EVOLVING DATA PROTECTION AND CYBERSECURITY RISKS. UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THESE SYSTEMS OR OUR INFORMATION THROUGH FRAUD OR OTHER MEANS OF DECEIVING OUR ASSOCIATES, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR VENDORS. HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS WE DEVELOP OR OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OR OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD UNEXPECTEDLY COMPROMISE INFORMATION SECURITY. THE METHODS USED TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, DISABLE OR DEGRADE SERVICE OR SABOTAGE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND EVOLVING AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE OR DETECT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND REGULARLY REVIEW AND UPDATE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF DATA AND TO PREVENT DATA LOSS. HOWEVER, THE EVER-EVOLVING THREATS MEAN WE AND OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS MUST CONTINUALLY EVALUATE AND ADAPT OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES AND OVERALL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES, SYSTEM COMPROMISES OR MISUSES OF DATA. ANY FUTURE SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF OUR DATA SECURITY, WHETHER EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL, OR MISUSE OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER OR COMPANY DATA, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES, LAWSUITS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, AS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA COLLECTION AND USE, AND PRIVACY BECOMES INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT-RELATED RISKS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS, EXPOSE US TO FRAUD OR THEFT, SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

WE ACCEPT PAYMENTS USING A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING CASH, CHECKS, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, PAYPAL, OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARDS, AN INSTALLMENT LOAN PROGRAM, TRADE CREDIT, AND GIFT CARDS, AND WE MAY OFFER NEW PAYMENT OPTIONS OVER TIME. ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PAYMENT OPTIONS SUBJECTS US TO RULES, REGULATIONS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PAYMENT NETWORK RULES AND OPERATING GUIDELINES, DATA SECURITY STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, AND RULES GOVERNING ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME OR BE REINTERPRETED, MAKING COMPLIANCE MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY. FOR CERTAIN PAYMENT METHODS, INCLUDING CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, WE PAY INTERCHANGE AND OTHER FEES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OVER TIME AND RAISE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES, INCLUDING THE PROCESSING OF CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS, AND OTHER FORMS OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT. IF THESE COMPANIES BECOME UNABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO US, OR IF THEIR SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, IT COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS. THE PAYMENT METHODS THAT WE OFFER ALSO SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL FRAUD AND THEFT BY CRIMINALS, WHO ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE SOPHISTICATED, SEEKING TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES THAT MAY EXIST IN THE PAYMENT SYSTEMS. IF WE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE RULES OR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PAYMENT METHODS WE ACCEPT, OR IF PAYMENT-RELATED DATA IS COMPROMISED DUE TO A BREACH OR MISUSE OF DATA, WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR COSTS INCURRED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUING BANKS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES OR SUBJECT TO FINES AND HIGHER TRANSACTION FEES, OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCEPT OR FACILITATE CERTAIN TYPES OF PAYMENTS MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN CERTAIN PAYMENT TYPES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SHIFT TO OTHER PAYMENT TYPES OR POTENTIAL CHANGES TO OUR PAYMENT SYSTEMS THAT MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE HOUSING MARKET, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL CLIMATE AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS, THE ECONOMY OR THE POLITICAL CLIMATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS’ CONFIDENCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAUSING THEM TO DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CAUSING THEM TO DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, OR IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL – INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURE RATES; INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS; FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS; LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS; THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING; THE STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT; WEATHER; NATURAL DISASTERS; ACTS OF TERRORISM AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL – COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER CHALLENGES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND RESPONSIBLE SOURCING, AS WELL AS OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER, IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, MILITARY CONFLICT, ACTS OF TERRORISM, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS’ NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ANY DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLIERS’ LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORKS, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR OR OUR SUPPLIERS’ CONTROL.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THESE INITIATIVES, SUCH AS PROJECT SYNC AND COM, OUR NEW CUSTOMER ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHILE SIMPLIFYING CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A MORE INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYING NEW WEB-BASED TOOLS AND SERVICES, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM AND LEAD TO PRODUCT AVAILABILITY ISSUES. FAILURE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS AND IMPLEMENT THEM IN THE RIGHT MANNER AND AT THE RIGHT PACE COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER, EACH OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION WITHIN OUR LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INVENTORY IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, INCREASED SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY RESULT FROM DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS; NATURAL DISASTERS; TRADE POLICY CHANGES OR RESTRICTIONS; TARIFFS OR IMPORT-RELATED TAXES; THIRD-PARTY STRIKES, LOCK-OUTS, WORK STOPPAGES OR SLOWDOWNS; SHIPPING CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS; SUPPLY OR SHIPPING INTERRUPTIONS OR COSTS; OR OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BOTH BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO ALLOW US TO MARKET PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO NATIONAL BRANDS. OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OTHER RETAILERS, GENERALLY CARRY HIGHER MARGINS THAN NATIONAL BRAND PRODUCTS, AND REPRESENT A GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR SALES AND GROSS MARGIN RESULTS.

OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN INCREASED RISKS.

AS WE EXPAND OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISKS DUE TO OUR GREATER ROLE IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MARKETING AND SALE OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE RISKS INCLUDE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO ADMINISTER AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCREASED POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY AND PRODUCT RECALL EXPOSURE AND INCREASED POTENTIAL REPUTATIONAL RISKS RELATED TO THE RESPONSIBLE SOURCING OF THOSE PRODUCTS. TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE ON OUR PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY, WE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE AND AVOID CLAIMS RELATED TO THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF OUR VENDORS’ PRODUCTS, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR VENDORS. ANY FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS SOME OR ALL OF THESE RISKS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICES BUSINESS, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES AND BE SUBJECT TO FINES, LAWSUITS AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, OR THE LOSS OF OUR GENERAL CONTRACTOR LICENSES.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR DIFM CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROFESSIONAL THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF WORK PERFORMED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. HOWEVER, IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY OR TO PROVIDE PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THESE SERVICES, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS FOR VIOLATIONS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY. IN ADDITION, WE MAY SUFFER DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION OR THE LOSS OF OUR GENERAL CONTRACTOR LICENSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.

IN FISCAL 2015, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF INTERLINE, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS ENHANCED OUR ABILITY TO SERVE OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED OUR SHARE OF THE MRO MARKET. DURING FISCAL 2016, WE CONTINUED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY WITH INTERLINE. OUR GOAL IS TO SERVE ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT PRO CUSTOMER GROUPS THROUGH ONE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO DRIVE GROWTH AND CAPTURE MARKET SHARE IN THE RETAIL, SERVICES AND MRO MARKETS, AND THIS STRATEGY DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUING INTEGRATION OF INTERLINE. AS WITH ANY ACQUISITION, WE NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE INTERLINE’S PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ASSOCIATES AND SYSTEMS INTO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. INTEGRATION CAN BE A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS, AND IF THE INTEGRATION IS NOT FULLY SUCCESSFUL OR IS DELAYED FOR A MATERIAL PERIOD OF TIME, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION. FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF INTERLINE IS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, THE ACQUISITION MAY FAIL TO FURTHER OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AS ANTICIPATED, EXPOSE US TO INCREASED COMPETITION OR CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERLINE BUSINESS AND THE WHOLESALE MARKET.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN, EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED, AND THERE HAS BEEN EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY, MAY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL EVENTS. CHANGES IN, EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS; OTHER WAGE, LABOR OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS; HEALTHCARE; DATA PROTECTION AND CYBERSECURITY; THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTATION; LOGISTICS; INTERNATIONAL TRADE; SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY; TAXES; UNCLAIMED PROPERTY;

ENERGY COSTS; OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO OUR INSTALLATION SERVICES BUSINESS, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS OR IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT RETAIL OPERATIONS IN, AND SOURCE PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS FROM, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME RISKS WE FACE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, POTENTIAL ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES; POTENTIAL TARIFFS AND OTHER IMPORT-RELATED TAXES; GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE; AND CHALLENGES IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS CREATE RISK DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVENTORIES, LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH WE DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 (THE "DATA BREACH"); WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES OR EXPERIENCE FUTURE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION.

THE DATA BREACH INVOLVED THE THEFT OF CERTAIN PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION AND CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESSES THROUGH UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS. SINCE THE DATA BREACH OCCURRED, WE HAVE RECORDED $198 MILLION OF PRETAX EXPENSES, NET OF EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DATA BREACH, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA". WE ARE STILL FACING A CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY TWO PURPORTED SHAREHOLDERS AND AN INVESTIGATION BY A NUMBER OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. THESE MATTERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT HOW WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS, HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION, AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND FINES.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA BREACH, WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY MATTERS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE ADVERSE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY, INVOLVEMENT IN THESE LAWSUITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUIRIES, AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, DIVERT MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS, AND IMPACT THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY.

SEC REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEEDINGS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS IF WE REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS MAY RESULT IN MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR MORE.

IN JANUARY 2017, THE COMPANY BECAME AWARE OF AN INVESTIGATION BY THE EPA’S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION INTO THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE WITH LEAD-SAFE WORK PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN JOBS PERFORMED THROUGH OUR INSTALLATION SERVICES BUSINESS.

THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING MONETARY PENALTIES AND CERTAIN CHANGES TO OUR OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCEEDING, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

INCLUDED A $144 MILLION PRETAX GAIN RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR REMAINING EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC. ("HD SUPPLY"). THIS GAIN CONTRIBUTED $0.07 TO DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL

2015.

IN FISCAL

2016

, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

– CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, AND OUR COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE REMAINS STRONG. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN OUR STORES, ONLINE, ON THE JOB SITE AND IN THEIR HOMES. IN FISCAL 2016, WE ROLLED OUT A REDESIGN OF OUR HOME DEPOT WEBSITE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH BETTER SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND A FASTER CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE, AND WE UPDATED OUR MOBILE APP.

IN FISCAL

2016

, WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OUR INTERCONNECTED CAPABILITIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MEET CUSTOMERS’ DEMANDS FOR INCREASED FULFILLMENT OPTIONS. WE COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR NEW COM PLATFORM IN ALL OF OUR U.S. STORES IN FISCAL

2016

. WE ALSO COMPLETED THE ROLL OUT OF OUR BODFS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF COM AND COMPLEMENTS OUR EXISTING INTERCONNECTED RETAIL PROGRAMS. IN FISCAL

2016

, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR ONLINE U.S. ORDERS WERE PICKED UP IN OUR STORES THROUGH OUR BOPIS AND BOSS OFFERINGS. SALES FROM OUR ONLINE CHANNELS INCREASED

19.3%

FOR FISCAL

2016

COMPARED TO FISCAL

2015

, AND REPRESENTED

5.9%

OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR FISCAL

2016

. ALSO IN FISCAL 2016, WE ENABLED A DYNAMIC ETA FEATURE FOR ONLINE ORDERS, WHICH PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE DELIVERY DATE BASED ON THEIR LOCATION. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE CONVERSION RATES AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BLEND OUR PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL ASSETS IN A SEAMLESS AND FRICTIONLESS WAY TO ENHANCE THE END-TO-END CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

– PRODUCT AUTHORITY IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PRODUCT INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. IN FISCAL 2016, WE CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS TO OUR DO-IT-YOURSELF, DO-IT-FOR-ME AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON OFFERING EVERYDAY VALUES IN OUR STORES AND ONLINE. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE OUR MERCHANDISING ASSORTMENT PLANNING AND PRICING TOOLS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AND TO REFINE OUR ONLINE AND IN-STORE PRODUCT ASSORTMENT IN PARTICULAR STORES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY DRIVEN BY CAPITAL ALLOCATION

– OUR APPROACH TO DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY IS ADVANCED THROUGH CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN OUR STORES AND SUPPLY CHAIN, DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, AND BUILDING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND TOTAL VALUE RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. IN FISCAL 2016, WE CONTINUED TO OPTIMIZE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THROUGH OUR MULTI-YEAR PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT SYNC. WE ROLLED OUT THE FIRST PHASE OF PROJECT SYNC TO ALL OF OUR U.S. STORES, AND WE CONTINUE TO ONBOARD NEW SUPPLIERS. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR AVERAGE LEAD TIME FROM SUPPLIER TO SHELF, REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES AND IMPROVE INVENTORY TURNS. AS WE CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT PROJECT SYNC, WE PLAN TO CREATE AN END-TO-END SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS ALL PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS, TO OUR RDCS AND STORE ASSOCIATES, AND TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF

53 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR

$7.0 BILLION

THROUGH THE OPEN MARKET DURING FISCAL

2016

. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION, AND WE ANNOUNCED A 29% INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.89 PER SHARE.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL

WE BELIEVE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL ("ROIC") IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NET OPERATING PROFIT AFTER TAX ("NOPAT"), A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS, AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.

2016

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$9.8 BILLION

COMPARED TO

$9.4 BILLION

JANUARY 29, 2017

WAS $23.6 BILLION.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND ON THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THESE FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES. REVENUES FROM THESE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $8.0 BILLION

AND $8.0 BILLION

OF OUR REVENUE FOR FISCAL

2016

AND

2015

, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUES

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY

70%

VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE US, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2016

OR

2015.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT

SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

,

OR

SELF-INSURANCE

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY), WORKERS’ COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL AND AUTOMOBILE CLAIMS FOR WHICH WE ARE SELF-INSURED. OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION OR DEDUCTIBLE, AS APPLICABLE, FOR EACH CLAIM INVOLVING GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS’ COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO $25 MILLION, $1 MILLION AND $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY STOP LOSS LIMITS FOR SELF-INSURED EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITIES REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED AND ARE ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES. THE LIABILITIES ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

2016

,

2015

OR

2014

. WE MAINTAIN NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF OUR DATA SECURITY. THIS COVERAGE IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 13 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS’ PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS’ PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET COMPETITION AND INFLATION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE STORES WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS OF OWNED LOCATIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SUBLEASE INCOME AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE FOR LEASED LOCATIONS. A 10% DECREASE IN ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME AND A 10% INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL BUT DO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. EACH YEAR WE MAY ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS, WITH A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT COMPLETED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY

THREE

YEARS. WE COMPLETED A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT IN FISCAL 2016.

IN FISCAL

2016

, WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL FOR OUR U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AND THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE FOR EACH RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNIT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL FOR FISCAL

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE "EXCHANGE ACT"). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

JANUARY 29, 2017

BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

JANUARY 29, 2017

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

JANUARY 29, 2017

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

"),

JANUARY 31, 2016

("FISCAL

2015

") AND

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

("FISCAL

2014

") INCLUDE 52 WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("U.S. GAAP"). ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY’S CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO DIRECTLY EXTEND CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGE THE COMPANY’S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM ("PLCC PROGRAM") AND OWN THE RELATED RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PRIMARY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE COMPANY’S PLCC PROGRAM EXPIRES IN

2028

, WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS’ USE OF THE CARDS AND ANY PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A"). THE SUM OF THESE THREE COMPONENTS IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY AS "THE COST OF CREDIT" OF THE PLCC PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING INTERLINE BRANDS, INC. ("INTERLINE"), EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $216 MILLION

AND $253 MILLION

AS OF

JANUARY 29, 2017

AND

JANUARY 31, 2016

, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY’S VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2016

OR

2015.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA AND MEXICO, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND INTERLINE, RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

30%

OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2016

OR

2015.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF THOSE POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED. RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX POSITIONS ARE MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN

50%

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. CHANGES IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN JUDGMENT OCCURS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES ON THESE EARNINGS WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANY’S BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZES

THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO LIMIT THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF THE COMPANY’S DATA SECURITY. THIS COVERAGE IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 13.

THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS’ PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL

2016

, $868 MILLION

AND $884 MILLION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME. THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL

2016

,

2015

OR

2014.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. EACH YEAR THE COMPANY MAY ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS, WITH A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT COMPLETED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY

THREE

YEARS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT IN FISCAL 2016.

IN FISCAL

2016

, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL FOR ITS U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AND THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE FOR EACH RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNIT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL FOR FISCAL

2016

,

2015

OR

2014.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO

12

YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL

ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE ("ASR") AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE ASR AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY PAYS A SPECIFIED AMOUNT TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND RECEIVES AN INITIAL DELIVERY OF SHARES. THIS INITIAL DELIVERY OF SHARES REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT THE COMPANY MAY RECEIVE UNDER THE AGREEMENT. UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE ASR AGREEMENT, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DELIVERS ADDITIONAL SHARES, WITH THE FINAL NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED DETERMINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK OVER THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, LESS A NEGOTIATED DISCOUNT. THE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS AND ARE INCLUDED IN TREASURY STOCK WHEN THE SHARES ARE RECEIVED, AT WHICH TIME THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES CALCULATION FOR BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE TERMS FOR EACH OF THE ASR AGREEMENTS THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO DURING THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. EACH OF THESE AGREEMENTS FOLLOWED THE STRUCTURE OUTLINED ABOVE (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS).

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

AT

JANUARY 29, 2017

, THE COMPANY HAD FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES BEGINNING IN

2017

TO

2036

. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES RELATED TO FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES AT

JANUARY 29, 2017

AND

JANUARY 31, 2016

WERE

$3 MILLION

AND

$3 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY

$4.2 BILLION

OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY’S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR FISCAL YEARS

. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY ONGOING INCOME TAX AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAX EXAMINATIONS COULD REDUCE THE COMPANY’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY

$175 MILLION

. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS THAN THIS AMOUNT, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE DATA BREACH RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY OR PRELIMINARILY RESOLVED, AS FOLLOWS.

PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS.

THE FOUR MAJOR PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS MADE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR COSTS THAT THEY ASSERT THEY OR THEIR ISSUING BANKS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DATA BREACH. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ALL FOUR NETWORKS IN FISCAL 2015.

CUSTOMER CLASS ACTIONS

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED PROBABLE LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WHILE THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACCRUALS WILL BE MATERIAL.

PENDING MATTERS.

TWO PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS, WHICH WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE COMPLAINT, WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT, AND CERTAIN PRESENT AND FORMER MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2016, THE COURT GRANTED THE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. THE SHAREHOLDERS APPEALED THE DISMISSAL TO THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. IN ADDITION, A GROUP OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IS INVESTIGATING EVENTS RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH, INCLUDING HOW IT OCCURRED, ITS CONSEQUENCES AND THE COMPANY’S RESPONSES. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

WHILE LOSSES FROM THESE PENDING MATTERS ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS, OR RANGE OF COSTS, RELATED TO THESE MATTERS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES KNOWN AND WILL RECORD AN
