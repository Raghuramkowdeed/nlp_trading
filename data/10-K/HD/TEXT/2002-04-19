HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE(SM) IN TEXAS THAT SELLS ONLY FLOORING PRODUCTS. WE ALSO

BEGAN TESTING A NEW STORE FORMAT FOCUSED ON THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER, AND AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE WERE OPERATING TWO HOME DEPOT SUPPLY STORES.

WE OFFER PRODUCTS THROUGH TWO DIRECT MARKETING SUBSIDIARIES. MAINTENANCE

WAREHOUSE(R), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, IS A DIRECT MARKETER OF MAINTENANCE,

REPAIR AND OPERATIONS PRODUCTS SERVING PRIMARILY THE MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING AND

RETAIL BUSINESSES

HOME DEPOT STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY FOR HOME DEPOT STORES IS TO OFFER A

BROAD ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES

USING HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE, SERVICE-ORIENTED PERSONNEL AND AGGRESSIVE

ADVERTISING. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR MARKETING

APPROACH AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. WE REGULARLY CHECK

OUR COMPETITORS' PRICES TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH

MARKET.

CUSTOMERS.  HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.

-        DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y") CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR

OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE IN-STORE

EXPERTISE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER MANY

D-I-Y "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE

VENDORS.

-        DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M") CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND

HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR

INSTALLATION. WE OFFER THESE CUSTOMERS INSTALLATION SERVICES

FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS.

-        PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL

REPAIR REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND TRADESMEN. IN MANY

STORES WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL

SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE SELECTIONS

AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE INCREASE

SALES.

PRODUCTS. A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS APPROXIMATELY 40,000 TO 50,000

PRODUCT ITEMS, INCLUDING VARIATIONS IN COLOR AND SIZE. EACH STORE CARRIES A WIDE

SELECTION OF HIGH-QUALITY AND NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF EACH MAJOR PRODUCT GROUP FOR

EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

WE BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE ARE

NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE VENDOR. MOST OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS PURCHASED

DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, WHICH ELIMINATES "MIDDLEMAN" COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT

COMPETITIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

PRODUCTS WE SELL IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY

PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OVERSEAS MANUFACTURERS, WHICH GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS A

BROADER SELECTION OF PRODUCTS AND BETTER VALUES WHILE ENHANCING OUR GROSS

MARGIN. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY TO IDENTIFY

OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE ITEMS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. THIS ENABLES US TO

IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY, TO IMPORT PRODUCTS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER AT A LOWER PRICE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTY IMPORTERS. WE CURRENTLY SOURCE PRODUCTS FROM MORE

THAN 500 MANUFACTURERS IN APPROXIMATELY 40 COUNTRIES.

TO COMPLEMENT THE ESTABLISHED NATIONAL BRAND NAME PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WE HAVE

FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH VENDOR PARTNERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER BRAND

NAMES THAT ARE ONLY OFFERED THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT. AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR

2001, WE OFFERED PRODUCTS UNDER PROPRIETARY AND OTHER EXCLUSIVE BRANDS,

INCLUDING THOMASVILLE(R) KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETS; RIDGID(R) POWER TOOLS;

BEHR PREMIUM PLUS(R) PAINT; MILL'S PRIDE(R) CABINETS; GE(R) SMARTWATER WATER

HEATERS; AND VIGORO(R) FERTILIZER. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENTS WITH OTHER VENDORS TO OFFER PRODUCTS UNDER PROPRIETARY

BRAND NAMES. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND

THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE UNDER EXISTING PROPRIETARY BRANDS.

AT-HOME SERVICES. HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLED SALES AND HOME

MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH ITS AT-HOME SERVICES(R) BUSINESS. THIS SERVICE

TARGETS THE DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMER WHO WILL SELECT AND PURCHASE MATERIALS FOR A

PROJECT AND PREFERS THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. WE

IMPLEMENT OUR INSTALLED SALES PROGRAMS THROUGH INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS

AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE

INSTALLATION OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES, SUCH AS CARPETING, HARD

FLOORING, CABINETS AND SOLID SURFACE COUNTERTOPS, AS WELL AS THE INSTALLATION BY

STRATEGIC PARTNERS OF SALES INITIATED IN OUR STORES FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS

ROOFING, GENERATORS AND FURNACE AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, IN

NOVEMBER 2001 WE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH A NATIONAL COMPANY TO TEST

THE SALE OF CO-BRANDED RESIDENTIAL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SERVICES, SUCH AS LAWN

CARE, TERMITE AND PEST CONTROL, PLUMBING AND DRAIN CLEANING, CARPET AND

UPHOLSTERY CLEANING AND HOME WARRANTIES. THE PROGRAM IS INITIALLY BEING TESTED

IN APPROXIMATELY 30 STORES IN THREE MARKETS.

STORE-RELATED PROGRAMS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR BUSINESS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES

TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY, THEREBY INCREASING SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE

IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED A NUMBER OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES IN HOME DEPOT STORES

AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT SUPPORTING STORE OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2001, INCLUDING.

-        PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMER INITIATIVE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO

BEING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REPAIR REMODELERS, CARPENTERS,

PLUMBERS, PAINTERS, ELECTRICIANS, BUILDING MAINTENANCE

PROFESSIONALS AND DESIGNERS. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE CONTINUED

TO EXPAND OUR PRO INITIATIVE, WHICH ADDS SERVICE-RELATED

PROGRAMS TO OUR STORES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES TO

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. STORES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM

HAVE ADDED ASSOCIATES AT A SALES DESK DEDICATED TO PROVIDING

MORE PERSONALIZED SERVICE TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

4

MANAGING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING AND FILLING ORDERS FOR PICK-UP OR

DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE HOURS WHEN PROFESSIONALS

TYPICALLY SHOP, THESE STORES HAVE ASSIGNED SALES ASSOCIATES IN

CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS. TO BETTER SERVE

OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE ALSO INCREASED QUANTITIES

OF EXISTING PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PURCHASED BY PROFESSIONALS IN

BULK QUANTITIES, AND WE OFFER CERTAIN ITEMS IN EACH DEPARTMENT

PACKAGED IN BULK TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SAVINGS. WHILE AIMED AT

THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER, THIS PROGRAM ALSO ENABLES US TO

BETTER SERVE OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMER WITH IMPROVED CUSTOMER

SERVICE, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, EXPANDED

CREDIT PROGRAMS AND ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE. THROUGH THIS

INITIATIVE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES IN SERVING OUR

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN MANY OF

OUR STORES WITHOUT MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS. BY THE END OF

FISCAL 2001, WE HAD EXPANDED THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER

INITIATIVE INTO APPROXIMATELY 535 STORES, 370 OF WHICH WERE

ADDED DURING THE YEAR. WE ANTICIPATE THAT DURING FISCAL 2002,

WE WILL EXPAND THIS INITIATIVE TO MORE THAN 400 ADDITIONAL

STORES.

-        SPI PROGRAM. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE COMPLETED THE ROLL-OUT OF

OUR SERVICE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT, OR "SPI," PROGRAM. THE

PROGRAM FOCUSES ON MAKING IT EASIER TO SHOP IN OUR STORES

WHILE IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE. THROUGH THE PROGRAM, SOME

ASSOCIATES ARE ASSIGNED SPECIFIC TASKS, ALLOWING OTHERS TO

FOCUS ON ASSISTING CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE SCHEDULE

ASSOCIATES TO RECEIVE SHIPMENTS AND STOCK MERCHANDISE WHEN OUR

STORES ARE CLOSED OR DURING HOURS WHEN THEY HAVE FEWER

CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE THIS SEPARATION OF ASSIGNMENTS ALLOWS US

TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE WHILE IMPROVING LABOR

PRODUCTIVITY, INCREASING TRANSPORTATION AND RECEIVING

EFFICIENCIES, MANAGING INVENTORY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND

INCREASING SALES.

-        CENTRALIZATION OF MERCHANDISING. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE

CENTRALIZED OUR MERCHANDISE BUYING DECISIONS AND VENDOR

SELECTION PROCESSES WHILE RETAINING MERCHANDISING GROUPS IN

OUR DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF

"NEIGHBORHOOD STORE" PRODUCT ASSORTMENTS. THIS STRUCTURE

ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE COMPANY,

WHILE FOCUSING ON THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL NEIGHBORHOODS, AND

TO DEVELOP PRODUCT MIXES TO SATISFY NEIGHBORHOOD BUYING

PREFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH CENTRALIZED BUYING, WE

BELIEVE WE CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR PRODUCT ASSORTMENTS

AND OUR PRICING STRATEGY.

-        APPLIANCE SALES. DURING FISCAL 2000, WE COMPLETED THE ROLL-OUT

OF OUR APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO MOST OF OUR STORES IN THE

U.S. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE SELL APPLIANCES MANUFACTURED BY

GENERAL ELECTRIC(R), MAYTAG(R) AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS. WE

DISPLAY AND STOCK THE MORE POPULAR APPLIANCES IN OUR STORES

AND OFFER THE ABILITY TO SPECIAL ORDER OVER 2,000 ADDITIONAL

PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPUTER KIOSKS LOCATED IN THE STORES.

THROUGH THE COMPUTER KIOSKS WE CAN CHECK INVENTORY AND ARRANGE

FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS

SOON AS 48 HOURS AFTER THE ORDER IS PLACED. DURING FISCAL

2002, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO TEST AN ENHANCED OFFERING OF

APPLIANCES THROUGH 1,500 TO 2,000 FEET OF DEDICATED APPLIANCE

SELLING SPACE IN SELECTED STORES. ABOUT 50 OF OUR STORES HAD

APPLIANCE SHOWROOMS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, AND WE

ANTICIPATE ADDING THEM TO UP TO 350 STORES DURING FISCAL 2002.

5

-        TOOL RENTAL. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO SATISFY A BROAD RANGE

OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER

A TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN CERTAIN STORES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM,

WE RENT APPROXIMATELY 200 COMMERCIAL-QUALITY TOOLS IN TEN

CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SAWS, FLOOR SANDERS, GENERATORS, GAS

POWERED LAWN EQUIPMENT AND PLUMBING TOOLS. CUSTOMERS CAN RENT

THE TOOLS ON AN HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS. OUR

ASSOCIATES WHO WORK IN THE TOOL RENTAL AREA RECEIVE SPECIAL

TRAINING CONCERNING THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TOOLS. AS

OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, WE OFFERED TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN

APPROXIMATELY 466 STORES COMPARED TO 342 STORES AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2000. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE ANTICIPATE HAVING

TOOL RENTAL SERVICES IN APPROXIMATELY 600 STORES. WE BELIEVE

THAT OFFERING THIS SERVICE INCREASES THE SALES OF RELATED

MERCHANDISE WITHOUT REDUCING THE SALES OF EQUIPMENT SIMILAR TO

THAT AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL.

-        CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE BEGAN TESTING

THE USE OF A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TO ANSWER CALLS TO

STORES. IN ADDITION TO HANDLING STORE CALLS, THE CONTACT

CENTER REPRESENTATIVES ASSIST WITH EXPEDITING SPECIAL ORDERS

AND MANAGING INSTALLATION PROJECTS. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT

CENTER ALSO SUPPORTS THE SALE AND INSTALLATION OF WATER

HEATERS AND HVAC EQUIPMENT NATIONWIDE. CALLS COME INTO THE

CENTER WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ASSIST CUSTOMERS

WITH PRODUCT SELECTION AND SCHEDULING INSTALLATIONS. THE

ORDERS ARE THEN FULFILLED THROUGH OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT

THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE BETTER

CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOTH IN OUR STORES AND ON THE PHONE, WHILE

REDUCING COSTS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING THIS TEST DURING

FISCAL 2002.

-        CUSTOMER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE OFFER SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO

ENHANCE THE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS. OUR

ASSOCIATES AND VENDORS TEACH "HOW-TO" CLINICS THAT FOCUS ON

D-I-Y PROJECTS, SUCH AS INSTALLING GARBAGE DISPOSALS, LAYING

PATIO PAVERS OR BUILDING A DECK. IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICS,

WE OFFER HOME DEPOT UNIVERSITY(SM), WHICH PRESENTS FOUR-WEEK

MODULES ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEVERAL FACETS

OF A HOME IMPROVEMENT TOPIC. FOR EXAMPLE, A ROOM ENHANCEMENT

MODULE MAY PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON PAINT, WALLPAPER AND WINDOW

TREATMENTS. THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT'S KIDS WORKSHOP(SM)

PROGRAM, CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN TOOL SAFETY AND COMPLETE A

SMALL BUILDING PROJECT, SUCH AS A BIRDHOUSE OR TOOL BOX. WE

BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCREASE OUR

SALES BY ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE MORE PROJECTS,

DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OUR COMPETITION AND REINFORCING OUR

POSITION AS EXPERTS IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

STORE GROWTH

UNITED STATES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE WERE OPERATING 1,201 HOME DEPOT

STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE

OPENED 172 NEW HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THESE NEW STORE OPENINGS

OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN EXISTING MARKETS, WE CONTINUED OUR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION BY

OPENING STORES IN A NUMBER OF NEW MARKETS.

TO INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND ENHANCE

LONG-TERM MARKET PENETRATION, WE OFTEN OPEN NEW STORES NEAR THE EDGE OF THE

MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES.

6

WHILE THESE OPENINGS MAY INITIALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMPARABLE

STORE-FOR-STORE SALES, WE BELIEVE THIS "CANNIBALIZATION" STRATEGY INCREASES

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND OVERALL MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING DELAYS IN SHOPPING,

INCREASING UTILIZATION BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS TO

MORE CONVENIENT LOCATIONS. DURING FISCAL 2001, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR STORES

WERE CANNIBALIZED BY NEW STORE OPENINGS.

CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE WERE OPERATING 78 HOME DEPOT STORES IN

SEVEN CANADIAN PROVINCES. OF THESE STORES, 11 WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2001.

OUR CANADIAN STORES ARE OPERATED THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY OF

THE HOME DEPOT.

MEXICO. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE ACQUIRED TOTALHOME, MEXICO'S SECOND LARGEST HOME

IMPROVEMENT RETAILER, WHICH HAS THREE STORES IN MONTERREY AND ONE IN MEXICO

CITY. IN MARCH 2002, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO

PURCHASE DEL NORTE, A FOUR-STORE CHAIN OF HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES IN JUAREZ,

MEXICO. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. WE

PLAN TO BUILD TWO ADDITIONAL STORES IN MEXICALI AND TIJUANA DURING FISCAL 2002

AND ARE PURSUING SEVERAL ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS.

DURING FISCAL 2002, WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO OPEN 200 STORES, INCLUDING HOME DEPOT

STORES, EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AND OTHER FORMATS.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY FOR OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IS

TO BE A COMPLETE HOME DECORATING AND REMODELING RESOURCE. EACH OF THESE STORES

OFFERS 10 SPECIALTY BUSINESSES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FEATURES DESIGN SHOWROOMS WITH

FULL-SIZE DISPLAYS TO HELP CUSTOMERS VISUALIZE THE END RESULT OF POSSIBLE

INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECTS. TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO OFFER COMPLETE

PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, WE EMPLOY ASSOCIATES

WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING, PLANNING AND COMPLETING DECORATING AND

REMODELING PROJECTS.

CUSTOMERS. TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE MIDDLE TO UPPER

INCOME D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS, WHO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE FOR INSTALLATION BY OTHERS.

ACCORDINGLY, WE OFFER INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AT

THESE STORES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR TRADE CUSTOMERS ARE CUSTOM BUILDERS, REMODELERS,

DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS.

PRODUCTS. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS AND

INSTALLATION SERVICES IN THE FOLLOWING CORE PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

-        KITCHENS

-        BATHS

-        LIGHTING

-        TILE, STONE AND WOOD

-        APPLIANCES

-        SEASONAL

-        DECORATIVE FABRICS AND WINDOW TREATMENTS

7

-        CARPETS AND RUGS

-        ACCESSORIES

-        HOME STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF MERCHANDISE IN AN EFFORT TO

MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF SHOPPERS WHOSE INTERIOR DESIGN PREFERENCES MAY GO BEYOND

THE ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A HOME DEPOT STORE. WHILE THERE IS MINIMAL OVERLAP

BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES,

THOSE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES REPRESENT A BROADER AND

MORE UNIQUE ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN ADDITION TO NATIONALLY ADVERTISED

BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO OFFER ITEMS THAT MUST BE SPECIAL ORDERED OR THAT

ARE TYPICALLY OFFERED THROUGH SHOWROOMS OPEN ONLY TO DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.

STORE GROWTH. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE WERE OPERATING 41 EXPO DESIGN CENTER

STORES, 15 OF WHICH WERE OPENED THAT YEAR. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE GROWING THE

NUMBER OF EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES BY APPROXIMATELY 25% IN FISCAL 2002. WE WILL

FOCUS ON EXPANDING IN THE TOP 100 U.S. METROPOLITAN MARKETS. THESE NEW STORES

ARE EXPECTED TO AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 101,000 SQUARE FEET AND WILL INCORPORATE A

SHOWROOM ENVIRONMENT.

IN-STORE SERVICES. WE HAVE ASSOCIATES AT OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES TO ASSIST

WITH EVERY PHASE OF A PROJECT. CERTIFIED KITCHEN AND BATH DESIGNERS ARE ON

STAFF, AS WELL AS DESIGN PROFESSIONALS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS DESIGN LIGHTING,

TILE AND FLOORING, CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY AND BEDDING, CUSTOM CLOSETS AND WINDOW

TREATMENTS. INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR MOST PRODUCTS AT EXPO DESIGN

CENTER STORES, INCLUDING KITCHENS, BATHS, FLOORING, WALLPAPER, TILE, LIGHTING

FIXTURES AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. OUR PROJECT MANAGERS ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS

ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN SCHEDULE LICENSED THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS TO COMPLETE THE

WORK. WE ALSO OFFER SPECIAL TRADE SERVICES, SUCH AS DEDICATED OUTSIDE SALES

PEOPLE AND DESIGNERS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

GEORGIA LIGHTING

WE ACQUIRED OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY GEORGIA LIGHTING IN JUNE 1999. GEORGIA

LIGHTING IS A SPECIALTY LIGHTING DESIGNER, DISTRIBUTOR AND RETAILER BASED IN

ATLANTA. THE COMPANY, WHICH HAS SEVEN RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFERS AN EXTENSIVE

COLLECTION OF DECORATIVE LIGHTING FIXTURES, SUPPLIES, ACCENTS AND ACCESSORIES TO

COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACQUISITION OF GEORGIA

LIGHTING HAS ALLOWED US TO STRENGTHEN OUR SOURCING, TRAINING AND MERCHANDISING

IN LIGHTING FOR BOTH THE HOME DEPOT AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES.

THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE

DURING FISCAL 2000, WE OPENED A TEST STORE IN PLANO, TEXAS THAT OFFERS FLOORING

PRODUCTS. THE FLOOR STORE'S MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT INCLUDES CARPET, CERAMIC,

WOOD, LAMINATE AND VINYL FLOORING. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING

TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST.

HOME DEPOT URBAN STORES

WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO OPEN OUR FIRST THREE URBAN STORES IN FISCAL 2002. ONE WILL

BE IN BROOKLYN WITH APPROXIMATELY 61,000 SQUARE FEET; ONE WILL BE IN STATEN

ISLAND WITH APPROXIMATELY 79,000

8

SQUARE FEET AND THE OTHER WILL BE A TWO-LEVEL STORE WITH APPROXIMATELY 80,000

WHICH WILL BE SELECTED DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH THE

STORE IS LOCATED. WE ARE CONTINUING TO ANALYZE OTHER URBAN AND HIGH DENSITY

SUBURBAN MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR ADDITIONAL SITES TO TEST THIS

SMALLER STORE CONCEPT. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL BE RE-BRANDING OUR FOUR VILLAGER'S

HARDWARE STORES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN NEW JERSEY, AS HOME DEPOT URBAN STORES.

OTHER BUSINESSES

APEX SUPPLY COMPANY

IN JANUARY 2000, WE ACQUIRED APEX SUPPLY COMPANY, A WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR OF

PLUMBING, HVAC, APPLIANCES AND OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY OFFERS THESE

PRODUCTS THROUGH 22 LOCATIONS IN FLORIDA, GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND TENNESSEE

AND EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 580 ASSOCIATES. APEX ASSISTED US WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

OF OUR HVAC PROGRAM, AND WE BELIEVE THIS ACQUISITION WILL HELP US TO INCREASE

OUR PENETRATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL PLUMBING TRADES.

YOUR "OTHER" WAREHOUSE

WE ACQUIRED YOUR "OTHER" WAREHOUSE IN NOVEMBER 2001. THIS SUBSIDIARY IS A

PLUMBING DISTRIBUTOR THAT FOCUSES ON DECORATIVE AND COMMERCIAL PLUMBING

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SPECIAL ORDERS. YOUR "OTHER" WAREHOUSE CARRIES OVER 36,000

PRODUCTS FROM OVER 100 PLUMBING VENDORS, INCLUDING KOHLER(R), AMERICAN

STANDARD(R) AND OTHER MAJOR MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY OPERATES THREE PRIMARY

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND A CALL CENTER. WE BELIEVE THIS ACQUISITION WILL

ASSIST US BY IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND SIMPLIFYING THE SPECIAL

ORDER PROCESS IN OUR STORES.

HOME DEPOT SUPPLY

WE ARE TESTING A NEW STORE FORMAT FOCUSED ON THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER. THESE

HOME DEPOT SUPPLY STORES OFFER PERSONAL SERVICE WITH EXPERIENCED ACCOUNT

MANAGERS, EXPANDED ASSORTMENTS, GREATER QUANTITIES OF MERCHANDISE AND EXPANDED

DELIVERY SERVICES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE WERE OPERATING TWO OF THESE

STORES, AND WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE OPENING THREE TO FIVE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY

STORES DURING FISCAL 2002.

MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE

OUR MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE SUBSIDIARY IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF MAINTENANCE,

REPAIR AND OPERATIONS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO THE MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING AND LODGING

FACILITIES MANAGEMENT MARKET. THROUGH ITS CATALOG, WHICH IS PUBLISHED

NATIONAL BLINDS & WALLPAPER

NATIONAL BLINDS AND WALLPAPER SELLS DECOR PRODUCTS THROUGH TELEPHONE SALES AND

OVER THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY MARKETS PRIMARILY THROUGH MAGAZINE ADVERTISING

AIMED AT CUSTOMERS SEEKING THE LOWEST PRICES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NO

INVENTORY, AS ORDERS ARE SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER.

INTERNET

OUR PRIMARY WEBSITE IS LOCATED AT WWW.HOMEDEPOT.COM. THE SITE OFFERS INFORMATION

ABOUT PROJECTS AND OUR PRODUCTS, CALCULATORS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF

MATERIALS NEEDED TO COMPLETE A PROJECT, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY

AND LINKS TO OUR OTHER ON-LINE BUSINESSES. AS WITH OUR STORES, THE FOCUS OF OUR

WEBSITE IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE BELIEVE OUR INTERNET SITE PROVIDES US WITH AN

OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS,

IMPROVE SERVICE, PROVIDE CONVENIENT SHOPPING FROM HOME AND INCREASE STORE SALES.

THROUGH WWW.HOMEDEPOT.COM, WE OFFER APPROXIMATELY 20,000 ITEMS FOR SALE. WE

OFFER CUSTOMERS THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT STORES IN THEIR REGION ON OUR WEBSITE,

AND THE PRODUCTS ARE PRICED BASED ON THE REGION IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER LIVES.

ORDERS ARE FULFILLED FROM CERTAIN STORES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS INTERNET

FULFILLMENT STORES AND ARE SHIPPED THROUGH UNITED PARCEL SERVICE(R). BY

INTEGRATING INTERNET PURCHASES WITH OUR STORES, WE HOPE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS

WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND SERVICE. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE LAUNCHED

WWW.EXPO.COM THROUGH WHICH CUSTOMERS CAN ORDER SELECT PRODUCTS FROM OUR EXPO

DESIGN CENTER STORES AND OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THESE STORES AND THE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES THEY OFFER. WE ALSO BEGAN SELLING HOME DEPOT CLEARANCE MERCHANDISE

THROUGH EBAY(R). WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO TEST SELLING CLEARANCE MERCHANDISE

THROUGH THE INTERNET DURING FISCAL 2002.

WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR WEBSITE ADDRESSES ONLY AS INACTIVE TEXTUAL REFERENCES. THE

INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OUR WEBSITES IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS

FORM 10-K.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. EACH HOME DEPOT, EXPO DESIGN CENTER AND VILLAGER'S HARDWARE

STORE IS EQUIPPED WITH A COMPUTERIZED POINT OF SALE SYSTEM, ELECTRONIC BAR CODE

SCANNING SYSTEM AND A UNIX SERVER. STORE INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED TO THE

STORE SUPPORT CENTER'S COMPUTERS VIA A LAND-BASED ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE

("ATM") NETWORK IN THE U.S. AND A FRAME RELAY NETWORK INTERNATIONALLY. THESE

COMPUTERS PROVIDE CORPORATE, FINANCIAL, MERCHANDISING AND OTHER BACK OFFICE

FUNCTION SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE OUR SYSTEMS PROVIDE EFFICIENT CUSTOMER CHECK-OUT

AND RETURNS, STORE-BASED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, RAPID ORDER REPLENISHMENT, LABOR

PLANNING SUPPORT AND ITEM MOVEMENT INFORMATION. FAST REGISTERS, CREDIT

AUTHORIZATIONS AND CHECK APPROVALS EXPEDITE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR STORES AT A PACE

THAT WE BELIEVE SETS THE STANDARD FOR OUR INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, TO BETTER SERVE

THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS APPLYING FOR CREDIT WHILE IN OUR STORES, THE

CHARGE CARD APPROVAL PROCESS TIME HAS BEEN REDUCED TO LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A MOBILE ORDERING SYSTEM IN OUR HOME DEPOT STORES USING

PORTABLE CARTS WITH COMPUTERS TO ASSIST OUR ASSOCIATES IN PLACING ACCURATE

ORDERS FOR INVENTORY. THROUGH THE SYSTEM, AN

10

ASSOCIATE ON THE SALES FLOOR CAN SEE THE SUPPLY THE STORE HAS FOR A GIVEN ITEM,

REVIEW THE SUGGESTED RE-ORDER QUANTITIES BASED ON THE STORE'S HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND PLACE AN ORDER WITH THE VENDOR. WE BELIEVE THE SYSTEM INCREASES

THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR ASSOCIATES BECAUSE IT REQUIRES LESS TIME

AND FEWER PEOPLE TO ASSESS AND ORDER INVENTORY. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A

MOBILE SIGNING SYSTEM TO HELP ENSURE THAT OUR SIGNING IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR

POINT-OF-SALE PRICE DATA. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLING OUT

ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS TOOLS TO ASSIST WITH LABOR SCHEDULING TO HELP ENSURE THE BEST

POSSIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS.

WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING AND UPGRADING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT

GROWTH, REDUCE AND CONTROL COSTS AND ENABLE OUR ASSOCIATES TO MAKE BETTER

DECISIONS. WE CONTINUE TO REALIZE GREATER EFFICIENCY AS A RESULT OF OUR

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE ("EDI") PROGRAM. CURRENTLY, MOST OF OUR HIGH VOLUME

VENDORS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE EDI PROGRAM, WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN 70% OF

OUR TOTAL TRANSACTIONAL VOLUME. EDI IS A PAPERLESS SYSTEM, WHICH PROCESSES

ORDERS FROM BUYING OFFICES TO VENDORS, ALERTS THE STORES WHEN THE MERCHANDISE IS

TO ARRIVE AND TRANSMITS INVOICE DATA FROM THE VENDORS AND FREIGHT CARRIERS TO

THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A WEB-BASED

INVOICING SYSTEM THAT, AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, WAS BEING USED BY OVER

900 SUPPLIERS.

WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS DURING FISCAL 2001. IN THE

TRANSPORTATION AREA, WE INTRODUCED THE USE OF BID OPTIMIZATION TOOLS TO

LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS THAT ALLOW THE CARRIERS TO ANALYZE EFFICIENT ROUTE

COMBINATIONS AND THEREBY REDUCE OUR COSTS. IN ADDITION, WE IMPLEMENTED A

TRUCKLOAD TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND CUSTOM SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT OUR

TRANSIT FACILITIES. TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING IMPORT VOLUME, WE ALSO DEVELOPED AND

IMPLEMENTED AN ADVANCED FORECASTING SYSTEM AND ROLLED OUT TO OUR IMPORT

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS COMMON DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR INCREASED

SPEED, FLEXIBILITY AND CONSISTENCY. IN FISCAL 2002, WE PLAN TO ROLL THESE

SYSTEMS OUT TO OUR LUMBER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.

DURING FISCAL 2003, WE PLAN TO RELEASE A NEW SYSTEM TO SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS

SPECIAL ORDERS AND INSTALLATIONS. THE SYSTEM WILL INTEGRATE THE ORDERING,

DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION OF PRODUCTS TO ALLOW US TO MANAGE PROJECTS MORE

EFFICIENTLY. WE BELIEVE THIS SYSTEM WILL INCREASE ACCURACY AND SPEED WHILE

REDUCING COSTS.

ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 256,000

ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 14,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER

COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 65% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED

ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO

MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET AREA. STORE MANAGERS

HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION REGARDING COMPETITIVE SALARY RATES IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

WE DEVELOP OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF

OUR ASSOCIATES. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF

MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MANDATORY PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE

TRAINING CLASSES, AND TO EDUCATE, DEVELOP AND TEST THE SKILLS OF THOSE

ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BEING PROMOTED. BECAUSE WE PROMOTE OR RELOCATE

CURRENT ASSOCIATES TO SERVE AS MANAGERS AND ASSISTANT MANAGERS FOR NEW STORES,

TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATES IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR GROWTH. OUR

DISTRICT MANAGERS AND STORE MANAGERS TYPICALLY MEET WITH OUR HUMAN RESOURCES

ASSOCIATES TO DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND CERTAIN

DEPARTMENT HEADS AND CONSIDER POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION.

11

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS IN OUR STORES AND DIVISIONAL OFFICES TO ENSURE WE

HIRE AND PROMOTE THE MOST QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAY. ONE

OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS WE HAVE IS OUR ANNUAL HR REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH

ASSESSES LEADERS AND TEAMS, REVIEWS SUCCESSION PLANNING AND EXECUTIVE PIPELINE,

HIGH POTENTIAL ASSOCIATES, STAFFING, RETENTION, DIVERSITY, TRAINING AND

COMPLIANCE. THE PROGRAM IS CLOSELY LINKED TO OUR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS,

WHICH EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE, LEADERSHIP AND POTENTIAL OF ALL ASSOCIATES. WE

ALSO MAINTAIN A LIST OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN NEW

ASSIGNMENTS AND OF QUALIFIED OUTSIDE APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE REVIEWED WHEN

POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE GOOD.

MARKETING. WE ARE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAIL ADVERTISERS, AND WE UTILIZE

ALL FORMS OF MASS MEDIA AND SELECTED FORMS OF HIGHLY TARGETED MEDIA. WE ALSO

INCORPORATE MAJOR SPONSORSHIPS INTO OUR MARKETING PLAN, SUCH AS NASCAR(R), THE

OLYMPIC(R) GAMES, CBS(R) COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND HOME AND GARDEN SHOWS. WE EXTEND

OUR REACH AND EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROPRIETARY PUBLICATIONS, SUCH AS

THE 1-2-3(SM) HOME IMPROVEMENT SERIES AND THE STYLE IDEAS(SM) MAGAZINE.

WE EXECUTE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON BOTH A NATIONAL AND LOCAL BASIS. BECAUSE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STORES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA, WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN SMALLER RETAILERS BY USING

NATIONAL ADVERTISING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE TAILOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR

ADVERTISING LOCALLY TO RESPOND TO MARKET DIFFERENCES, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTS

AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

CREDIT SERVICES. HOME DEPOT OFFERS CREDIT PURCHASE PROGRAMS TO BOTH PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS AND D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2001, 2.9 MILLION NEW HOME

DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOME DEPOT

ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO ALMOST 10 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 21% OF ALL HOME DEPOT SALES IN FISCAL 2001. WE ALSO OFFER AN

UNSECURED HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN THAT GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LOAN PROGRAM

NOT ONLY INCREASES LARGE SALES, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATH REMODELS, BUT ALSO

GENERATES INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE

HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION OF A VARIETY OF TRADE NAMES, SERVICE

MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE HOME

DEPOT(R), THE "HOMER" (R) CHARACTER, EXPO DESIGN CENTER(R) STORES, HAMPTON

BAY(R) FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES, GLACIER BAY(R) TOILETS, SINKS AND

FAUCETS, PEGASUS(TM) FAUCETS AND BATH ACCESSORIES, TRAFFIC MASTER(R) CARPET,

COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC(R) LIGHTING FIXTURES, WORKFORCE(R) TOOLS, TOOL BOXES AND

SHELVING AND PREMIUMCUT(R) LUMBER. WE REGARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING

SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF THE

COMPANY AND OUR STORES AND DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY

FACTS THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR OUR GLOBALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT WE DIRECTLY

IMPORT, WE HAVE A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR BOTH VENDOR/FACTORY AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, WHICH

MEASURE FACTORS INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY, TIMELY SHIPMENTS AND FILL RATE. THE

PERFORMANCE RECORD IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE

FOR IMPROVEMENT. THIS QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH IS APPLIED TO PRODUCTS

DIRECTLY IMPORTED BY HOME DEPOT, HAS FOUR COMPONENTS.

12

-        WE AUTHORIZE LABORATORIES TO TEST PRODUCTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS;

-        WE DEVELOP AND DOCUMENT PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS, BASED ON TEST

RESULTS, APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND

FEATURES DETERMINED BY OUR MERCHANTS;

-        WE ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF FACTORIES TO MANUFACTURE QUALITY

PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AS WELL

AS TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HOME DEPOT POLICIES; AND

-        WE ROUTINELY ASSESS PRODUCT QUALITY AND FACTORY PERFORMANCE BY

CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY ON SHIPMENTS TO ASSURE

CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS.

LOGISTICS. WE USE SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASE

OUR EFFICIENCIES. OVER 80% OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM OUR

VENDORS TO THE STORES. WE OPERATE A NUMBER OF FACILITIES TO DISTRIBUTE THE

REMAINING MERCHANDISE TO OUR STORES. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN IMPORT PRODUCTS

REQUIRE THE USE OF DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. ACCORDINGLY, AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, WE

HAD SEVEN IMPORT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.

ADDITIONALLY, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, WE HAD 29 LUMBER DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO SUPPORT THE LUMBER DEMANDS OF OUR

STORES. WE ALSO OPERATED THREE TRANSIT FACILITIES AT THE END OF 2001. AT THESE

FACILITIES, WE RECEIVE MERCHANDISE FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IMMEDIATELY CROSS DOCK

IT ONTO TRUCKS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES. AS OUR STORE DENSITY INCREASES, WE

PLAN TO CONTINUE ADDING TRANSIT FACILITIES UP TO A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF 15-20

FACILITIES. THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES ALLOW US TO PROVIDE

HIGH SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR STORES AT RELATIVELY LOW COSTS. OUR CURRENT PLANS

CALL FOR SEVEN ADDITIONAL TRANSIT FACILITIES IN FISCAL 2002.

IN ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE SUPPLIES AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE

DELIVERY SERVICES DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES

TO IMPROVE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO BETTER SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR STORES

AND OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO LOWER COSTS.

SAFETY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND

ASSOCIATES. OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT CONSISTS OF A TEAM OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS

IN THE FIELD FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS AN

ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT

POLICIES AND PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE. THE GOAL OF THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS TO

IMPLEMENT A SAFETY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO INCORPORATE SAFETY INTO THE FABRIC OF OUR

COMPANY, ESTABLISHING A "SAFETY FIRST" APPROACH TO ALL FACETS OF OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE COMPANY'S SAFETY PROGRAM,

WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STORE-LEVEL ASSOCIATES, STORE AND

DIVISION MANAGEMENT, AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS. THE

PRIMARY FOCUSES OF OUR SAFETY PROGRAM ARE (1) TO ESTABLISH SAFETY STANDARDS AND

PROCESSES FOR ALL ASPECTS OF STORE OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, (2) TO

EFFECTIVELY TRAIN APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATES ON ALL APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND (3) TO

MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED SAFETY STANDARDS.

COMPETITION. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE

LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE

SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING

AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER

13

YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES,

LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS,

INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS. IN

ADDITION TO THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ALSO COMPETE WITH

SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR

DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. DUE TO THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE

TO PRECISELY MEASURE OUR MARKET SHARE IN EXISTING MARKET AREAS. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITOR IN OUR MARKETS.

ADDITIONALLY, AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, WE WERE OPERATING FOUR VILLAGER'S HARDWARE

TEST STORES, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN NEW JERSEY; SEVEN GEORGIA LIGHTING

RETAIL LOCATIONS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN GEORGIA; 22

APEX SUPPLY LOCATIONS, OF WHICH ONE IS LOCATED IN FLORIDA, 15 ARE LOCATED IN

GEORGIA, FOUR ARE LOCATED IN TENNESSEE AND TWO ARE LOCATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA;

ONE THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE LOCATION IN TEXAS; AND FOUR YOUR "OTHER"

WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS IN LOUISIANA AND NEVADA.

STORES AND THE FLOOR STORE, AT FEBRUARY 3, 2002, APPROXIMATELY 80% WERE OWNED

(INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY

116,901,000 SQUARE FEET AND APPROXIMATELY 20% WERE LEASED CONSISTING OF

APPROXIMATELY 28,541,000 SQUARE FEET. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE

RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE OWNED. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

LEASE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES, WE GENERALLY PREFER TO OWN STORES BECAUSE OF

GREATER OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY, GENERALLY LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. WE BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF EXISTING LEASE

TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE CAN BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE

SPACE FOR LEASE OR PURCHASE THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE.

OUR EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY

1,773,000 SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. IN

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE

DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2002 COMPARED TO JANUARY 28, 2001. FISCAL YEAR

2001 CONSISTED OF 53 WEEKS COMPARED TO 52 WEEKS IN FISCAL 2000. NET SALES FOR

FISCAL 2001 INCREASED 17.1% TO $53.6 BILLION FROM $45.7 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000.

THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE 204 NEW STORES OPENED

DURING FISCAL 2001 AND FULL YEAR SALES FROM THE 204 NEW STORES OPENED DURING

FISCAL 2000. APPROXIMATELY $880 MILLION OF THE INCREASE IN SALES WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN FISCAL 2001. COMPARABLE STORE-FOR-STORE

SALES WERE FLAT IN FISCAL 2001 DUE TO THE WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT RESULTING

FROM CERTAIN FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND

HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT.

19

GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 30.2% FOR FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO 29.9%

FOR FISCAL 2000. THE RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER COST OF

MERCHANDISE RESULTING FROM PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS, PURCHASING SYNERGIES CREATED BY

OUR NEWLY CENTRALIZED MERCHANDISING STRUCTURE AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

TOOL RENTAL CENTERS FROM 342 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000 TO 466 AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2001. WE EXPECT TO HAVE TOOL RENTAL CENTERS IN APPROXIMATELY 600 STORES

BY THE END OF FISCAL 2002.

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 20.9% FOR FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO

20.7% FOR FISCAL 2000. SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

SALES INCREASED TO 19.0% IN FISCAL 2001 FROM 18.6% IN FISCAL 2000. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS RESULTING FROM

HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND PROPERTY TAXES DUE TO OUR INVESTMENT IN NEW STORES,

COMBINED WITH INCREASED ENERGY COSTS. ALSO, CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION FEES WERE

HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASED PENETRATION OF TOTAL CREDIT SALES.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN STORE PAYROLL EXPENSE

CAUSED BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN LABOR PRODUCTIVITY RESULTING FROM INITIATIVES INSIDE

THE STORE AND NEW SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS.

STORE INITIATIVES INCLUDE OUR SERVICE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ("SPI") INITIATIVE

WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN EVERY HOME DEPOT STORE IN FISCAL 2001. UNDER SPI OUR

STORES RECEIVE AND HANDLE INVENTORY AT NIGHT, ALLOWING OUR ASSOCIATES TO SPEND

MORE TIME WITH CUSTOMERS DURING PEAK SELLING HOURS. IN ADDITION, OUR PRO PROGRAM

WAS IN 535 OF OUR HOME DEPOT STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, PROVIDING

DEDICATED STORE RESOURCES TO SERVE THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

WE EXPECT TO HAVE OUR PRO INITIATIVE IN MORE THAN 950 STORES AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2002. SPI AND PRO HAVE RESULTED IN IMPROVED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY,

SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 0.2% FOR FISCAL 2001 AND 0.3%

FOR FISCAL 2000. WE OPENED 204 NEW STORES IN BOTH FISCAL 2001 AND 2000.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AVERAGED $569,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO

$671,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 2000. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE EXPENSE PER STORE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SHORTER PRE-OPENING PERIODS AS WE REENGINEERED OUR STORE

OPENING PROCESS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 1.7% FOR FISCAL

2001 COMPARED TO 1.8% IN FISCAL 2000. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO COST

SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REORGANIZATION OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF OUR GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE, SUCH AS THE CENTRALIZATION OF OUR MERCHANDISING

ORGANIZATION, AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPENSE CONTROL IN AREAS SUCH AS TRAVEL.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH FISCAL

2001 AND 2000. INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH FISCAL

2001 AND 2000.

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED TO 38.6% FOR

FISCAL 2001 FROM 38.8% FOR FISCAL 2000. THE DECREASE IN FISCAL 2001 WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER TAX CREDITS AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE STATE INCOME TAX RATE

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000.

NET EARNINGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 5.7% FOR FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO 5.6%

FOR FISCAL 2000, REFLECTING THE INCREASED GROSS PROFIT RATE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER STORE OPERATING EXPENSES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE WERE $1.29 FOR FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO $1.10 FOR FISCAL 2000.

20

FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2001 COMPARED TO JANUARY 30, 2000. NET SALES FOR

FISCAL 2000 INCREASED 19.0% TO $45.7 BILLION FROM $38.4 BILLION IN FISCAL 1999.

THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FULL YEAR SALES FROM THE

169 NEW STORES OPENED DURING FISCAL 1999, A 4% COMPARABLE STORE-FOR-STORE SALES

INCREASE AND 204 NEW STORE OPENINGS.

GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 29.9% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO 29.7%

FOR FISCAL 1999. THE RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER COST OF

MERCHANDISE RESULTING FROM PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS, BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL SOURCING

PROGRAMS AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TOOL RENTAL CENTERS FROM 150 AT THE

END OF FISCAL 1999 TO 342 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000.

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 20.7% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO

19.8% FOR FISCAL 1999. SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

SALES INCREASED TO 18.6% IN FISCAL 2000 FROM 17.8% IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER STORE SELLING PAYROLL EXPENSES RESULTING

FROM MARKET WAGE PRESSURES AND AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE LONGEVITY. IN ADDITION,

MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER FAMILY ENROLLMENT IN OUR MEDICAL PLANS,

RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND HIGHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. FINALLY, STORE

OCCUPANCY COSTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY TAXES, PROPERTY RENT, DEPRECIATION AND

UTILITIES, INCREASED DUE TO NEW STORE GROWTH AND ENERGY RATE INCREASES.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 0.3% FOR BOTH FISCAL 2000 AND

1999. WE OPENED 204 NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2000, COMPARED TO OPENING 169 NEW

STORES IN FISCAL 1999. PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AVERAGED $671,000 PER STORE IN

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO $643,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 1999. THE HIGHER AVERAGE

EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE OPENING OF MORE EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AND

EXPANSION OF HOME DEPOT STORES INTO CERTAIN NEW MARKETS INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL

LOCATIONS, WHICH INVOLVED LONGER PRE-OPENING PERIODS AND HIGHER TRAINING, TRAVEL

AND RELOCATION COSTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 1.8% FOR FISCAL

2000 COMPARED TO 1.7% FOR FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS A

FULL YEAR OF PAYROLL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING FOUR NEW

DIVISIONAL OFFICES, WHICH OPENED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH FISCAL

2000 AND 1999. INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH

COMPARABLE PERIODS.

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED TO 38.8% FOR

FISCAL 2000 FROM 39.0% FOR FISCAL 1999. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER

TAX CREDITS IN FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999.

NET EARNINGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 5.6% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO 6.0%

FOR FISCAL 1999, REFLECTING HIGHER SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A

PERCENT OF SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER GROSS PROFIT RATE AS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $1.10 FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO $1.00

FOR FISCAL 1999.

21

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2001, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS INCREASED TO $6.0

BILLION FROM $2.8 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING FROM 23 DAYS AT THE END OF FISCAL

2000 TO 34 DAYS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001, A 12.7% DECREASE IN AVERAGE INVENTORY

PER STORE AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2001 AND INCREASED OPERATING INCOME. THE

GROWTH IN DAYS PAYABLE AND DECREASE IN AVERAGE INVENTORY PER STORE ARE THE

RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION BY EXTENDING OUR

PAYMENT TERMS TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND ENHANCING INVENTORY ASSORTMENTS.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

WAS $3.5 BILLION IN BOTH FISCAL 2001 AND 2000. WE OPENED 204 NEW STORES IN BOTH

FISCAL 2001 AND 2000. WE OWN 188 OF THE STORES OPENED IN 2001 AND LEASE THE

REMAINDER.

WE PLAN TO OPEN 200 STORES IN FISCAL 2002 AND EXPECT TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2001 WAS $173 MILLION COMPARED WITH

CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $737 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000. THE

INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF REPAYING $754

MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND ISSUING $500 MILLION OF 5 3/8% SENIOR NOTES

DURING FISCAL 2001.

WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS BORROWINGS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $1

BILLION. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE

PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH

A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR UP TO $800 MILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE

EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

WE USE CAPITAL, OPERATING AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET LEASES TO FINANCE ABOUT

20% OF OUR REAL ESTATE. OFF-BALANCE SHEET LEASES INCLUDE THREE LEASES CREATED

UNDER STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN

STORES, OFFICE BUILDINGS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. TWO OF THESE LEASE AGREEMENTS

INVOLVE A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY WHICH MEETS THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND IS NOT OWNED BY OR AFFILIATED WITH

THE COMPANY, ITS MANAGEMENT OR OFFICERS. OPERATING AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LEASES

ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS

REFLECTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET IN LONG-TERM DEBT. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2001,

OUR DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS 6.9%. IF THE ESTIMATED PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS UNDER THE OPERATING AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET LEASES WERE

CAPITALIZED, OUR DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WOULD INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY 30%.

22

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002 (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS).

(1)      CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF LONG-TERM DEBT COMPRISED PRIMARILY

OF $1 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES FURTHER DISCUSSED IN "QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK" AND FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE

PAYMENTS UNDER CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING OFF-BALANCE

SHEET LEASES, USED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

(2)      COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR CERTAIN BUSINESS

TRANSACTIONS AND GUARANTEES PROVIDED UNDER CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LEASES. WE ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR INSURANCE PROGRAMS, IMPORT

PURCHASES AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. UNDER CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET

LEASES FOR RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFICE BUILDINGS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS,

WE HAVE PROVIDED RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES. THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERMS

IS $799 MILLION. THE LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TERMS FROM 2004 THROUGH

2008 WITH SOME CARRYING RENEWAL OPTIONS THROUGH 2025. THE EXPIRATION

DATE OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES IN THE TABLE ABOVE IS BASED ON

THE ORIGINAL LEASE TERMS; HOWEVER, THE EXPIRATION PERIOD WILL CHANGE IF

THE LEASES ARE RENEWED.

AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, WE HAD $2.5 BILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, FUNDS

AVAILABLE FROM THE $1 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN

ALTERNATE SOURCES OF FINANCING SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE PRECISE EFFECT OF INFLATION ON

OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON SALES OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS, AND THAT REQUIRE JUDGMENT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS, AT THE TIME

THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE

ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS.

THE METHODOLOGY USED IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RETAILERS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WHEN WE

COLLECT PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE OWNERSHIP OF THE MERCHANDISE HAS PASSED OR

THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS A DEFERRED

REVENUE LIABILITY.

INVENTORY. OUR INVENTORY IS STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR

MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 94% VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD AND THE REMAINDER

UNDER THE COST METHOD.

23

UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD, INVENTORY IS STATED AT COST WHICH IS DETERMINED BY

APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORY. AS OUR

INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR

INVENTORY METHODOLOGY APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. RETAILERS WITH

MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS FREQUENTLY USE THIS METHOD. IN ADDITION, WE REDUCE OUR ENDING

INVENTORY VALUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK. THIS ESTIMATE IS

DETERMINED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL SHRINK LOSSES AND RECENT SHRINK

TRENDS.

SELF INSURANCE. WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL

LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION. WE MAINTAIN STOP LOSS

COVERAGE WITH THIRD PARTY INSURERS TO LIMIT OUR TOTAL EXPOSURE. OUR LIABILITY

REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE

SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS ESTABLISHED BASED

UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY

MANAGEMENT AND THIRD PARTY ACTUARIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE

LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED

ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY

OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES,

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE IMPACTED. IN AN ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE OUR RISKS OF

WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND GENERAL LIABILITY CLAIMS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

ENHANCED OUR STORE SAFETY PROCEDURES WITH SPI AND OTHER SAFETY AWARENESS

PROGRAMS.

USE OF ESTIMATES. WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO

THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS." UNDER SFAS 142, WHICH WE WILL ADOPT ON FEBRUARY 4, 2002, GOODWILL WILL

NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED AND WILL INSTEAD BE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY. WITHOUT THIS CHANGE, AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR GOODWILL IN FISCAL 2002

WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR GOODWILL AND

COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 142 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 144, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS," WHICH AMENDS ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION

NO. 30 ("APB 30"), "REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - REPORTING THE EFFECTS

OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL AND

INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS." SFAS 144 RETAINS THE

FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS OF SFAS 121, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF," FOR RECOGNIZING AND

MEASURING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE AND LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE, WHILE RESOLVING SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION

ISSUES. SFAS 144 RETAINS THE BASIC PROVISIONS OF APB 30 ON THE PRESENTATION OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE INCOME STATEMENT, BUT EXPANDS THE SCOPE TO

INCLUDE ALL DISTINGUISHABLE COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY THAT WILL BE ELIMINATED FROM

ONGOING OPERATIONS IN A DISPOSAL TRANSACTION. WE PLAN TO ADOPT SFAS 144 ON

FEBRUARY 4, 2002 AND DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

24

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE

CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE MAKE IN THIS REPORT, AND OTHER WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS

MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY, MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS"

WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. WORDS OR PHRASES SUCH AS

"SHOULD RESULT," "ARE EXPECTED TO," "WE ANTICIPATE," "WE ESTIMATE," "WE

PROJECT," "WE BELIEVE," OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE

DESCRIPTIONS OF OUR PLANS WITH RESPECT TO NEW STORE OPENINGS AND RELOCATIONS,

OUR PLANS TO ENTER NEW MARKETS AND EXPECTATIONS RELATING TO OUR CONTINUING

GROWTH. THESE STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT

COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND ITS PRESENT EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE; HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE

UNDUE RELIANCE ON SUCH STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE

THEY ARE MADE, AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF FUTURE EVENTS, NEW INFORMATION

OR OTHERWISE.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE EXPECTED RESULTS DESCRIBED IN THE

COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

-        ADVERSE OR UNANTICIPATED WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL LEVEL OF SALES AND SALES OF PARTICULAR LINES OF

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BUILDING MATERIALS, LUMBER AND LAWN AND GARDEN

SUPPLIES.

-        INSTABILITY OF COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF SOURCING CHANNELS, WHICH MAY

AFFECT THE PRICES THAT THE COMPANY PAYS FOR CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS,

SUCH AS LUMBER AND PLYWOOD, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO IMPROVE

ITS MIX OF MERCHANDISE. OUR COST OF SALES IS AFFECTED BY OUR ABILITY TO

MAINTAIN FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS.

OUR SOURCES OF SUPPLY MAY BE AFFECTED BY TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND CAPACITY, AND OTHER

FACTORS AFFECTING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

-        OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY-QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES TO

STAFF BOTH EXISTING AND NEW STORES.

-        CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE AVAILABILITY, ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND

OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING LOCAL ZONING AND LAND USE ISSUES,

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL

ESTATE MARKET.

-        GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH AFFECT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT AND HOME-BUILDING SPENDING, INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, THE

OVERALL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT

AND MORTGAGE FINANCING AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES.

-        THE IMPACT OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMERS,

LOCATIONS AND PRODUCTS AND IN OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.

OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING

MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES, LUMBER YARDS, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES AND

OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL OR NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, AS WELL AS

25

DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORES AND ANY OTHER CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION THAT

OFFERS PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE MAY FACE NEW TYPES OF COMPETITORS AS WE ENTER NEW MARKETS OR LINES

OF BUSINESS.

-        CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, TAX STATUTES OR REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE

REGULATIONS, AND UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISKS RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST

RATES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS. OUR OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS TO DECREASE THE

VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN THESE

RATES.

WE HAVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.

THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE FIXED RATE DEBT AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. WE

ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 5 3/8% SENIOR NOTES IN FISCAL 2001 MATURING ON APRIL 1,

2006 AND $500 MILLION OF 6 1/2% SENIOR NOTES IN FISCAL 1999 MATURING ON

SEPTEMBER 15, 2004. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2002, THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY

TRADED 5 3/8% AND 61/2% SENIOR NOTES WERE APPROXIMATELY $511 MILLION AND

$531 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE TWO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, BOTH

DESIGNED TO HEDGE THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY.

WE HAVE ONE AGREEMENT IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION THAT SWAPS FIXED

RATE INTEREST ON $300 MILLION OF OUR $500 MILLION 5 3/8% SENIOR NOTES FOR A

VARIABLE INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 30 BASIS POINTS AND EXPIRES ON

APRIL 1, 2006. WE HAVE ANOTHER AGREEMENT EXPIRING JANUARY 31, 2003 IN THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $690 MILLION THAT SWAPS A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE FOR A

FIXED RATE OF 6 3/4%, DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO

THE PORTFOLIO OF OUR PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD, WHICH IS SERVICED BY A THIRD

PARTY.
