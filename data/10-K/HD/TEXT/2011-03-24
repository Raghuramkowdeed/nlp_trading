OVERALL SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND MERCHANDISING TOOLS TO IMPROVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES.

LOGISTICS.

WE CONTINUED OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION IN

FISCAL 2010 TO ENSURE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY AND OPTIMAL TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE CONTINUED THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER

NETWORK TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES AND THE COMPLETION OF THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTER (RDC) ROLL OUT IN THE U.S. RDCS ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF

STORE PRODUCT NEEDS TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER, AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON ARRIVAL AT THE CENTER. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION, SIMPLIFIED ORDER PROCESSING AT SUPPLIERS AND LAST

MINUTE REALLOCATION FROM THE TIME THAT PRODUCT NEEDS AT STORES ARE DETERMINED TO ACTUAL REPLENISHMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES TO OUR

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, IN FISCAL 2010 WE ADDED 2.9 MILLION NET SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, PRIMARILY FOR NEW RDCS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010, WE OPERATED 30 BULK DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND 34 CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN

IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE.

OUR BUSINESS HAS ONE OF THE MOST

RECOGNIZED BRANDS IN NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE HOME DEPOT

®

TRADEMARK HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE

AND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS, E-COMMERCE, STORES AND BUSINESS. WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION OF TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY,

FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN PATENT PORTFOLIOS RELATING TO SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SEEK TO PATENT OR OTHERWISE PROTECT INNOVATIONS WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, ENERGY USAGE, SUPPLY CHAIN, PRODUCT SELECTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED PRIMARILY ON

CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO

SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS.

DUE TO THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED

BELOW INCLUDE THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE RELATED POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT

ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY

OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CAUSING OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND

OUR CONTROL  COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH

MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS,

DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH INSTALLERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE

OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER

LOYALTY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND

TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS

SERVICE LEVELS, SPENDING PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF

HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES, THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING LABOR

RELATIONS OR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS, AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM TO

MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF JOB SATISFACTION. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED

ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES

AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND

ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES

MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND

DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP

RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS (PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF CONTINUING ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE WORLD), SUPPLIERS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, SHIPPING INTERRUPTIONS OR COST, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS

UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

ANY SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY DATA

SECURITY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SECURED DATA ARE ADEQUATE

TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS

AND MANAGE TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DATA IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS. WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT

PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY

CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHILE SIMPLIFYING CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A MORE

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYING NEW WEB-BASED TOOLS AND

SERVICES, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE

DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION WITHIN OUR LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK,

INCLUDING DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INVENTORY IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOST SALES OR DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS

COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN A LARGE

NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND REFORMS, AS WELL AS INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. CHANGES IN, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS, THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, TAXES, ENERGY COSTS OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF

DOING BUSINESS OR IMPACT OUR STORE OPERATIONS. HEALTHCARE REFORM UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 ENACTED IN MARCH 2010 COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS AND OUR

ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS UNDER OUR BENEFIT PLANS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON

FAVORABLE TERMS, IF NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM

THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A STRONG

INVESTMENT GRADE RATING AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2010, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED

DUE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY

MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT

BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE

SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS,

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES,

GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FCPA AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE

CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICE BUSINESS, WE COULD BE

SUBJECT TO FINES AND LAWSUITS.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND

PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY OR PROVIDE

PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THESE SERVICES, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS, AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND

INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVENTORIES, LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS

AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED

OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN

EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IN JULY 2005, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS HANDLING, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCEEDING, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, THREE PURPORTED, BUT UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE

FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE HOME DEPOT FUTUREBUILDER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN VIOLATION OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY

ACT OF 1974 (ERISA) IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS RETURN-TO-VENDOR AND STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE JOINED INTO ONE CASE IN 2007, AND THE JOINT AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS CERTIFICATION AS A CLASS ACTION, UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES, COSTS, ATTORNEYS FEES AND EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ON JUNE 7, 2010, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE HOME DEPOTS MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS

THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON JUNE 28, 2010, PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL WITH THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY WAS CONTACTED BY

PROSECUTORS IN THE FOUR COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT (SCAQMD) AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES REGARDING ALLEGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY SOLD PRODUCTS IN THOSE COUNTIES WITH VOC (VOLATILE ORGANIC

COMPOUND) LEVELS IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS PERMITTED BY SCAQMD RULES. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENA.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA

FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 30, 2011 (FISCAL 2010), WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF $3.3 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.01 COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS OF $2.7 BILLION

AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.57 FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010 (FISCAL 2009).

THE RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2010

INCLUDED A $51 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE RELATED TO THE EXTENSION OF OUR GUARANTEE OF A SENIOR SECURED LOAN OF HD SUPPLY, INC. (THE HD SUPPLY GUARANTEE EXTENSION). THE RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL STRATEGIC ACTIONS

INITIATED IN FISCAL 2008. THESE STRATEGIC ACTIONS RESULTED IN STORE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES RELATED TO THE CLOSING OF 15 UNDERPERFORMING U.S. STORES AND THE REMOVAL OF APPROXIMATELY 50 STORES FROM OUR NEW STORE PIPELINE, BUSINESS RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES RELATED TO THE EXIT OF OUR EXPO, THD DESIGN CENTER, YARDBIRDS AND HD BATH BUSINESSES (THE EXITED BUSINESSES) AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF SUPPORT FUNCTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES).

THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN PRETAX RATIONALIZATION CHARGES OF $146 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THE RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2009 ALSO INCLUDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $163 MILLION TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY, INC. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2009 INCLUDED

EARNINGS OF $41 MILLION FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

WE REPORTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $3.3 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.01 FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF

$2.6 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.55 FOR FISCAL 2009. EXCLUDING THE HD SUPPLY GUARANTEE EXTENSION CHARGE FROM OUR FISCAL 2010 RESULTS, AND THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY FROM OUR FISCAL 2009 RESULTS, EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $3.4 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.03 FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.8

BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.66 FOR FISCAL 2009.

NET SALES INCREASED 2.8% TO $68.0 BILLION

FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM $66.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASED 2.9% IN FISCAL 2010, DRIVEN BY A 2.4% INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND A 0.5% INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE AVERAGE TICKET TO

$51.93. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR OUR U.S. STORES INCREASED 2.5% IN FISCAL 2010.

IN FISCAL 2010, WE FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING FOUR KEY

INITIATIVES.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

 OUR FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES,

PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS. THE ROLL OUT OF OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST TRAINING TO ALL STORE ASSOCIATES AND SUPPORT STAFF IN FISCAL 2009 HAS BROUGHT SIMPLIFICATION AND FOCUS ACROSS THE BUSINESS, AND WE REPEATED AND REFRESHED THE

CUSTOMERS FIRST TRAINING DURING FISCAL 2010. THE CUSTOMERS FIRST PROGRAM IS PART OF OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS IN OUR STORES, AND WE CONTINUED TO SEE THE BENEFIT OF THIS TRAINING IN IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE RATINGS

FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009. ALSO IN FISCAL 2010, WE COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR FIRST PHONE, A NEW HAND HELD DEVICE THAT PROVIDES MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, PRODUCT LOCATION AND MOBILE CHECKOUT. THE CORE

PURPOSE OF THIS NEW DEVICE IS TO REDUCE TASKING TIME FOR OUR STORE ASSOCIATES TO ALLOW THEM MORE TIME TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE ENDED FISCAL 2010 WITH MORE THAN HALF OF OUR STORE PAYROLL ALLOCATED TO CUSTOMER FACING ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN

TASKING ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE A CUSTOMER FACING STORE PAYROLL TARGET OF 60%, AND WE BELIEVE WE WILL ACHIEVE THAT BY 2013.

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

 OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT AUTHORITY IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, INCLUDING INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. IN FISCAL 2010, WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON OUR MERCHANDISING TOOLS IN THE U.S. THAT

HELPED US MANAGE MARKDOWN AND CLEARANCE ACTIVITY AND BETTER CONTROL INVENTORY. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO WAS 4.13 TIMES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 4.06 TIMES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUED TO FORM STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO BRING A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DEPARTMENTS.

PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

 OUR APPROACH TO DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY STARTS WITH

DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION FOCUSED ON BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLY CHAIN, AS WELL AS BUILDING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND TOTAL VALUE RETURNED TO

SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010, WE COMPLETED THE ROLL OUT OF OUR RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS (RDCS) AND NOW HAVE 19 RDCS THAT SERVE 100% OF OUR U.S. STORES. ALSO DURING FISCAL 2010, WE

REPURCHASED 80.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $2.6 BILLION, AND ON FEBRUARY 22, 2011 WE ANNOUNCED A SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO 25 CENTS PER SHARE.

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL

 OUR FOCUS ON INTERCONNECTED RETAIL IS BASED ON THE VIEW THAT PROVIDING A SEAMLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS WILL BE A CRITICAL ENABLER FOR FUTURE

SUCCESS. OUR MULTIPLE CHANNEL FOCUS IS ALLOWING US TO GREATLY EXPAND OUR ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE, AND WE ARE MAKING THE INVESTMENT TO BUILD THESE CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING THE ROLL OUT OF BUY ON-LINE, PICK-UP IN STORE NEXT YEAR. WE ARE

COMMITTED TO HAVING A BEST-IN-CLASS WEBSITE, AND DURING FISCAL 2010 OUR SITE WAS NAMED AS A MOST IMPROVED WEBSITE FOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY FORESEE, A LEADING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ANALYTICS FIRM.

WE OPENED EIGHT NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2010, INCLUDING ONE RELOCATION, AND CLOSED THREE STORES, BRINGING OUR TOTAL STORE COUNT AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010 TO

2,248. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2010, A TOTAL OF 272 OF THESE STORES, OR 12.1%, WERE LOCATED IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA COMPARED TO 268 STORES, OR 11.9%, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009.

WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2010. WE USED THIS CASH FLOW ALONG WITH CASH ON HAND TO FUND $2.6 BILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES, PAY $1.6 BILLION OF

DIVIDENDS AND FUND $1.1 BILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 46.1% COMPARED TO

44.7% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS (COMPUTED ON NET OPERATING PROFIT AFTER TAX FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS AND THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY) WAS 12.8% FOR

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 10.7% FOR FISCAL 2009. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2009. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR

CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS 12.7% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 11.1% FOR FISCAL 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR

FISCAL 2010 INCREASED 2.8% TO $68.0 BILLION FROM $66.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2010 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASED 2.9% FOR FISCAL 2010

COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF 6.6% FOR FISCAL 2009.

THE INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2010 REFLECTS A NUMBER OF FACTORS. WE

EXPERIENCED POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN 11 OF OUR 13 DEPARTMENTS FOR FISCAL 2010. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR OUR LUMBER, TOOLS, ELECTRICAL, INDOOR GARDEN, OUTDOOR GARDEN AND KITCHEN/BATH PRODUCT CATEGORIES WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR

FISCAL 2010. THE INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES ALSO REFLECTS A 2.4% INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND A 0.5% INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE AVERAGE TICKET TO $51.93.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SALES PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN, AND COULD CONTINUE TO BE, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS

MARKETS. WE ESTIMATE OUR SHARE OF THE U.S. HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET IS APPROXIMATELY 26% USING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAUS NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, OR NAICS, 4441 CLASSIFICATION FOR BUILDING MATERIAL AND SUPPLIES DEALERS.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT

INCREASED 4.0% TO $23.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM $22.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 34.3% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 33.9% FOR FISCAL 2009, AN INCREASE OF 40 BASIS POINTS. OUR U.S. STORES

EXPERIENCED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN EXPANSION IN FISCAL 2010 AS WE REALIZED BENEFITS FROM BETTER PRODUCT ASSORTMENT MANAGEMENT THROUGH OUR PORTFOLIO APPROACH AND LEVERAGING OF OUR NEWLY DEVELOPED MERCHANDISING TOOLS. LOWER LEVELS OF CLEARANCE INVENTORY

IN OUR STORES FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO LAST YEAR ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EXPANSION. ADDITIONALLY, WE REALIZED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN EXPANSION FROM OUR NON-U.S. BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY CANADA, DUE PRIMARILY TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD.

OPERATING EXPENSES

SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) DECREASED 0.3% TO $15.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM $15.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 23.3% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 24.0% FOR FISCAL 2009.

EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 23.9% FOR FISCAL 2009. THE DECREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2010 REFLECTS EXPENSE LEVERAGE IN THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES ENVIRONMENT AND

LOWER PAYROLL AND OTHER EXPENSES.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION DECREASED 5.3% TO $1.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM $1.7 BILLION

FOR FISCAL 2009. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.4% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 2.6% FOR FISCAL 2009. THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SMALLER DEPRECIABLE

FIXED ASSET BASE COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, ARISING FROM FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 21.6% TO $5.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM $4.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES

WAS 8.6% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 7.3% FOR FISCAL 2009. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES FROM THE RESULTS OF FISCAL 2009, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 18.0% FOR FISCAL 2010.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

IN FISCAL 2010, WE RECOGNIZED $566 MILLION OF INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, COMPARED TO $821 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.8% FOR FISCAL 2010

COMPARED TO 1.2% FOR FISCAL 2009. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, REFLECTS A $51 MILLION CHARGE IN FISCAL 2010 RELATED TO THE HD SUPPLY GUARANTEE EXTENSION AND A $163 MILLION CHARGE IN FISCAL 2009 TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY. EXCLUDING

THESE CHARGES, INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.8% FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO 1.0% FOR FISCAL 2009. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $44 MILLION BENEFIT ARISING FROM FAVORABLE IRS GUIDANCE RESULTING IN THE REVERSAL OF AN

INTEREST ACCRUAL DURING FISCAL 2010, A LOWER COST OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS THAN LAST YEAR AND AN INTEREST BENEFIT ARISING FROM CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX SETTLEMENTS.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING

OPERATIONS INCREASED TO 36.7% FOR FISCAL 2010 FROM 34.2% FOR FISCAL 2009. FISCAL 2009 INCLUDED BENEFITS ARISING FROM A FAVORABLE FOREIGN TAX SETTLEMENT AND A REALIGNMENT OF OUR FOREIGN CORPORATE STRUCTURE.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.01 FOR FISCAL 2010 AND $1.55 FOR FISCAL 2009. EXCLUDING THE HD SUPPLY GUARANTEE EXTENSION CHARGE FROM OUR FISCAL 2010 RESULTS, AND THE

RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY FROM OUR FISCAL 2009 RESULTS, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2010 WERE $2.03 COMPARED TO $1.66 FOR FISCAL 2009, AN INCREASE OF 22.3%. DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2010 REFLECT $0.04 OF BENEFIT FROM REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2009 CONSIST OF EARNINGS

OF $41 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

TO PROVIDE

CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE $51 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE RELATED TO THE HD SUPPLY

GUARANTEE EXTENSION AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NET SALES FROM EXITED

BUSINESSES DURING THE PERIOD FROM CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT TO ACTUAL CLOSING, AND THE CHARGES TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY OF $163 MILLION IN EACH OF FISCAL 2009 AND 2008 AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BETTER ENABLE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH MEANINGFUL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO EVENTS OF UNUSUAL NATURE OR FREQUENCY THAT IMPACT THE

COMPARABILITY OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008)

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2009

DECREASED 7.2% TO $66.2 BILLION FROM $71.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WELL AS THE NET IMPACT OF FEWER OPEN STORES IN FISCAL 2009 VERSUS

FISCAL 2008. TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 6.6% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF 8.7% FOR FISCAL 2008.

THERE WERE A NUMBER

OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, HOUSING AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT, AND CONSUMERS WERE CHALLENGED DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING HIGHER

UNEMPLOYMENT. WE SAW RELATIVE STRENGTH IN OUR BUILDING MATERIALS, FLOORING, PAINT, PLUMBING AND GARDEN/SEASONAL PRODUCT CATEGORIES AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN THESE AREAS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2009. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR

OUR LUMBER, HARDWARE, ELECTRICAL, KITCHEN/BATH AND MILLWORK PRODUCT CATEGORIES WERE BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2009. IN FISCAL 2009, WE ALSO SAW SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST ALL CURRENCIES. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE

RATES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR TOTAL COMPANY SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $565 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 6.6% TO $22.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $24.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF

NET SALES WAS 33.9% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 33.7% FOR FISCAL 2008, AN INCREASE OF 22 BASIS POINTS. THROUGH OUR FOCUSED BAY PORTFOLIO APPROACH, OUR U.S. MERCHANTS CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE NEW LOWER PRICES WHILE GROWING OVERALL GROSS MARGIN.

ADDITIONALLY, GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKDOWNS AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008.

OPERATING EXPENSES

SG&A DECREASED 10.9% TO $15.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $17.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES,

SG&A WAS 24.0% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHARGES, SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 23.9% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 23.7% FOR FISCAL 2008. OUR SG&A RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF A NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE

SALES ENVIRONMENT, OFFSET BY A LOWER COST OF CREDIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND SOLID EXPENSE CONTROL. FOR FISCAL 2009, THE PENETRATION OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES WAS 25.1% COMPARED TO 28.1% FOR FISCAL 2008.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION DECREASED 4.4% TO $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.6% FOR FISCAL 2009 AND 2.5% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 10.2% TO $4.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $4.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.3% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 6.1% FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, OPERATING

INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.5% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 7.4% FOR FISCAL 2008.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

IN FISCAL 2009, WE RECOGNIZED $821 MILLION OF INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, COMPARED TO $769 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.2% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 1.1% FOR FISCAL 2008. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, REFLECTS A $163 MILLION CHARGE IN EACH OF FISCAL 2009 AND 2008 TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGES, INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.0% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 0.9% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED TO 34.2% FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM 35.6% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECTS BENEFITS ARISING FROM A FAVORABLE FOREIGN TAX SETTLEMENT AND A

REALIGNMENT OF OUR FOREIGN CORPORATE STRUCTURE.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.55 FOR FISCAL 2009 AND $1.37 FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE

WRITE-DOWNS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2009 WERE $1.66 COMPARED TO $1.78 FOR FISCAL 2008, A DECREASE OF 6.7%.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2009 CONSIST OF EARNINGS OF $41 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $52 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2008, IN EACH CASE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF

WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2010, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $5.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS AND OTHER NET WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EARNINGS.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS $1.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $755 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LOWER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2010, WE SPENT $1.1 BILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: 34% FOR CORE

TECHNOLOGY, 18% FOR MERCHANDISING AND OPERATIONS, 17% FOR MAINTENANCE, 9% FOR NEW STORES AND 22% FOR OTHER INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2010, WE ADDED EIGHT NEW STORES, INCLUDING ONE RELOCATION.

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS $4.5 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $2.4 BILLION MORE IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK THAN IN FISCAL 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $998 MILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND A $745 MILLION DECREASE IN REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL 2010.

WE REPURCHASED 80.9 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $2.6 BILLION IN FISCAL 2010 AND 7.7 MILLION SHARES FOR $213 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 834.4 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $30.1 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011, $9.9 BILLION REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.0 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY

WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.0 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011, THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS OR THE RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES IN JULY 2013 AND CONTAINS

VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS, AND THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

WE USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF

THE END OF FISCAL 2010, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 46.1% COMPARED TO 44.7% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009.

AS OF JANUARY 30,

2011, WE GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED AMORTIZING TERM LOAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO $1.0 BILLION AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF NONPAYMENT BY HD SUPPLY. AS REPORTED IN THE

QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q OF HD SUPPLY FOR THE PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2010, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THIS TERM LOAN AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2010 WAS $940 MILLION. THE GUARANTEED LOAN IS COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN ASSETS OF HD SUPPLY. THE

ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE OF THE GUARANTEE WAS AUGUST 30, 2012. ON MARCH 19, 2010, WE AMENDED THE GUARANTEE TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE TO APRIL 1, 2014. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AT AUGUST 30, 2007 WAS $16 MILLION AND WAS

RECORDED AS A LIABILITY IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THE EXTENSION OF THE GUARANTEE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE TO $67 MILLION, RESULTING IN A $51 MILLION CHARGE TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2010.

AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011, WE HAD $545 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL

MARKETS AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL

YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF FISCAL 2010, WE REPAID $1.0 BILLION OF 5.20% SENIOR NOTES THAT WERE DUE MARCH 1,

2011. WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO REPAY THE 5.20% SENIOR NOTES AND PLAN TO REFINANCE THIS DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011.

AT

JANUARY 30, 2011, WE HAD OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THAT EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 16, 2013 WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION THAT SWAP FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $1.25 BILLION 5.25%

SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 259 BASIS POINTS. AT JANUARY 30, 2011, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS AN ASSET OF $47 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE THE

AGREEMENTS.

IN MAY 2010, WE ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION, ACCOUNTED

FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT TO REFINANCE DEBT MATURING IN FISCAL 2011. AT JANUARY 30, 2011, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THIS

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGREEMENT WAS A LIABILITY OF $2 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE PAID TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 3.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2020 AT A DISCOUNT OF $1 MILLION AND $500 MILLION OF 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2040 AT A

DISCOUNT OF $1 MILLION (TOGETHER, THE SEPTEMBER 2010 ISSUANCE). THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE SEPTEMBER 2010 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO REFINANCE OUR 4.625% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED AUGUST 15, 2010 IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

$1.0 BILLION.

IN FISCAL 2009 AND 2010, WE ENTERED INTO FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH A COMBINED NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.0

BILLION TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 2010 ISSUANCE, WHICH WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. UPON THE SEPTEMBER 2010 ISSUANCE, WE PAID $193 MILLION TO SETTLE THESE FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS. THIS AMOUNT, NET OF INCOME TAXES, IS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2010.

IN MARCH 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, THAT EXPIRES ON MARCH 1, 2016 WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500

MILLION THAT SWAPS FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $500 MILLION 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2016 FOR VARIABLE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 300 BASIS POINTS.

EXCLUDES $599 MILLION OF NONCURRENT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE USED, AT TIMES, TO MANAGE OUR FIXED/FLOATING RATE DEBT PORTFOLIO. AT JANUARY 30,

2011, AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 87% OF OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AND 13% WAS FLOATING-RATE DEBT. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE INTEREST COSTS OF FLOATING-RATE DEBT

WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $9.3 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE

AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.8 BILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND

DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT

OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUES

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF

ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS

AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE

OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

(FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 80% VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE US, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS,

FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL

VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS

CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2010 OR 2009.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED

IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS.

SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR

DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS

AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SELF-INSURANCE

WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, MEDICAL, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITY REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST

OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A REGULAR BASIS

TO ENSURE THAT THE LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, OR FLUCTUATIONS IN

PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF

PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN

COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING

EXPENSE IN SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENTS DECISION

TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS

PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH

INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENTS ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS

IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO

RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

MARKET COMPETITION AND INFLATION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE STORES WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS OF OWNED LOCATIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SUBLEASE INCOME AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE FOR LEASED LOCATIONS.

AS PART OF OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, WE RECORDED NO ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009 AND RECORDED $580 MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL 2008. ALSO AS PART OF OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES,

WE RECORDED NO LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2010 AND RECORDED $84 MILLION AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. A 10% DECREASE IN ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME AND A 10% INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ALSO

RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON OTHER CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT DO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY

OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED

USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET COMPETITION,

INFLATION AND DISCOUNT RATES. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE REPORTING UNITS TESTED WOULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE

USED WOULD ALSO RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO 20 YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS

WARRANT. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

RECENT

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDMENTS TO FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R) (FASB ASC

810-10), WHICH CLARIFIES THAT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ENTITYS PURPOSE AND DESIGN AND A COMPANYS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY

THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENTITYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. FASB ASC 810-10 REQUIRES ONGOING REASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND ELIMINATES THE QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY

CONCEPT. FASB ASC 810-10 ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT A COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK EXPOSURE DUE TO THAT INVOLVEMENT. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING

PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2009, FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD, AND FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS THEREAFTER. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY THAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO

DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS (WHETHER PAID OR UNPAID) ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES).

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE RETAINS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

COMPANY. BOTH THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT). UNDER

THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 30,

2011 BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 IN PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS

THE

HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT INC.S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR

AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF

ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 30,

2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF

JANUARY 30, 2011 AND JANUARY 31, 2010, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 30,

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) OPERATE THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES

AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY 105,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TO 40,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS,

DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY WAS OPERATING 2,248 STORES, WHICH INCLUDED 1,976 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO AND THE TERRITORIES OF

THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND GUAM (U.S.), 179 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CANADA, 85 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN MEXICO AND 8 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CHINA. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL YEAR

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31. FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 30, 2011

(FISCAL 2010), JANUARY 31, 2010 (FISCAL 2009) AND FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008) INCLUDE 52 WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN THIS NOTE 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANYS CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HIGH-GRADE COMMERCIAL

PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT

CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE RELATED RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDER EXPIRES IN 2018, WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS

CUSTOMERS

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE CARDS AND THE PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR ARE INCLUDED IN

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A). THE SUM OF THE THREE IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY AS THE COST OF CREDIT OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM

CUSTOMERS WERE $42 MILLION AND $38 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 AND JANUARY 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2010 OR 2009.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS

ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, RECORD

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST

METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS

OF THE END OF FISCAL 2010 OR 2009.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND

DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR

ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF

INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THE

COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME

OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF THOSE POSITIONS

ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED. RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX POSITIONS ARE MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. CHANGES IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE

IN JUDGMENT OCCURS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES FOR THESE

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON

HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME IS

RECOGNIZED BASED UPON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION PATTERNS AND REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF GIFT CARDS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDEMPTION BY THE CUSTOMER IS REMOTE. DURING FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

$46 MILLION, $40 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. THIS INCOME IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AS A REDUCTION IN SG&A.

SERVICES REVENUE

NET SALES INCLUDE

SERVICES REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION, HOME MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS. IN THESE PROGRAMS, THE CUSTOMER SELECTS AND PURCHASES MATERIAL FOR A PROJECT AND THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES PROFESSIONAL

INSTALLATION. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANYS STORES. UNDER CERTAIN PROGRAMS, WHEN THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES THE INSTALLATION OF A PROJECT AND THE SUBCONTRACTOR PROVIDES MATERIAL AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION, BOTH THE

MATERIAL AND LABOR ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES REVENUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETE.

ALL

PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF SERVICES ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. SERVICES REVENUE WAS $2.7 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, MEDICAL, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE CLAIMS.

THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES.

PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF

PURCHASES.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN

OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008, GROSS ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $864 MILLION, $897 MILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND IS INCLUDED IN SG&A. SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE ADVERTISING

CO-OP ALLOWANCES WERE $90 MILLION, $105 MILLION AND $107 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

COST OF SALES

COST OF SALES INCLUDES THE ACTUAL COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD AND SERVICES

PERFORMED, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS TO THE COMPANYS STORES, LOCATIONS OR CUSTOMERS, THE OPERATING COST OF THE COMPANYS SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS OFFERED

THROUGH THE COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

THE COST OF HANDLING AND SHIPPING MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANYS STORES,

LOCATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE CUSTOMER IS CLASSIFIED AS SG&A. THE COST OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING, INCLUDING INTERNAL COSTS AND PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES, CLASSIFIED AS SG&A WAS $438 MILLION, $426 MILLION AND

$501 MILLION IN FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES

COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENTS ASSUMPTIONS OF

CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE

IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

AS PART OF ITS RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, THE COMPANY RECORDED NO ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009 AND RECORDED $580 MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL 2008. ALSO AS PART OF ITS RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES, THE COMPANY RECORDED NO LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2010 AND RECORDED $84 MILLION AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE

CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER

THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF

EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO 20 YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE

DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT MATERIAL

FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 OR 2008.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE PER SHARE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED DURING FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $6.70, $6.61 AND $6.46, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS WAS DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

DURING

FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM, INCLUDING A NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM, FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA. ALONG WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA FROM THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET USING A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD. AS OF THE END OF

FISCAL 2008, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM AND RELATED CONVERSION TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD FOR CANADIAN RETAIL OPERATIONS WAS COMPLETE.

THE NEW ERP SYSTEM ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO UTILIZE THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL RESULT IN GREATER PRECISION IN THE COSTING OF INVENTORIES AND A BETTER MATCHING OF COST

OF SALES WITH REVENUE GENERATED. THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE ON THE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCES WAS NOT MATERIAL. PRIOR TO THE INVENTORY SYSTEM CONVERSION, THE COMPANY COULD NOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGE TO THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD, AND THEREFORE, COULD NOT RETROACTIVELY APPLY THE CHANGE TO PERIODS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2008.

HD SUPPLY DISPOSITION

ON AUGUST 30,

2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY, INC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 360-10, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED THE RESULTS OF HD SUPPLY AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. SETTLEMENT OF

WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY RESULTED IN EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $41 MILLION, NET OF TAX, IN FISCAL 2009 AND A LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $52 MILLION, NET OF TAX, IN FISCAL 2008.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, THE COMPANY PURCHASED A 12.5% EQUITY INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED HD SUPPLY FOR $325 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2008, THE

COMPANY DETERMINED ITS 12.5% EQUITY INTEREST IN HD SUPPLY WAS IMPAIRED AND RECORDED A $163 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-DOWN THE INVESTMENT. IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY DETERMINED ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN HD SUPPLY WAS FURTHER IMPAIRED AND RECORDED AN

ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF $163 MILLION TO WRITE-DOWN THE REMAINING INVESTMENT. THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, THE COMPANY GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED AMORTIZING TERM LOAN OF HD SUPPLY. THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO $1.0 BILLION AND ANY UNPAID

INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF NONPAYMENT BY HD SUPPLY. AS REPORTED IN THE QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q OF HD SUPPLY FOR THE PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2010, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THIS TERM LOAN AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2010 WAS $940 MILLION. THE

GUARANTEED LOAN IS COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN ASSETS OF HD SUPPLY. THE ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE OF THE GUARANTEE WAS AUGUST 30, 2012. ON MARCH 19, 2010, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE GUARANTEE TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE TO APRIL 1, 2014.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AT AUGUST 30, 2007 WAS $16 MILLION AND WAS RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THE EXTENSION OF THE GUARANTEE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE TO $67 MILLION, RESULTING

IN A $51 MILLION CHARGE TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2010.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE

EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING AND CAPITAL LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

AT JANUARY 30, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT

VARIOUS DATES FROM 2011 TO 2028. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES ARE IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE

EXPIRATION PERIOD IS TOO SHORT TO BE ASSURED OF UTILIZATION. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL

VALUATION ALLOWANCES RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES AT JANUARY 30, 2011 AND JANUARY 31, 2010 WERE $21 MILLION AND $15 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS SALE OF HD SUPPLY, THE COMPANY INCURRED A TAX LOSS, RESULTING IN A NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER OF APPROXIMATELY $397 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011. PORTIONS OF THE NET CAPITAL LOSS

CARRYOVER WILL EXPIRE IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2015 IF NOT USED. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OF THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL BE REALIZED BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE

ADEQUATE CAPITAL GAIN INCOME DURING THE CARRYOVER PERIOD. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $45 MILLION HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY HAD

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $30 MILLION AND $65 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 30, 2011 AND JANUARY 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WILL EXPIRE IN 2020. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WILL BE REALIZED BASED ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME DURING THE CARRYFORWARD PERIOD. THEREFORE, NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE

OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN

INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE COMPANYS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANYS U.S. FEDERAL AND CANADIAN TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2007 ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY THE IRS AND THE CANADIAN TAX AUTHORITIES. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AND

OTHER FOREIGN AUDITS COVERING TAX YEARS 2003 TO 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY INCOME TAX AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE IRS AND IN CERTAIN STATES WILL BE AGREED UPON WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED APPROXIMATELY $63 MILLION OF

THE RESERVE FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A SHORT-TERM LIABILITY IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS THAN THESE AMOUNTS, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECONCILIATIONS OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE AS
