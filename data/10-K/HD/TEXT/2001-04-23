THE HOME DEPOT, INC. IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER AND THE

SECOND LARGEST RETAILER IN THE UNITED STATES BASED ON NET SALES VOLUME FOR

RETAIL BUSINESSES

HOME DEPOT STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY FOR HOME DEPOT STORES IS TO OFFER A

BROAD ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES

USING HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE, SERVICE-ORIENTED PERSONNEL AND AGGRESSIVE

ADVERTISING. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR MARKETING

APPROACH AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. WE REGULARLY CHECK

OUR COMPETITORS' PRICES TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH

MARKET.

CUSTOMERS. HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.

-        DO-IT-YOURSELF (D-I-Y) CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR

OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE IN-STORE

EXPERTISE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER MANY

D-I-Y "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE

VENDORS.

-        BUY-IT-YOURSELF (B-I-Y) CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND

HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR

INSTALLATION. WE OFFER B-I-Y CUSTOMERS INSTALLATION SERVICES

FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS.

-        PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL

REPAIR REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND TRADESMEN. IN MANY

STORES WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL

SERVICES; DEDICATED STAFF; EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE SELECTIONS;

AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE

INCREASE SALES.

PRODUCTS. A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS APPROXIMATELY 40,000 TO 50,000

PRODUCT ITEMS, INCLUDING VARIATIONS IN COLOR AND SIZE. EACH STORE CARRIES A

WIDE SELECTION OF HIGH-QUALITY AND NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND NAME

MERCHANDISE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF EACH MAJOR

PRODUCT GROUP FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

WE BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. NO

SINGLE VENDOR ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN SIX PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL PURCHASES, AND WE

ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE VENDOR. MOST OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS PURCHASED

DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, WHICH ELIMINATES "MIDDLEMAN" COSTS. WE BELIEVE

THAT COMPETITIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY

PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OVERSEAS MANUFACTURERS, WHICH GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS A

BROADER SELECTION OF PRODUCTS AND BETTER VALUES WHILE ENHANCING OUR GROSS

MARGIN. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY TO IDENTIFY

OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE ITEMS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. THIS ENABLES US TO

IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY, TO IMPORT PRODUCTS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER AT A LOWER PRICE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTY IMPORTERS. WE CURRENTLY SOURCE PRODUCTS FROM MORE

THAN 260 MANUFACTURERS IN APPROXIMATELY 35 COUNTRIES.

TO COMPLEMENT THE ESTABLISHED NATIONAL BRAND NAME PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WE HAVE

FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH VENDOR PARTNERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER BRAND

NAMES THAT ARE ONLY OFFERED THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT. AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR

2000, WE OFFERED PRODUCTS UNDER MORE THAN 30 PROPRIETARY AND OTHER EXCLUSIVE

BRANDS, INCLUDING THOMASVILLE(TM) KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETS; RIDGID(R)

POWER TOOLS; BEHR PREMIUM PLUS(R) PAINT; MILL'S PRIDE(R) CABINETS; GE

SMARTWATER(TM) WATER HEATERS; AND VIGORO(R) FERTILIZER. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY

CONSIDER ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ALIGNMENTS WITH OTHER VENDORS TO OFFER PRODUCTS

UNDER PROPRIETARY BRAND NAMES. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS

OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE UNDER EXISTING

PROPRIETARY BRANDS.

INSTALLED SALES SERVICES. HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLED SALES

PROGRAMS THROUGH ITS AT-HOME SERVICES BUSINESS. THIS SERVICE TARGETS THE B-I-Y

CUSTOMER WHO WILL SELECT AND PURCHASE MATERIALS FOR A PROJECT AND PREFERS THE

COMPANY TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. WE IMPLEMENT OUR INSTALLED SALES

PROGRAMS THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 6,800 INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS IN THE

U.S. AND CANADA. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF CARPETING, HARD

FLOORING, CABINETS, SOLID SURFACE COUNTERTOPS, EXTERIOR DOORS, GARAGE DOORS,

ROOFING, SIDING AND WINDOWS. DURING FISCAL 2000, WE ALSO BEGAN TESTING A

RESIDENTIAL HVAC PROGRAM IN TENNESSEE AND GEORGIA AND PLAN TO EXPAND THE

OFFERING DURING FISCAL 2001.

IN-STORE INITIATIVES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR BUSINESS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES

TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY, THEREBY INCREASING SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE

IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED A NUMBER OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES IN HOME DEPOT STORES

DURING FISCAL 2000, INCLUDING.

-        PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMER INITIATIVE. WE ARE COMMITTED

TO BEING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REPAIR REMODELERS, CARPENTERS,

PLUMBERS, PAINTERS, ELECTRICIANS, BUILDING MAINTENANCE

PROFESSIONALS AND DESIGNERS. DURING FISCAL 2000, WE CONTINUED

TO EXPAND AN INITIATIVE THAT ADDS SERVICE-RELATED PROGRAMS TO

OUR STORES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES TO

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. STORES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM

ADD ASSOCIATES AT A SALES DESK DEDICATED TO PROVIDING MORE

PERSONALIZED SERVICE TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

MANAGING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING AND FILLING ORDERS FOR PICK-UP

OR SAME-DAY DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE HOURS WHEN

PROFESSIONALS TYPICALLY SHOP, THESE STORES ASSIGN SALES

ASSOCIATES IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS.

TO BETTER SERVE OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO INCREASE

QUANTITIES OF EXISTING PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PURCHASED BY

3

6

PROFESSIONALS IN BULK QUANTITIES AND OFFER CERTAIN ITEMS IN

EACH DEPARTMENT PACKAGED IN BULK TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SAVINGS.

WHILE AIMED AT THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER, THIS PROGRAM ALSO

ENABLES US TO BETTER SERVE OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMER WITH IMPROVED

CUSTOMER SERVICE, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES,

EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS AND ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE. THROUGH

THIS INITIATIVE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES IN SERVING

OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN MANY

OF OUR STORES WITHOUT MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS. BY THE END

OF FISCAL 2000, WE HAD EXPANDED THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER

INITIATIVE INTO 29 MARKETS WITH APPROXIMATELY 165 STORES. WE

ANTICIPATE THAT DURING FISCAL YEAR 2001, WE WILL EXPAND THIS

INITIATIVE TO APPROXIMATELY 335 ADDITIONAL STORES.

-        SPI INITIATIVE. WE BEGAN TESTING THE SERVICE PERFORMANCE

IMPROVEMENT, OR "SPI," INITIATIVE DURING FISCAL 2000 IN

APPROXIMATELY 51 STORES IN THREE MARKETS. THE PROGRAM FOCUSES

ON MAKING IT EASIER TO SHOP IN OUR STORES WHILE EMPHASIZING

SAFETY AND IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE. STORES THAT HAVE

IMPLEMENTED THE INITIATIVE ASSIGN SOME ASSOCIATES SPECIFIC

TASKS WHILE OTHERS FOCUS ON ASSISTING CUSTOMERS.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE STORES SCHEDULE ASSOCIATES TO RECEIVE

SHIPMENTS AND STOCK MERCHANDISE WHEN OUR STORES ARE CLOSED OR

DURING HOURS WHEN THEY HAVE FEWER CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE THIS

SEPARATION OF ASSIGNMENTS WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE BETTER

CUSTOMER SERVICE WHILE IMPROVING LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, MANAGING

INVENTORY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND INCREASING SALES. WE CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATE ROLLING THIS PROGRAM OUT TO MOST OF OUR STORES

DURING FISCAL 2001.

-        APPLIANCE SALES. DURING FISCAL 2000, WE COMPLETED THE

ROLL-OUT OF OUR APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO MOST OF OUR STORES

IN THE U.S. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE SELL APPLIANCES

MANUFACTURED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC(R), MAYTAG(R) AND OTHER

MANUFACTURERS. WE DISPLAY AND STOCK THE MORE POPULAR

APPLIANCES IN OUR STORES AND OFFER THE ABILITY TO SPECIAL

ORDER OVER 2,000 ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPUTER KIOSKS

LOCATED IN THE STORE. THROUGH THE COMPUTER KIOSKS WE CAN

CHECK INVENTORY AND ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER

DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS SOON AS 48 HOURS AFTER THE

ORDER IS PLACED. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE

APPLIANCES WE SELL AND TO CONTINUE TO TEST NEW FORMATS FOR

SELLING APPLIANCES.

-        TOOL RENTAL. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO SATISFY A BROAD RANGE

OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS AND OUR D-I-Y

CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER A TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN CERTAIN STORES.

UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE RENT APPROXIMATELY 200

COMMERCIAL-QUALITY TOOLS IN TEN CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SAWS,

FLOOR SANDERS, GENERATORS, GAS POWERED LAWN EQUIPMENT AND

PLUMBING TOOLS. CUSTOMERS CAN LEASE THE TOOLS ON AN HOURLY,

DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS. OUR ASSOCIATES WHO WORK IN

THE TOOL RENTAL AREA RECEIVE SPECIAL TRAINING CONCERNING THE

USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TOOLS. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, WE

OFFERED TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN APPROXIMATELY 342 STORES

COMPARED TO 150 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 1999. DURING

FISCAL 2001, WE ANTICIPATE EXPANDING TOOL RENTAL SERVICES

INTO ADDITIONAL STORES, AND WE BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY TOOL

RENTAL CENTERS WILL BE IN APPROXIMATELY 60% OF OUR STORES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OFFERING THIS SERVICE INCREASES THE SALES OF

RELATED MERCHANDISE WITHOUT REDUCING THE SALES OF EQUIPMENT

SIMILAR TO THAT AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL.

-        SPECIAL ORDER CENTER TEST. CURRENTLY, THE SPECIAL ORDER

CENTER PROCESSES WATER HEATER ORDERS NATIONWIDE THROUGH A

TOLL-FREE NUMBER AND SPECIAL ORDER BLINDS AND WALLPAPER

THROUGH A SEPARATE TOLL-FREE NUMBER THAT IS AVAILABLE TO

APPROXIMATELY 95 STORES IN THREE MARKETS. STORES CURRENTLY

PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED WATER

HEATER SALES AND REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION TIMES FOR

PLACING ORDERS FOR BLINDS AND WALLPAPER.

-        CUSTOMER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE OFFER SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO

ENHANCE THE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS. OUR

ASSOCIATES AND VENDORS TEACH "HOW-TO" CLINICS THAT FOCUS ON

D-I-Y PROJECTS, SUCH AS INSTALLING GARBAGE DISPOSALS, LAYING

PATIO PAVERS OR BUILDING A DECK. IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICS,

WE OFFER HOME DEPOT UNIVERSITY(SM), WHICH PRESENTS FOUR-WEEK

MODULES ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEVERAL FACETS

OF A HOME IMPROVEMENT TOPIC. FOR EXAMPLE, A ROOM ENHANCEMENT

MODULE MAY PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON PAINT, WALLPAPER AND WINDOW

TREATMENTS. THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT'S KIDS WORKSHOP(SM)

PROGRAM, CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN TOOL SAFETY AND COMPLETE A

SMALL PROJECT, SUCH AS BUILDING A BIRDHOUSE OR TOOL BOX. WE

BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCREASE OUR

SALES BY ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE MORE PROJECTS,

DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OUR COMPETITION AND REINFORCING OUR

POSITION AS EXPERTS IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

STORE GROWTH

UNITED STATES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000, WE WERE OPERATING 1,029 HOME DEPOT

STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. DURING FISCAL 2000 IN THE

U.S., WE OPENED 173 NEW HOME DEPOT STORES AND RELOCATED EIGHT EXISTING HOME

DEPOT STORES. ALTHOUGH THESE NEW STORE OPENINGS OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN EXISTING

MARKETS, WE CONTINUED OUR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION BY OPENING STORES IN A NUMBER OF

NEW MARKETS. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE OPENING APPROXIMATELY 200 NEW STORES AND

RELOCATING NINE EXISTING STORES DURING FISCAL 2001.

TO INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND ENHANCE

LONG-TERM MARKET PENETRATION, WE OFTEN OPEN NEW STORES NEAR THE EDGE OF THE

MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES. WHILE THESE OPENINGS MAY INITIALLY HAVE

A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMPARABLE STORE-FOR-STORE SALES, WE BELIEVE THIS

"CANNIBALIZATION" STRATEGY INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND OVERALL MARKET

SHARE BY REDUCING DELAYS IN SHOPPING, INCREASING UTILIZATION BY EXISTING

CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS TO MORE CONVENIENT LOCATIONS. DURING

FISCAL 2000, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR STORES WERE CANNIBALIZED BY NEW STORE

OPENINGS.

CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000, WE WERE OPERATING 67 HOME DEPOT STORES IN

SEVEN CANADIAN PROVINCES. OF THESE STORES, 14 WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2000,

INCLUDING OUR FIRST STORES IN QUEBEC AND NOVA SCOTIA. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE

PLAN TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 13 ADDITIONAL STORES IN CANADA. OUR CANADIAN STORES

ARE OPERATED THROUGH A WHOLLY OWNED CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY OF THE HOME DEPOT.

SOUTH AMERICA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000, WE WERE OPERATING SEVEN HOME DEPOT

STORES IN CHILE AND ARGENTINA, AND WE ANTICIPATE OPENING ADDITIONAL STORES IN

SOUTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2001. WE OPERATE OUR CHILEAN HOME DEPOT STORES

THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE WITH S.A.C.I. FALABELLA, A LEADING DEPARTMENT STORE

RETAILER IN CHILE. OUR CONTROLLING SHARE OF THE JOINT VENTURE IS 66.67%.

5

OUR ARGENTINA STORES ARE OPERATED THROUGH A WHOLLY OWNED ARGENTINE SUBSIDIARY.

WE HAVE OFFICES IN BOTH ARGENTINA AND CHILE FROM WHICH DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS

ARE HANDLED BY A MANAGEMENT TEAM COMPRISED OF LOCAL NATIONALS AND SEASONED U.S.

HOME DEPOT MANAGERS.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY FOR OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IS

TO OFFER COMPLETE INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICES, HIGH-QUALITY, COMPETITIVELY PRICED

PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION SERVICES TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS IN THEIR HOME DECOR

AND REMODELING PROJECTS. EACH EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORE FEATURES UP TO EIGHT

DIFFERENT SHOWROOMS, EACH WITH FULL-SIZE DISPLAYS TO HELP CUSTOMERS VISUALIZE

THE END RESULT OF POSSIBLE INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECTS. TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS,

WE EMPLOY ASSOCIATES WHO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WHO HAVE

EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING, PLANNING AND COMPLETING PROJECTS.

CUSTOMERS. TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE MIDDLE TO

UPPER INCOME B-I-Y CUSTOMERS, WHO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE FOR INSTALLATION BY

OTHERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE OFFER INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE PRODUCTS WE

SELL AT THESE STORES.

PRODUCTS. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS AND

INSTALLATION SERVICES IN THE FOLLOWING CORE PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

-        KITCHENS

-        BATHS

-        DECOR

-        LIGHTING

-        FLOORING

-        APPLIANCES

-        PATIO

-        WINDOW TREATMENTS

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF MERCHANDISE IN AN EFFORT TO

MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF SHOPPERS WHOSE INTERIOR DESIGN PREFERENCES MAY GO BEYOND

THE ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A HOME DEPOT STORE. WHILE THERE IS MINIMAL OVERLAP

BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER

STORES, THOSE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE TYPICALLY

HIGHER-END OR MORE UNIQUE ITEMS. IN ADDITION TO NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND

NAME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO OFFER ITEMS THAT MUST BE SPECIAL ORDERED OR THAT ARE

TYPICALLY OFFERED THROUGH SHOWROOMS OPEN ONLY TO DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.

STORE GROWTH. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000, WE WERE OPERATING 26 EXPO DESIGN

CENTER STORES, ELEVEN OF WHICH WERE OPENED THAT YEAR. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE

OPENING 17 ADDITIONAL STORES IN FISCAL 2001. THESE NEW STORES ARE EXPECTED TO

AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 SQUARE FEET AND WILL INCORPORATE A SHOWROOM

ENVIRONMENT.

IN-STORE SERVICES. WE HAVE ASSOCIATES AT OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES TO

ASSIST WITH EVERY PHASE OF A PROJECT. CERTIFIED KITCHEN AND BATH DESIGNERS ARE

ON STAFF. WE ALSO HAVE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS DESIGN

LIGHTING, TILE AND FLOORING, CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY AND BEDDING, CUSTOM CLOSETS AND

WINDOW TREATMENTS. INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR MOST

6

9

PRODUCTS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, INCLUDING KITCHENS, BATHS, FLOORING,

WALLPAPER, TILE, LIGHTING FIXTURES AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. OUR PROJECT MANAGERS

ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN SCHEDULE LICENSED THIRD PARTY

CONTRACTORS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. WE WARRANT THE WORKMANSHIP OF EACH

INSTALLATION FOR AS LONG AS THE CUSTOMER OWNS THE HOME.

GEORGIA LIGHTING

WE ACQUIRED OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY GEORGIA LIGHTING IN JUNE 1999. GEORGIA

LIGHTING IS A LEADING SPECIALTY LIGHTING DESIGNER, DISTRIBUTOR AND RETAILER

BASED IN ATLANTA. THE COMPANY, WHICH HAS SIX RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFERS AN

EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF DECORATIVE LIGHTING FIXTURES, SUPPLIES, ACCENTS AND

ACCESSORIES TO COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACQUISITION

OF GEORGIA LIGHTING HAS ALLOWED US TO STRENGTHEN OUR SOURCING, TRAINING AND

MERCHANDISING IN LIGHTING FOR BOTH THE HOME DEPOT AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER

STORES.

APEX SUPPLY COMPANY

IN JANUARY 2000, WE ACQUIRED APEX SUPPLY COMPANY, A WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR OF

PLUMBING, HVAC, APPLIANCES AND OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY OFFERS THESE

PRODUCTS THROUGH 22 LOCATIONS IN GEORGIA, TENNESSEE AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND

EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 570 ASSOCIATES. APEX ASSISTED US WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF

OUR HVAC PROGRAM, AND WE BELIEVE THIS ACQUISITION WILL HELP US TO INCREASE OUR

PENETRATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL PLUMBING TRADES AND TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE

SPECIAL ORDERS FOR PLUMBING PRODUCTS MORE EFFICIENTLY IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

VILLAGER'S HARDWARE STORES

DURING FISCAL 1999, WE OPENED THE FIRST TWO VILLAGER'S HARDWARE TEST STORES,

AND IN FISCAL 2000 WE OPENED AN ADDITIONAL TWO STORES, ALL OF WHICH ARE IN NEW

COLOR AND SIZE, INCLUDING HARDWARE, FASTENERS, TOOLS, PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL AND

SEASONAL, AS WELL AS A BROAD SELECTION OF HOME ENHANCEMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

PAINT AND WALLPAPER, WINDOW TREATMENTS, LIGHTING, STORAGE, HOUSEWARES AND

GIFTWARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRIMARY FOCUS FOR THESE STORES WILL BE HOME

ENHANCEMENT AND SMALL PROJECTS. EACH VILLAGER'S HARDWARE STORE HAS

APPROXIMATELY 35,000 TO 40,000 SQUARE FEET OF SELLING SPACE IN A RETAIL

ENVIRONMENT, EMPHASIZING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EDUCATION. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE

WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST.

THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE

DURING FISCAL 2000, WE OPENED A TEST STORE IN PLANO, TEXAS THAT OFFERS FLOORING

PRODUCTS. THE FLOOR STORE'S MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT INCLUDES CARPET, CERAMIC,

WOOD, LAMINATE AND VINYL FLOORING. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE WILL CONTINUE TO

ANALYZE THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST.

INTERNET

OUR WEBSITE IS LOCATED AT WWW.HOMEDEPOT.COM. THE SITE OFFERS INFORMATION ABOUT

PROJECTS AND OUR PRODUCTS, CALCULATORS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF

MATERIALS NEEDED TO COMPLETE A PROJECT, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

COMPANY. AS WITH OUR STORES, THE FOCUS OF OUR WEBSITE IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE

BELIEVE OUR INTERNET SITE PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

7

10

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS, IMPROVE SERVICE AND

INCREASE INCREMENTAL STORE SALES.

DURING FISCAL 2000, WE BEGAN SELLING HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS OVER THE INTERNET IN

THREE MARKETS. WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT STORES IN THEIR

LOCAL MARKET ON OUR WEBSITE, AND THE PRODUCTS ARE PRICED BASED ON THE MARKET IN

WHICH THE CUSTOMER LIVES. ORDERS ARE FULFILLED FROM OUR STORES, AND CUSTOMERS

CAN EITHER PICK UP THEIR PURCHASES OR HAVE THEM DELIVERED. BY INTEGRATING

INTERNET PURCHASES WITH OUR STORES, WE HOPE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH

GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND SERVICE. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER

PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE SHIPPED BY UNITED PARCEL SERVICE FOR SALE THROUGH THE

INTERNET IN ADDITIONAL AREAS OF THE U.S.

DIRECT MARKETING SALES

WE HAVE TWO SUBSIDIARIES THAT SELL MERCHANDISE THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING.

MANAGEMENT MARKET. THROUGH ITS CATALOG, WHICH IS PUBLISHED

SEMI-ANNUALLY, MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE OFFERS APPROXIMATELY 16,000

ITEMS, INCLUDING VARIATIONS IN COLOR AND SIZE. MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSE,

WHICH EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 1,100 PEOPLE, EMPHASIZES ACCURATE ORDER

TAKING, DELIVERY AND PERSONALIZED SERVICE. ORDERS ARE TYPICALLY PLACED

OVER THE TELEPHONE, THROUGH A FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVE OR THROUGH

THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AT WWW.MWH.COM, ARE FILLED THROUGH ONE OF

MAINTENANCE WAREHOUSES' 19 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND ARE SHIPPED FOR

SAME-DAY OR NEXT-DAY DELIVERY. DURING FISCAL 2000, MAINTENANCE

WAREHOUSE EXPANDED ITS OPERATIONS IN TEXAS, ARKANSAS AND GEORGIA

THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF N-E THING SUPPLY COMPANY, INC.

-        NATIONAL BLINDS & WALLPAPER. NATIONAL BLINDS AND WALLPAPER SELLS DECOR

PRODUCTS THROUGH TELEPHONE SALES AND OVER THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY

MARKETS PRIMARILY THROUGH MAGAZINE ADVERTISING AIMED AT CUSTOMERS

SEEKING THE LOWEST PRICES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NO INVENTORY, BUT

RATHER ACTS AS A BROKER TO FILL SPECIAL ORDER SALES.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. EACH HOME DEPOT, EXPO DESIGN CENTER AND VILLAGER'S

HARDWARE STORE IS EQUIPPED WITH A COMPUTERIZED POINT OF SALE SYSTEM, ELECTRONIC

BAR CODE SCANNING SYSTEM AND A UNIX SERVER. STORE INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED

TO THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER'S COMPUTERS VIA A LAND-BASED ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER

MODE ("ATM") NETWORK IN THE U.S. AND A FRAME RELAY NETWORK INTERNATIONALLY.

THESE COMPUTERS PROVIDE CORPORATE, FINANCIAL, MERCHANDISING AND OTHER BACK

OFFICE FUNCTION SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE OUR SYSTEMS PROVIDE EFFICIENT CUSTOMER

CHECK-OUT AND RETURNS, STORE-BASED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, RAPID ORDER

REPLENISHMENT, LABOR PLANNING SUPPORT AND ITEM MOVEMENT INFORMATION. FAST

REGISTERS, CREDIT AUTHORIZATIONS AND CHECK APPROVALS EXPEDITE TRANSACTIONS IN

OUR STORES AT A PACE THAT WE BELIEVE SETS THE STANDARD FOR OUR INDUSTRY. FOR

EXAMPLE, TO BETTER SERVE THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS APPLYING FOR CREDIT

WHILE IN OUR STORES, THE CHARGE CARD APPROVAL PROCESS TIME HAS BEEN REDUCED TO

LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A MOBILE ORDERING SYSTEM IN OUR HOME DEPOT STORES USING

PORTABLE CARTS WITH

8

11

COMPUTERS TO ASSIST OUR ASSOCIATES IN PLACING ACCURATE ORDERS FOR INVENTORY.

THROUGH THE SYSTEM, AN ASSOCIATE ON THE SALES FLOOR CAN SEE THE SUPPLY THE

STORE HAS FOR A GIVEN ITEM, REVIEW THE SUGGESTED RE-ORDER QUANTITIES BASED ON

THE STORE'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PLACE AN ORDER WITH THE VENDOR. WE

BELIEVE THE SYSTEM INCREASES THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR ASSOCIATES

BECAUSE IT REQUIRES LESS TIME AND FEWER PEOPLE TO ASSESS AND ORDER INVENTORY.

WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A MOBILE SIGNING SYSTEM TO HELP ENSURE THAT OUR

SIGNING IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR POINT-OF-SALE PRICE DATA. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE

IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLING OUT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS TOOLS TO ASSIST WITH LABOR

SCHEDULING TO HELP ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS.

WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING AND UPGRADING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT

GROWTH, REDUCE AND CONTROL COSTS AND ENABLE OUR ASSOCIATES TO MAKE BETTER

DECISIONS. WE CONTINUE TO REALIZE GREATER EFFICIENCY AS A RESULT OF OUR

ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE ("EDI") PROGRAM. CURRENTLY, MOST OF OUR HIGH VOLUME

VENDORS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE EDI PROGRAM, WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN 70% OF

OUR TOTAL TRANSACTIONAL VOLUME. EDI IS A PAPERLESS SYSTEM, WHICH PROCESSES

ORDERS FROM BUYING OFFICES TO VENDORS, ALERTS THE STORES WHEN THE MERCHANDISE

IS TO ARRIVE AND TRANSMITS INVOICE DATA FROM THE VENDORS AND FREIGHT CARRIERS

TO THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER.

ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY

227,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 12,800 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE

REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 74% OF OUR ASSOCIATES

ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL,

WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS EQUAL TO OR ABOVE THOSE OF OUR

COMPETITORS IN EACH MARKET AREA. STORE MANAGERS HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION

REGARDING COMPETITIVE SALARY RATES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

WE DEVELOP OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF

OUR ASSOCIATES. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE

OF MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MANDATORY PRODUCT

KNOWLEDGE TRAINING CLASSES, AND TO EDUCATE, DEVELOP AND TEST THE SKILLS OF

THOSE ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BEING PROMOTED. BECAUSE OUR POLICY IS TO

PROMOTE OR RELOCATE CURRENT ASSOCIATES TO SERVE AS MANAGERS AND ASSISTANT

MANAGERS FOR NEW STORES, TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATES IS ESSENTIAL

TO OUR GROWTH. OUR DISTRICT MANAGERS AND STORE MANAGERS TYPICALLY MEET WITH OUR

HUMAN RESOURCES ASSOCIATES TO DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND

CERTAIN DEPARTMENT HEADS AND CONSIDER POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION.

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS IN OUR STORES TO ENSURE THAT WE HIRE AND PROMOTE

THE BEST QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAY. THESE PROGRAMS

INTEGRATE VALIDATED COMPUTERIZED TESTS FOR ALL APPLICANTS, AS WELL AS

SPECIALIZED TESTS FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS. IF AN APPLICANT PASSES THE COMPUTER

TEST, HE OR SHE MAY BE SELECTED FOR A STRUCTURED INTERVIEW IN WHICH QUESTIONS

TO BE ASKED ARE SELECTED BY THE COMPUTER BASED ON THE ANSWERS GIVEN ON THE

ORIGINAL COMPUTER TEST. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A LIST OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHO ARE

INTERESTED IN A NEW ASSIGNMENT AND OF QUALIFIED OUTSIDE APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE

REVIEWED WHEN POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.

WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A STRIKE OR ANY WORK STOPPAGE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE GOOD. THERE ARE NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

COVERING ANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES.

MARKETING. WE ARE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAIL ADVERTISERS, AND WE

UTILIZE ALL FORMS OF MASS MEDIA AND SELECTED FORMS OF HIGHLY TARGETED MEDIA. WE

ALSO INCORPORATE MAJOR SPONSORSHIPS INTO OUR MARKETING PLAN, SUCH AS NASCAR(R),

THE OLYMPIC GAMES, CBS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND HOME AND GARDEN SHOWS. WE EXTEND

OUR REACH AND EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROPRIETARY PUBLICATIONS,

9

12

SUCH AS THE HOME IMPROVEMENT 1-2-3(TM) SERIES AND THE STYLE IDEAS MAGAZINE.

WE EXECUTE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON BOTH A NATIONAL AND LOCAL BASIS. BECAUSE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STORES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA, WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN SMALLER RETAILERS BY USING

NATIONAL ADVERTISING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE TAILOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR

ADVERTISING LOCALLY TO RESPOND TO MARKET DIFFERENCES, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTS

AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

CREDIT SERVICES. HOME DEPOT OFFERS CREDIT PURCHASE PROGRAMS TO BOTH

PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y AND B-I-Y CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2000, 2.6 MILLION NEW

HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOME DEPOT

ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO ALMOST 8 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 19% OF ALL HOME DEPOT SALES IN FISCAL 2000. DURING FISCAL

2000, WE ROLLED-OUT A PROGRAM TO ALL U.S. STORES THAT GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS THE

OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR UNSECURED HOME IMPROVEMENT LOANS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LOAN PROGRAM NOT ONLY

INCREASES LARGE SALES, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATH REMODELS, BUT ALSO GENERATES

INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE

HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION OF A VARIETY OF TRADE NAMES,

SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE

HOME DEPOT(R), THE "HOMER" (R) CHARACTER, EXPO DESIGN CENTER(R) STORES, HAMPTON

BAY(R) FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES AND PREMIUMCUT(TM) LUMBER. WE REGARD OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT

FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF THE COMPANY AND OUR STORES AND DIRECT MARKETING

EFFORTS. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR OUR GLOBALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT WE DIRECTLY

IMPORT, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM,

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR BOTH VENDOR/FACTORY AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE,

WHICH MEASURE FACTORS INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY, TIMELY SHIPMENTS AND FILL

RATE. THE PERFORMANCE RECORD IS MONITORED RELATIVE TO OUR REQUIREMENTS AND IS

ALSO MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT.

THIS QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH IS APPLIED TO PRODUCTS DIRECTLY IMPORTED

BY HOME DEPOT, HAS FOUR COMPONENTS.

-        WE AUTHORIZE LABORATORIES TO TEST PRODUCTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS;

-        WE DEVELOP AND DOCUMENT PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS, BASED ON TEST

RESULTS, APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND

FEATURES DETERMINED BY OUR MERCHANTS;

-        WE ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF FACTORIES TO MANUFACTURE QUALITY

PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AS

WELL AS TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HOME DEPOT POLICIES

ON CHILD LABOR; AND

-        WE ROUTINELY ASSESS PRODUCT QUALITY AND FACTORY PERFORMANCE

BY CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY ON SHIPMENTS TO

ASSURE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS,

AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO PERFORM RANDOM AUDITS ON CHILD

LABOR POLICIES.

10

13

LOGISTICS. WE USE SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASE

OUR EFFICIENCIES. A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS SHIPPED DIRECTLY

FROM OUR VENDORS TO THE STORES. WE OPERATE A NUMBER OF FACILITIES TO DISTRIBUTE

THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE TO OUR STORES. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN IMPORT PRODUCTS

REQUIRE THE USE OF DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE SEVEN IMPORT

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, ARGENTINA AND

CHILE. ADDITIONALLY, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000, WE HAD 27 LUMBER DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO SUPPORT THE LUMBER DEMANDS OF OUR

STORES. WE ALSO OPERATED ONE CROSS-DOCKING TRANSIT FACILITY, AND WE CURRENTLY

PLAN TO ADD SEVERAL ADDITIONAL FACILITIES DURING FISCAL 2001. AT THESE

FACILITIES, WE RECEIVE MERCHANDISE FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IMMEDIATELY LOAD IT

ONTO TRUCKS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO

IMPROVE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO BETTER SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR STORES AND

TO LOWER COSTS.

SAFETY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

AND ASSOCIATES. THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT CONSISTS OF A TEAM OF DIRECTORS AND

MANAGERS IN THE FIELD FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS

AN ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED SAFETY RESOURCES WHO EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT

POLICIES AND PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE. THE GOAL OF THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS TO

IMPLEMENT A SAFETY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENGINEER SAFETY INTO THE FABRIC OF OUR

COMPANY, ESTABLISHING A "SAFETY FIRST" APPROACH TO ALL FACETS OF OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE COMPANY'S SAFETY PROGRAM,

WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STORE-LEVEL ASSOCIATES, STORE AND

DIVISION MANAGEMENT, AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS. THE

PRIMARY FOCUSES OF OUR SAFETY PROGRAM ARE (1) TO ESTABLISH SAFETY STANDARDS AND

PROCESSES FOR ALL ASPECTS OF STORE OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, (2) TO

EFFECTIVELY TRAIN APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATES ON ALL APPLICABLE STANDARDS, AND (3)

TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED SAFETY STANDARDS.

COMPETITION. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE

LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE

SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL,

PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO

SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND

NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT

BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO

THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY

DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN

PROFESSIONALS.

DUE TO THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE

OUR MARKET SHARE IN EXISTING MARKET AREAS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AN EFFECTIVE

AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITOR IN OUR MARKETS. BASED ON U.S. CENSUS DATA ESTIMATES,

INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND DATA PROVIDED BY THE HOME IMPROVEMENT RESEARCH

INSTITUTE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKET SHARE IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, CURRENTLY

DEFINED AS INCLUDING THE DO-IT-YOURSELF/BUY-IT-YOURSELF, TRADESMEN,

BUILDERS/GENERAL CONTRACTORS, HEAVY INDUSTRIAL, REPAIR AND REMODELING AND

PROPERTY MAINTENANCE MARKETS, IS APPROXIMATELY 9.4%.

RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE OWNED. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

LEASE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES, WE GENERALLY PREFER TO OWN STORES BECAUSE OF

GREATER OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY, GENERALLY LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES.

OUR EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY

1,665,000 SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. IN

ADDITION, AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, WE OCCUPIED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY

1,368,000 SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 305,000 SQUARE FEET IS OWNED AND

APPROXIMATELY 1,063,000 SQUARE FEET IS LEASED, FOR DIVISIONAL STORE SUPPORT

CENTERS AND SUBSIDIARY CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTERS. THESE SUPPORT CENTERS ARE

LOCATED IN ORANGE AND SAN LEANDRO, CALIFORNIA; TAMPA, FLORIDA; ATLANTA,

GEORGIA; ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILLINOIS; CANTON, MASSACHUSETTS; PLYMOUTH,

MICHIGAN; SOUTH PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY; DALLAS, TEXAS; TUKWILA, WASHINGTON;

SCARBOROUGH, ONTARIO AND QUEBEC, CANADA; SANTIAGO, CHILE; AND BUENOS AIRES,

ARGENTINA.

AT JANUARY 28, 2001, WE UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY 8,277,000 SQUARE FEET OF

WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION SPACE, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 620,000 IS OWNED AND

APPROXIMATELY 7,657,000 IS LEASED.

WE BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF EXISTING LEASE TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE

CAN BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE SPACE FOR LEASE OR PURCHASE THAT

IS READILY AVAILABLE.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE COMPANY'S

PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD

BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2001 COMPARED TO JANUARY 30, 2000

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2000 INCREASED 19.0% TO $45.7 BILLION FROM $38.4 BILLION

IN FISCAL 1999. THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FULL

YEAR SALES FROM THE 169 NEW STORES OPENED DURING FISCAL 1999, A 4% COMPARABLE

STORE-FOR-STORE SALES INCREASE AND 204 NEW STORE OPENINGS.

GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 29.9% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO 29.7%

FOR FISCAL 1999. THE RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER COST

OF MERCHANDISE RESULTING FROM PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS, BENEFITS FROM GLOBAL

SOURCING PROGRAMS AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TOOL RENTAL CENTERS FROM 150

AT THE END OF FISCAL 1999 TO 342 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000.

18

21

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 20.7% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO

19.8% FOR FISCAL 1999. SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

SALES INCREASED TO 18.6% IN FISCAL 2000 FROM 17.8% IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER STORE SELLING PAYROLL EXPENSES RESULTING

FROM MARKET WAGE PRESSURES AND AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE LONGEVITY. IN ADDITION,

MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER FAMILY ENROLLMENT IN THE COMPANY'S

MEDICAL PLANS, RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND HIGHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS.

FINALLY, STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES, PROPERTY RENT,

DEPRECIATION AND UTILITIES, INCREASED DUE TO NEW STORE GROWTH AND ENERGY RATE

INCREASES.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 0.3% FOR BOTH FISCAL 2000 AND

1999. THE COMPANY OPENED 204 NEW STORES AND RELOCATED 8 STORES IN FISCAL 2000,

COMPARED TO OPENING 169 NEW STORES AND RELOCATING 6 STORES IN FISCAL 1999.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AVERAGED $671,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO

$643,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 1999. THE HIGHER AVERAGE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO THE OPENING OF MORE EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AND EXPANSION OF HOME DEPOT

STORES INTO CERTAIN NEW MARKETS INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS, WHICH

INVOLVED LONGER PRE-OPENING PERIODS AND HIGHER TRAINING, TRAVEL AND RELOCATION

COSTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 1.8% FOR FISCAL

2000 COMPARED TO 1.7% FOR FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS A

FULL YEAR OF PAYROLL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING FOUR NEW

DIVISIONAL OFFICES, WHICH OPENED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH FISCAL

2000 AND 1999. INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH

COMPARABLE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY'S COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED TO

38.8% FOR FISCAL 2000 FROM 39.0% FOR FISCAL 1999. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO HIGHER TAX CREDITS IN FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999.

NET EARNINGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 5.6% FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO 6.0%

FOR FISCAL 1999, REFLECTING HIGHER SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A

PERCENT OF SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER GROSS PROFIT RATE AS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $1.10 FOR FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO $1.00

FOR FISCAL 1999.

FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 30, 2000 COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 1999

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 1999 INCREASED 27.2% TO $38.4 BILLION FROM $30.2 BILLION

IN FISCAL 1998. THIS INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FULL

YEAR SALES FROM THE 138 NEW STORES OPENED DURING FISCAL 1998, A 10% COMPARABLE

STORE-FOR-STORE SALES INCREASE, AND 169 NEW STORE OPENINGS AND 6 STORE

RELOCATIONS DURING FISCAL 1999.

GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 29.7% FOR FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO 28.5%

FOR FISCAL 1998. THE RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER COST

OF MERCHANDISE RESULTING FROM PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS AND INCREASED SALES OF

IMPORTED PRODUCTS, AND OTHER MERCHANDISING INITIATIVES BEGUN IN PRIOR YEARS AND

CONTINUED DURING FISCAL 1999, AS WELL AS TO SALES MIX SHIFTS TO HIGHER GROSS

MARGIN PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND ASSORTMENTS. IN ADDITION, INVENTORY AND REFUND

19

22

SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE EFFECTIVE TRAINING RESULTED IN BETTER INVENTORY

SHRINK RESULTS AND LOWER PRODUCT MARKDOWNS.

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 19.8% FOR FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO

19.7% FOR FISCAL 1998. SELLING AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

SALES INCREASED TO 17.8% IN FISCAL 1999 FROM 17.7% IN FISCAL 1998. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER STORE SELLING PAYROLL EXPENSES RESULTING

FROM MARKET WAGE PRESSURES AND AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE LONGEVITY, AS WELL AS BY

THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVES. IN

ADDITION, MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER FAMILY ENROLLMENT IN THE

COMPANY'S MEDICAL PLANS, INCREASED CLAIMS AND HIGHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS.

THE COMPANY'S STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING FISCAL 1999 ALSO RESULTED IN

HIGHER BONUS EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES. CREDIT CARD DISCOUNTS INCREASED AS

A RESULT OF HIGHER PENETRATIONS OF CREDIT CARD SALES AND INCREASES IN

NON-PRIVATE LABEL DISCOUNT RATES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE

LOWER NET ADVERTISING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM HIGHER COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

PARTICIPATION BY VENDORS AND ECONOMIES REALIZED FROM THE INCREASED USE OF

NATIONAL ADVERTISING.

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 0.3% FOR BOTH FISCAL 1999 AND

1998. THE COMPANY OPENED 169 NEW STORES AND RELOCATED 6 STORES IN FISCAL 1999,

COMPARED TO 138 NEW STORES AND 4 STORE RELOCATIONS IN FISCAL 1998. PRE-OPENING

EXPENSES AVERAGED $643,000 PER STORE IN FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO $618,000 PER

STORE IN FISCAL 1998. THE HIGHER AVERAGE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

OPENING OF MORE EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AND EXPANSION OF HOME DEPOT STORES

INTO CERTAIN NEW MARKETS, WHICH INVOLVED LONGER PRE-OPENING PERIODS AND HIGHER

TRAINING, TRAVEL AND RELOCATION COSTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 1.7% FOR BOTH

FISCAL 1999 AND 1998. INCREMENTAL EXPENSES RELATED TO LONG-TERM GROWTH AND

BUSINESS PLANNING INITIATIVES, INCLUDING INTERNET DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS AND THE OPENING OF FOUR NEW DIVISIONAL OFFICES DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999, WERE OFFSET BY EFFICIENCIES REALIZED FROM INCREASED

SALES.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH FISCAL

1999 AND 1998. INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS 0.1% FOR BOTH

COMPARABLE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY'S COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED TO

39.0% FOR FISCAL 1999 FROM 39.2% FOR FISCAL 1998. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO HIGHER TAX CREDITS IN FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998.

NET EARNINGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE 6.0% FOR FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO 5.3%

FOR FISCAL 1998, REFLECTING A HIGHER GROSS PROFIT RATE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $1.00 FOR FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO $0.71 FOR FISCAL

1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM STORE OPERATIONS PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH A

SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S

INVENTORY IS FINANCED UNDER VENDOR CREDIT TERMS.

20

23

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY PLANS TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 200 NEW STORES AND RELOCATE 9

EXISTING STORES DURING FISCAL 2001. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 92% OF

THESE LOCATIONS WILL BE OWNED, AND THE REMAINDER WILL BE LEASED.

THE COMPANY HAS TWO OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS TOTALING $882 MILLION FOR THE

PURPOSE OF FINANCING CONSTRUCTION COSTS OF CERTAIN NEW STORES. UNDER THE

OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE LESSOR PURCHASES THE PROPERTIES, PAYS FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY LEASES THE FACILITIES TO THE COMPANY. THE

LEASES PROVIDE FOR SUBSTANTIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES AND INCLUDE PURCHASE

OPTIONS AT ORIGINAL COST ON EACH PROPERTY. THE COMPANY FINANCED A PORTION OF

ITS NEW STORES OPENED FROM FISCAL 1997 THROUGH FISCAL 2000, AS WELL AS OFFICE

BUILDINGS IN FISCAL 1999 AND 2000, UNDER THE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE COST OF NEW STORES TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND OWNED BY THE COMPANY VARIES

WIDELY, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LAND COSTS, AND IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO AVERAGE

APPROXIMATELY $14.1 MILLION PER LOCATION. THE COST TO REMODEL AND/OR FIXTURE

STORES TO BE LEASED IS EXPECTED TO AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION PER

STORE. IN ADDITION, EACH NEW STORE WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $3.5 MILLION TO

FINANCE INVENTORIES, NET OF VENDOR FINANCING.

DURING FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 6 1/2% SENIOR NOTES

("SENIOR NOTES"). THE SENIOR NOTES ARE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2004 AND PAY

INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE SENIOR NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY AT ANY

TIME, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT A DEFINED REDEMPTION PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST

UP TO THE REDEMPTION DATE. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE USED TO

FINANCE A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM, INCLUDING STORE

EXPANSIONS AND RENOVATIONS, FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS BORROWINGS UP TO A

MAXIMUM OF $1 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, THERE WERE $754 MILLION OF

BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY HAS A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR UP TO $800

MILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2004, CONTAINS VARIOUS

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD $167 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT CASH POSITION, INTERNALLY

GENERATED FUNDS, FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS $1 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATE SOURCES OF FINANCING SHOULD ENABLE THE

COMPANY TO COMPLETE ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STORE OPENINGS

AND RENOVATIONS, THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE PRECISE EFFECT OF

INFLATION ON ITS OPERATIONS, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES." SFAS 133 REQUIRES ALL DERIVATIVES TO BE

CARRIED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVES MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS WHEN

THEY OCCUR; HOWEVER, THERE IS AN EXCEPTION FOR DERIVATIVES THAT QUALIFY AS

HEDGES AS DEFINED BY SFAS 133. IF A DERIVATIVE QUALIFIES AS A HEDGE, A COMPANY

CAN ELECT TO USE "HEDGE ACCOUNTING" TO ELIMINATE OR REDUCE THE INCOME STATEMENT

VOLATILITY THAT WOULD ARISE FROM REPORTING CHANGES IN A DERIVATIVE'S FAIR

VALUE. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS 133 IN THE QUARTER ENDING APRIL 29, 2001 AND

WILL RECORD ITS DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE. BASED ON THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS AT JANUARY 28, 2001, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") ISSUED STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101 ("SAB 101"), "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS." SAB 101 SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC STAFF'S VIEWS IN APPLYING

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2001, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH SAB 101.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE

CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE MAKE IN THIS REPORT, AND OTHER WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS

MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY, MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. WORDS OR PHRASES

SUCH AS "SHOULD RESULT," "ARE EXPECTED TO," "WE ANTICIPATE," "WE ESTIMATE," "WE

PROJECT," "WE BELIEVE," OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE

DESCRIPTIONS OF OUR PLANS WITH RESPECT TO NEW STORE OPENINGS AND RELOCATIONS,

OUR PLANS TO ENTER NEW MARKETS AND EXPECTATIONS RELATING TO OUR CONTINUING

GROWTH. THESE STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT

COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND ITS PRESENT EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE; HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD NOT

PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON SUCH STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE

DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE

ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF FUTURE EVENTS, NEW

INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE EXPECTED RESULTS DESCRIBED IN THE

COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

-        ADVERSE OR UNANTICIPATED WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL LEVEL OF SALES AND SALES OF PARTICULAR LINES OF

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BUILDING MATERIALS, LUMBER AND LAWN AND GARDEN

SUPPLIES.

-        INSTABILITY OF COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF SOURCING CHANNELS, WHICH MAY

AFFECT THE PRICES THAT THE COMPANY PAYS FOR CERTAIN COMMODITY

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS LUMBER AND PLYWOOD, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY

TO IMPROVE ITS MIX OF MERCHANDISE. OUR COST OF SALES IS AFFECTED BY

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH

OUR SUPPLIERS. OUR SOURCES OF SUPPLY MAY BE AFFECTED BY TRADE

RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT COSTS AND

CAPACITY, AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

22

25

-        OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES

TO STAFF BOTH EXISTING AND NEW STORES.

-        CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE AVAILABILITY, ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND

OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING LOCAL ZONING AND LAND USE ISSUES,

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL

REAL ESTATE MARKET.

-        GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH AFFECT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT AND HOME-BUILDING SPENDING, INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, THE

OVERALL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER

CREDIT AND MORTGAGE FINANCING AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES.

-        THE IMPACT OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMERS,

LOCATIONS AND PRODUCTS AND IN OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.

OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING

MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES, LUMBER YARDS, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES AND

OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL OR NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, AS WELL AS DISCOUNT

DEPARTMENT STORES AND ANY OTHER CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION THAT OFFERS

PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY

FACE NEW TYPES OF COMPETITORS AS WE ENTER NEW MARKETS OR LINES OF

BUSINESS.

-        CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, TAX STATUTES OR REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE

REGULATIONS, AND UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT VARIOUS TIMES TO MANAGE THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE

CONTRACTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS (SUCH AS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS), INTEREST RATE RISK AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL.
