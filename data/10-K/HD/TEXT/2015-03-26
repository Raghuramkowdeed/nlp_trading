DATA BREACH

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL

2014

, WE CONFIRMED THAT OUR PAYMENT DATA SYSTEMS WERE BREACHED, WHICH IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WHO USED PAYMENT CARDS AT OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES (THE "DATA BREACH"). FOR A DESCRIPTION OF MATTERS RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH, SEE ITEM 7, "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS."

OUR BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A CONSISTENT STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK COMPRISED OF THREE KEY INITIATIVES – CUSTOMER SERVICE; PRODUCT AUTHORITY; AND DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY – TIED TOGETHER THROUGH OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL INITIATIVE. IN FISCAL

2014

, WE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITY TO DELIVER A SUPERIOR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. AS CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO BUY HOW, WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT, WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A SEAMLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS, FEATURING INNOVATIVE AND EXPANDED PRODUCT CHOICES, WILL BE A KEY ENABLER FOR FUTURE SUCCESS. BECOMING A BEST-IN-CLASS INTERCONNECTED RETAILER IS GROWING IN IMPORTANCE AS THE LINE BETWEEN ONLINE AND IN-STORE SHOPPING CONTINUES TO BLUR. OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL INITIATIVE SUPPORTS AND CONNECTS THE THREE OTHER KEY INITIATIVES OF OUR LONG-STANDING STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK, WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN OUR STORES AND OUR ONLINE CHANNELS AND OUR CONNECTIVITY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EFFORTS ARE WOVEN THROUGH EACH OF OUR OTHER THREE INITIATIVES, EACH OF WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE, WE STRENGTHENED CONNECTIVITY IN FISCAL

2014

BY ROLLING OUT THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE FIRST PHONE, A HANDHELD MOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL USED BY OUR STORE ASSOCIATES. UNDER OUR PRODUCT AUTHORITY INITIATIVE, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR WEBSITE AND MOBILE SITES, WHICH SERVE AS AN EXTENDED AISLE OF PRODUCTS, PRODUCT INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE ON PROJECTS AND SERVICES. UNDER OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVE, WE CONTINUED TO OPTIMIZE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITIES TO BUILD CONNECTIVITY AMONG OUR DELIVERY CHANNELS. IN FISCAL

2014

, WE STARTED A PILOT FOR BUY ONLINE, DELIVER FROM STORE ("BODFS"), WHICH COMPLEMENTS OUR EXISTING INTERCONNECTED RETAIL PROGRAMS: BUY ONLINE, PICK-UP IN STORE ("BOPIS"), BUY ONLINE, SHIP TO STORE ("BOSS") AND BUY ONLINE, RETURN IN STORE ("BORIS").

CUSTOMER SERVICE

OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS, CREATING AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR LONG-STANDING GOAL HAS BEEN TO REMOVE COMPLEXITY FROM THE STORES TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO FOCUS ON OUR CUSTOMERS, AND IN FISCAL

2014

WE CONTINUED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY STORE REPORTS, STORE-BASED EMAILS AND MEETINGS THAT TOOK AWAY FROM THE TIME STORE ASSOCIATES COULD SPEND ON SELLING ACTIVITIES.

OUR CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS, AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT CUSTOMER SERVICE APPROACHES TO MEET THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS.

•

DO-IT-YOURSELF ("DIY") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. OUR ASSOCIATES ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS WITH SPECIFIC PRODUCT AND INSTALLATION QUESTIONS BOTH IN OUR STORES AND THROUGH ONLINE RESOURCES AND OTHER MEDIA DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PRODUCT AND PROJECT KNOWLEDGE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF CLINICS AND WORKSHOPS BOTH TO IMPART THIS KNOWLEDGE AND TO BUILD AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR DIY CUSTOMERS.

•

DO-IT-FOR-ME ("DIFM") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT OR INSTALLATION. OUR STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION SERVICES TARGETED AT DIFM CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS FROM US IN OUR STORES, ONLINE OR IN THEIR HOMES THROUGH IN-HOME CONSULTATIONS. OUR INSTALLATION PROGRAMS INCLUDE MANY CATEGORIES, SUCH AS FLOORING, CABINETS, COUNTERTOPS, WATER HEATERS, AND SHEDS. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION IN A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES SOLD THROUGH OUR IN-HOME SALES PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ROOFING, SIDING, WINDOWS, KITCHEN AND BATH REFACING, FURNACES, AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS.

•

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS

. THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND TRADESMEN. WE RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE SERVICE NEEDS OF THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER AND USE OUR EXPERTISE TO FACILITATE THEIR BUYING EXPERIENCE. WE OFFER A VARIETY OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, DESIGNATED PARKING SPACES CLOSE TO STORE ENTRANCES AND BULK PRICING PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ONLINE AND IN-STORE PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOYALTY PROGRAM, PRO XTRA, THAT PROVIDES OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS WITH DISCOUNTS ON USEFUL BUSINESS SERVICES, EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT OFFERS AND A PURCHASE TRACKING TOOL TO ENABLE RECEIPT LOOKUP ONLINE AND JOB TRACKING OF PURCHASES ACROSS ALL FORMS OF PAYMENT. THIS PROGRAM, INTRODUCED IN FISCAL 2013, CONTINUED TO GAIN TRACTION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION CUSTOMERS ENROLLED BY THE END OF FISCAL

2014.

WE HELP OUR DIY, DIFM AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS FINANCE THEIR PROJECTS BY OFFERING PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT PRODUCTS IN OUR STORES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS. IN FISCAL

2014

, OUR CUSTOMERS OPENED APPROXIMATELY 2.9 MILLION NEW THE HOME DEPOT PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT ACCOUNTS, AND AT FISCAL YEAR END THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION. PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 23% OF SALES IN FISCAL

2014.

BUILDING CONNECTIVITY

. IN FISCAL

2014

, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS' INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCES THROUGH A VARIETY OF INITIATIVES. AS NOTED ABOVE, WE COMPLETED THE FIRST MAJOR UPGRADE OF OUR FIRST PHONE IN-STORE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. OUR NEW WEB-ENABLED HANDHELD DEVICES, WHICH ALLOW MOBILE CHECKOUT, GIVE OUR ASSOCIATES A SIMPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL FOR LOCATING PRODUCTS, CHECKING INVENTORY ON HAND OR SIMPLY EXPLAINING PRODUCT FEATURES. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR "INTERCONNECTED" CUSTOMERS. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS RESEARCH PRODUCTS ONLINE AND THEN GO INTO ONE OF OUR STORES TO VIEW THE PRODUCTS IN PERSON OR TALK TO AN ASSOCIATE BEFORE MAKING THE PURCHASE. WHILE IN THE STORE, CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO GO ONLINE TO ACCESS RATINGS AND REVIEWS, COMPARE PRICES OR VIEW OUR EXTENDED ASSORTMENT. OUR WEB-ENABLED FIRST PHONES HELP OUR ASSOCIATES ASSIST WITH THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER CUSTOMERS IN THE AISLES. APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR ONLINE ORDERS WERE CREATED FROM INSIDE OUR STORES IN FISCAL

2014

. DURING FISCAL

2014

, WE ALSO INTRODUCED A NEW MOBILE APP THAT PROVIDES AN ENHANCED IN-STORE MAP AND LIVE CHAT FEATURE, AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE USING THIS MOBILE APP INSIDE OUR STORES.

WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT CUSTOMERS DESIRE GREATER VISIBILITY, CONTROL AND OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO RECEIVING THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION TO OUR BOPIS, BOSS, AND BODFS PROGRAMS, DURING FISCAL

2014

WE DEVELOPED SEVERAL DELIVERY ENHANCEMENTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE BEGAN PILOT PROGRAMS TO OFFER TIME-SPECIFIC DELIVERY OF ORDERS PLACED ONLINE OR IN THE STORES; IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE FOR SCHEDULING A DELIVERY; AND ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO SELF-SCHEDULE A DELIVERY ON OUR WEBSITE. TIME-SPECIFIC DELIVERY CAPABILITY WILL BE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WHO NEED TO ENSURE THEIR ORDERS ARE DELIVERED TO THEIR JOB SITES AT THE TIME THAT ALIGNS WITH THE PROJECT PLAN TO AVOID DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS.

WE ALSO MADE ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR SPECIAL ORDER AND INSTALLATION PROCESS IN FISCAL

2014

. FIRST, WE INTRODUCED OUR NEW CUSTOMER ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WHICH IS BEING ROLLED OUT TO ALL U.S. STORES. THIS SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE GREATER VISIBILITY INTO AND IMPROVED EXECUTION OF SPECIAL ORDERS BY OUR ASSOCIATES AND A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO REPLACED OUR LEAD AND PURCHASE ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH A SINGLE PLATFORM FOR OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. IN ADDITION TO THE NEW INTERFACE, INSTALLERS HAVE THE OPTION TO INTEGRATE DIRECTLY WITH OUR SYSTEM THROUGH A SECURE DATA TRANSMISSION. THIS SYSTEM IMPROVES COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN INSTALLERS AND THE STORES AND DELIVERS A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO BUILT BETTER CONNECTIVITY TO REDUCE THE TIME BETWEEN A CUSTOMER'S INITIAL INQUIRY FOR SERVICE AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER'S CONTACT WITH THE CUSTOMER, WHICH MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE CUSTOMER WILL PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT.

OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ASSOCIATES ARE KEY TO OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE. WE EMPOWER OUR ASSOCIATES TO DELIVER EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER FIRST TRAINING PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES ENHANCED TRAINING FOR OUR INTERCONNECTED CUSTOMERS THAT STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF QUICK PICKUP OF MERCHANDISE. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TO RECOGNIZE STORES AND INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER AND COMMUNITY SERVICE. AT THE END OF FISCAL

2014

, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 371,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 23,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE. WE MEASURE ASSOCIATE SATISFACTION REGULARLY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE VERY GOOD.

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

OUR PRODUCT AUTHORITY INITIATIVE IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PRODUCT INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. IN FISCAL

2014

, WE CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS TO OUR PROFESSIONAL, DIFM AND DIY CUSTOMERS, WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON OFFERING EVERYDAY VALUES IN OUR STORES AND ONLINE.

PRODUCTS DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING BOTH NATIONAL BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY ITEMS. TO ENHANCE OUR MERCHANDISING CAPABILITIES, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TOOLS IN FISCAL

2014

TO GIVE OUR MERCHANTS AND SUPPLIERS GREATER VISIBILITY INTO CATEGORY AND ITEM PERFORMANCE AND TO BETTER ASSORT PRODUCTS WITHIN STORES WITH SIMILAR ATTRIBUTES BASED ON LOCAL PREFERENCES, REGULATIONS AND DEMOGRAPHICS. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO USE THE RESOURCES OF BLACKLOCUS, INC., A DATA ANALYTICS AND PRICING FIRM WE ACQUIRED IN FISCAL 2012, TO HELP US MAKE FOCUSED MERCHANDISING DECISIONS BASED ON LARGE, COMPLEX DATA SETS. WE ALSO USE THESE ANALYTICS AT A STORE-LEVEL TO AUTOMATE AND OPTIMIZE OUR MARKDOWN AND CLEARANCE PROCESS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, OUR ONLINE PROPERTIES COMPLEMENT OUR STORES BY SERVING AS AN EXTENDED AISLE, AND WE OFFER A SIGNIFICANTLY BROADER PRODUCT ASSORTMENT THROUGH OUR HOME DEPOT, HOME DECORATORS COLLECTION AND BLINDS.COM WEBSITES. FOR OUR ONLINE USER EXPERIENCE, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR WEBSITES AND MOBILE SITES BY IMPROVING NAVIGATION AND SEARCH FUNCTIONALITIES TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO MORE EASILY FIND AND PURCHASE AN EXPANDED ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE FOR THEIR PURCHASES, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH OUR BOPIS, BOSS AND BODFS PROGRAMS AND OTHER DELIVERY ENHANCEMENTS INTRODUCED IN FISCAL 2014. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS, WE INCREASED TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES, ONLINE SALES CONVERSION RATES, AND THE NUMBER OF ORDERS BEING PICKED UP IN OUR STORES. FOR FISCAL

2014

, WE HAD OVER 1.2 BILLION VISITS TO OUR ONLINE PROPERTIES; SALES FROM OUR ONLINE CHANNELS INCREASED OVER 36% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013; AND ALMOST 40% OF OUR ONLINE ORDERS WERE PICKED UP IN A STORE, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 30% IN FISCAL 2013.

ENERGY SAVING PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS.

THE HOME DEPOT HAS A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY, AS DO MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, AND WE BELIEVE OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CREATING VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS.

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION.

OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION BASED PRIMARILY ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY THE WORLD’S LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER, IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES, AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH INSTALLERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE FACE GROWING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE AND MULTICHANNEL RETAILERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE THAN OURS, AS OUR CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY USE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES TO SHOP ONLINE AND COMPARE PRICES AND PRODUCTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

OUR BUSINESS HAS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED BRANDS IN NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE HOME DEPOT

®

TRADEMARK HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS, E-COMMERCE, STORES AND BUSINESS.

2014

, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK AND IMPROVING OUR INVENTORY, TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTIVITY.

LOGISTICS.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON CREATING A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH ENSURING PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVELY USING OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY, AND MANAGING TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. OUR FISCAL

2014

INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE AND EFFICIENTLY OPERATE OUR NETWORK, BUILD NEW LOGISTICS CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVE OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES BY INVESTING IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL FLOW PATH FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT. RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS ("RDCS") PLAY A KEY ROLE IN OPTIMIZING OUR NETWORK AS THEY ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF PRODUCT NEEDS FOR MULTIPLE STORES TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON ARRIVAL AT THE RDC. THIS RESULTS IN A SIMPLIFIED ORDERING PROCESS AND IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE 18 MECHANIZED RDCS IN THE U.S., AND WE OPENED OUR FIRST RDC IN CANADA IN EARLY

2014

, WITH A SECOND CANADIAN RDC SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2015. WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR U.S. TRANSLOAD PROGRAM FOR IMPORTED PRODUCTS IN FOUR FACILITIES OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES NEAR OCEAN PORTS. TRANSLOAD FACILITIES ALLOW US TO IMPROVE OUR IMPORT LOGISTICS COSTS AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT BY POSTPONING FINAL INVENTORY DEPLOYMENT DECISIONS UNTIL PRODUCT ARRIVES AT DESTINATION PORTS.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE CENTRALIZED OUR INVENTORY PLANNING AND REPLENISHMENT FUNCTION AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED OUR FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS HAS HELPED US TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVENTORY PRODUCTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME. AT THE END OF FISCAL

2014

, OVER 95% OF OUR U.S. STORE PRODUCTS WERE ORDERED THROUGH CENTRAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

IN ADDITION TO OUR RDCS AND TRANSLOAD FACILITIES, AT THE END OF FISCAL

2014

, WE OPERATED 34 BULK DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHICH HANDLE PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED OPTIMALLY ON FLAT BED TRUCKS, IN THE U.S. AND CANADA; 21 STOCKING DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO; AND TEN SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHICH INCLUDE OFFSHORE CONSOLIDATION AND RETURN LOGISTICS CENTERS, IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO LEVERAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITIES TO FULLY UTILIZE AND OPTIMIZE OUR IMPROVED LOGISTICS NETWORK. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEGUN TO FLOW A PORTION OF OUR BOSS ORDERS THROUGH OUR RDCS, WHICH REDUCES OUR TRANSPORTATION COSTS FOR THOSE ORDERS.

BUILDING CONNECTIVITY.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT USING OUR ALMOST 2,000 U.S. STORES AS A NETWORK OF CONVENIENT LOCATIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHO SHOP ONLINE AND USE OUR BOPIS, BOSS AND BORIS PROGRAMS PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. AS NOTED ABOVE, IN FISCAL

2014

, WE STARTED A PILOT FOR BODFS, WHICH WILL GIVE US THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER ORDERS PLACED ONLINE FROM OUR STORES TO THE CUSTOMER'S HOME OR JOB SITE. IN ADDITION, WE ADDED CAPACITY FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL ONLINE DIRECT-TO-CUSTOMER DELIVERY METHODS IN FISCAL

2014

. WE OPENED TWO NEW DIRECT FULFILLMENT CENTERS IN GEORGIA AND CALIFORNIA, WHICH BRINGS OUR TOTAL TO FOUR DIRECT FULFILLMENT CENTER OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., AND ANOTHER FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2015. THESE FACILITIES WILL SUPPORT OUR ONLINE GROWTH WITH A BALANCE OF COST EFFICIENCY AND SPEED IN SHIPPING ONLINE ORDERS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. WE EXPECT THESE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE US THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER 90% OF OUR CUSTOMERS' PARCEL ORDERS IN THE U.S. WITHIN TWO DAYS.

COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS

. THE HOME DEPOT IS COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING ENERGY USAGE, SUPPLY CHAIN, STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, AND, AS NOTED ABOVE UNDER "ENERGY SAVING PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS," PRODUCT SELECTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

IN FISCAL

2014

, OUR ENERGY MANAGEMENT TEAM CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT STRICT OPERATIONAL STANDARDS THAT ESTABLISH ENERGY EFFICIENT PRACTICES IN ALL OF OUR U.S. FACILITIES. THESE INCLUDE HVAC UNIT TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND ADHERENCE TO STRICT LIGHTING SCHEDULES, WHICH ARE THE LARGEST SOURCES OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR STORES, AS WELL AS USE OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN EACH STORE TO MONITOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING AND UTILIZING THESE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS, WE HAVE SAVED OVER 8.6 BILLION KILOWATT HOURS (KWH) SINCE 2004. WE SET A GOAL TO REDUCE OUR KWH PER SQUARE FOOT IN OUR U.S. STORES BY 20% BY 2015. WE MET THAT GOAL IN FISCAL 2013, WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR TARGETED DATE, AND ESTIMATE A REDUCTION OF ALMOST 32% AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2014.

THROUGH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "LOGISTICS," WE TARGETED A 20% REDUCTION IN OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM 2008 TO 2015. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO MONITOR OUR "CARBON FOOTPRINT" FROM THE OPERATION OF OUR STORES AS WELL AS FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY CHAIN ACTIVITIES. THROUGH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND ENERGY REDUCTION INITIATIVES, WE HAVE EXCEEDED OUR GOAL BY REDUCING OUR ABSOLUTE CARBON EMISSIONS BY OVER 1.9 MILLION METRIC TONS FROM 2008 TO 2013, INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF OVER 125,000 METRIC TONS IN 2013.

AT OUR STORES, WE IMPLEMENTED A RAINWATER RECLAMATION PROJECT IN 2010. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2014

, WE HAD RETROFITTED 150 OF OUR STORES WITH RECLAMATION TANKS TO COLLECT RAINWATER AND CONDENSATION FROM HVAC UNITS AND GARDEN CENTER ROOFS, WHICH IS IN TURN USED TO WATER PLANTS IN OUR OUTSIDE GARDEN CENTERS. WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL WATER SAVINGS FROM THESE UNITS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 500,000 GALLONS PER RETROFITTED STORE IN FISCAL

2014.

OUR EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2014, WE RECEIVED THREE SIGNIFICANT AWARDS FROM THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ("EPA"). WE WERE NAMED "RETAIL PARTNER OF THE YEAR" BY BOTH THE ENERGY STAR

®

DIVISION AND WATERSENSE

®

DIVISION OF THE EPA FOR OUR OVERALL EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WATER EFFICIENCY, AND WE RECEIVED THE EPA'S "SMARTWAY EXCELLENCE AWARD," WHICH RECOGNIZES THE HOME DEPOT AS AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN FREIGHT SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE CDP (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT) REPORTING PROCESS. CDP IS AN INDEPENDENT, INTERNATIONAL, NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION PROVIDING A GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR COMPANIES AND CITIES TO MEASURE, DISCLOSE, MANAGE AND SHARE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION. IN 2014, WE SCORED 93 OUT OF 100 FROM THE CDP FOR OUR DISCLOSURE, PLACING US AMONG THE HIGHEST SCORING RETAILERS AND IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF OUR SECTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED A PERFORMANCE BAND RANKING OF A- (OUT OF A RANGE FROM A TO E), REFLECTING A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, ADAPTATION AND TRANSPARENCY.

WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE SHOPPING AND WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY ("EH&S") FUNCTION IS DEDICATED TO ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES, WITH TRAINED ASSOCIATES WHO EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS. OUR EH&S POLICIES ARE WOVEN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTO OUR EVERYDAY OPERATIONS AND ARE PART OF THE HOME DEPOT CULTURE. SOME COMMON PROGRAM ELEMENTS INCLUDE: DAILY STORE INSPECTION CHECKLISTS (BY DEPARTMENT); ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP AUDITS FROM OUR STORE-BASED SAFETY TEAM MEMBERS AND REGIONAL, DISTRICT AND STORE OPERATIONS FIELD TEAMS; EQUIPMENT ENHANCEMENTS AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL SAFETY; DEPARTMENTAL MERCHANDISING SAFETY STANDARDS; TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR ALL ASSOCIATES, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF TRAINING PROVIDED BASED ON AN ASSOCIATE'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES; AND AWARENESS, COMMUNICATION AND RECOGNITION PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO DRIVE OPERATIONAL AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF EH&S ISSUES.

RETURNING VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS

. IN ADDITION TO MAKING DISCIPLINED DECISIONS ABOUT CAPITAL ALLOCATION, WE MAINTAINED OUR FOCUS ON EXPENSE CONTROL, WHICH DROVE HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ALLOWED US TO RETURN VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH $7.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES AND $2.5 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS IN FISCAL 2014, AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7, "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH INSTALLERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE FACE GROWING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE AND MULTICHANNEL RETAILERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE THAN OURS, AS OUR CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY USE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES TO SHOP ONLINE AND COMPARE PRICES AND PRODUCTS IN REAL TIME. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS OR OUR INABILITY TO ADAPT EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY TO A CHANGING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, OUR MARGINS OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, OUR MARKET SHARE AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, OUR REPUTATION, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS; CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS; AND UNEXPECTED WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHILE ALSO MANAGING APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND MAINTAINING HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. AS THE HOUSING AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET CONTINUES TO RECOVER, RESULTING CHANGES IN DEMAND WILL PUT FURTHER PRESSURE ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS AND MAINTAIN HIGH SERVICE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, EACH OF OUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS – DIY, DIFM AND PROFESSIONALS – HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY DIFFERENTIATE THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF A CUSTOMER GROUP, WE MAY LOSE MARKET SHARE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE CUSTOMERS.

CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE METHODS BY WHICH THEY PURCHASE AND RECEIVE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE ALSO EVOLVING. CUSTOMERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING TECHNOLOGY AND MOBILE DEVICES TO RAPIDLY COMPARE PRODUCTS AND PRICES AND TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS. ONCE PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED, CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING ALTERNATE OPTIONS FOR DELIVERY OF THOSE PRODUCTS. WE MUST CONTINUALLY ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PURCHASING PROCESS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS LIKE BOSS AND BOPIS, AND ARE PILOTING BODFS, BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE PROGRAMS OR OTHERS WE MAY IMPLEMENT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY OR WILL MEET CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. CUSTOMERS ARE ALSO USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT CAN BE QUICKLY AND BROADLY DISSEMINATED. TO THE EXTENT A CUSTOMER HAS A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE AND SHARES IT OVER SOCIAL MEDIA, IT MAY IMPACT OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FURTHER, WE HAVE AN AGING STORE BASE THAT REQUIRES MAINTENANCE AND SPACE REALLOCATION INITIATIVES TO DELIVER THE SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT THAT OUR CUSTOMERS DESIRE. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR STORES AND UTILIZE OUR STORE SPACE EFFECTIVELY, TO PROVIDE A COMPELLING ONLINE PRESENCE, TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS AND TO DIFFERENTIATE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, OUR REPUTATION, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING LABOR RELATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE, OR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF JOB SATISFACTION. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS, PARTICULARLY IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES INCREASE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

WE DISCOVERED A DATA BREACH IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 AND ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE FULL EXTENT OF ITS IMPACT AND THE IMPACT OF RELATED GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND CIVIL LITIGATION ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

OUR RECENT DATA BREACH INVOLVED THE THEFT OF CERTAIN PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION AND CUSTOMER EMAIL ADDRESSES THROUGH UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF THE DATA BREACH, WE ARE FACING AT LEAST 57 CIVIL LAWSUITS FILED IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND OTHER CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS, PAYMENT CARD BRANDS, PAYMENT CARD ISSUING BANKS, SHAREHOLDERS, OR OTHERS SEEKING DAMAGES OR OTHER RELATED RELIEF, ALLEGEDLY ARISING OUT OF THE DATA BREACH. WE ARE ALSO FACING INVESTIGATIONS BY A NUMBER OF STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. OUR FINANCIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THESE CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, ONE OF WHICH IS WHETHER, AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH, THE PORTION OF OUR NETWORK THAT HANDLES PAYMENT CARD DATA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY STANDARDS. ANOTHER FACTOR IS WHETHER, AND IF SO TO WHAT EXTENT, ANY FRAUD LOSSES OR OTHER EXPENSES EXPERIENCED BY CARDHOLDERS, THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS OR THE CARD ISSUING BANKS ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNTS AFFECTED BY THE DATA BREACH CAN BE PROPERLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE DATA BREACH AND WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THOSE LOSSES AND EXPENSES WOULD IN ANY EVENT BE OUR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY.

THESE CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT HOW WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND FINES. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES INVESTIGATING THE DATA BREACH MAY SEEK TO IMPOSE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR DATA SECURITY COSTS, ADVERSELY IMPACT HOW WE OPERATE OUR SYSTEMS AND COLLECT AND USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE WITH OTHER RETAILERS.

INVESTIGATIONS OF THE DATA BREACH ARE ONGOING, AND WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER IMPACTS OF THE DATA BREACH. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WAS ACCESSED OR STOLEN, OR OTHER UNFORESEEN DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH COULD OCCUR, WHICH COULD HAVE A FURTHER ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION.

IF OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER OR COMPANY INFORMATION ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS, AND BECOME SUBJECT TO FURTHER LITIGATION, ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

OUR BUSINESS, LIKE THAT OF MOST RETAILERS, INVOLVES THE RECEIPT, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION, CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION, AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ASSOCIATES, OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR COMPANY, SOME OF WHICH IS ENTRUSTED TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS. WE ALSO WORK WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS THAT PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT WE USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECEIPT, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS, ARE VULNERABLE TO AN INCREASING THREAT OF CONTINUALLY EVOLVING CYBERSECURITY RISKS. UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THESE SYSTEMS OR OUR INFORMATION THROUGH FRAUD OR OTHER MEANS OF DECEIVING OUR ASSOCIATES, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR VENDORS. HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS WE DEVELOP OR OBTAIN FROM THIRD PARTIES MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OR OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD UNEXPECTEDLY COMPROMISE INFORMATION SECURITY. THE METHODS USED TO

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, DISABLE OR DEGRADE SERVICE, OR SABOTAGE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND EVOLVING, AND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE OR DETECT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND REGULARLY REVIEW AND UPDATE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF SECURED DATA AND TO PREVENT DATA LOSS. HOWEVER, THE EVER-EVOLVING THREATS MEAN WE AND OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS MUST CONTINUALLY EVALUATE AND ADAPT OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES OR MISUSES OF DATA. ANY FUTURE SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF OUR DATA SECURITY, WHETHER EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL, OR MISUSE OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER OR COMPANY DATA, COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, AS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA COLLECTION AND USE, AND PRIVACY BECOMES INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT-RELATED RISKS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS, EXPOSE US TO FRAUD OR THEFT, SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

WE ACCEPT PAYMENTS USING A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING CASH, CHECKS, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, PAYPAL, OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARDS AND INSTALLMENT LOAN PROGRAM, AND GIFT CARDS, AND WE MAY OFFER NEW PAYMENT OPTIONS OVER TIME. ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PAYMENT OPTIONS SUBJECTS US TO RULES, REGULATIONS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PAYMENT NETWORK RULES AND OPERATING GUIDELINES, DATA SECURITY STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, AND RULES GOVERNING ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME OR BE REINTERPRETED, MAKING COMPLIANCE MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY. THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY HAS SET OCTOBER 1, 2015 AS THE DATE ON WHICH IT WILL SHIFT LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS TO RETAILERS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT EMV CHIP CARD CREDIT AND DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT ALL FORMS OF EMV CARD TRANSACTIONS BY THE TARGET DATE, WE ARE RELIANT ON VARIOUS THIRD PARTIES TO ESTABLISH THE STANDARD FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS, DEVELOP AND TEST THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE, DEFINE THE APPLICABLE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS, AND CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE STANDARDS. THE FAILURE OF THESE THIRD PARTIES TO TIMELY COMPLETE AND DELIVER NEEDED ELEMENTS, OR OUR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY AND TIMELY IMPLEMENT THOSE ELEMENTS ONCE RECEIVED, WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT ALL TYPES OF EMV CARD TRANSACTIONS BY THE TARGET DATE, WHICH COULD IN TURN RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIABILITY SHIFT. FOR CERTAIN PAYMENT METHODS, INCLUDING CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, WE PAY INTERCHANGE AND OTHER FEES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OVER TIME AND RAISE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES, INCLUDING THE PROCESSING OF CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS, AND OTHER FORMS OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT. IF THESE COMPANIES BECOME UNABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO US, OR IF THEIR SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, IT COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS. THE PAYMENT METHODS THAT WE OFFER ALSO SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL FRAUD AND THEFT BY CRIMINALS, WHO ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE SOPHISTICATED, SEEKING TO OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES THAT MAY EXIST IN THE PAYMENT SYSTEMS, AS REFLECTED IN OUR RECENT DATA BREACH. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE RULES OR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PAYMENT METHODS WE ACCEPT, OR IF PAYMENT-RELATED DATA IS COMPROMISED DUE TO A BREACH OR MISUSE OF DATA, WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR COSTS INCURRED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUING BANKS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES OR SUBJECT TO FINES AND HIGHER TRANSACTION FEES, OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCEPT OR FACILITATE CERTAIN TYPES OF PAYMENTS MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN CERTAIN PAYMENT TYPES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SHIFT TO OTHER PAYMENT TYPES OR POTENTIAL CHANGES TO OUR PAYMENT SYSTEMS THAT MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CAUSING OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL – INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES; INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS; FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS; LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS; THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING; THE STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT; WEATHER; NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL – COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED OR PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS, MANAGE AND PROTECT TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF, SECURITY OF AND CONSISTENT ACCESS TO THIS DATA IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS. FOR THESE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST PERIODICALLY MAINTAIN AND UPDATE THEM. OUR SYSTEMS AND THE THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS WE RELY ON ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM A NUMBER OF CAUSES, INCLUDING POWER OUTAGES; COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPUTER VIRUSES; SECURITY BREACHES; CYBER-ATTACKS; CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES, TORNADOES, OR HURRICANES; ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM; AND DESIGN OR USAGE ERRORS BY OUR ASSOCIATES, CONTRACTORS OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. ALTHOUGH WE AND OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY AND TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE RISK OF COMPROMISE OF THE INTEGRITY, SECURITY AND CONSISTENT OPERATIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. AS A RESULT, WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE COSTLY, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL STRATEGY AND GIVE RISE TO NEGATIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES.

THROUGH OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND A MULTICHANNEL EXPERIENCE THAT EMPOWERS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AND INTERACT WITH US FROM COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES. WE USE OUR WEBSITE BOTH AS A SALES CHANNEL FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND ALSO AS A METHOD OF PROVIDING PRODUCT, PROJECT AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE BOTH IN-STORE AND ONLINE SALES. WE HAVE MULTIPLE ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND KNOWLEDGE CENTERS THAT ALLOW US TO INFORM, ASSIST AND INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. MULTICHANNEL RETAILING IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND EXPANDING, AND WE MUST EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS. DISRUPTIONS, FAILURES OR OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THESE CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR THE BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE TO OUR ONLINE AND IN-STORE BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, MILITARY CONFLICT, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS (PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF CONTINUING ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE WORLD), SUPPLIERS’ NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ANY DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLIERS’ LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORKS, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR OR OUR SUPPLIERS’ CONTROL.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION WITHIN OUR LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INVENTORY IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, INCREASED SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. SUCH DISRUPTIONS MAY RESULT FROM DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS; NATURAL DISASTERS; TRADE RESTRICTIONS; TARIFFS; THIRD-PARTY STRIKES, LOCK-OUTS, WORK STOPPAGES OR SLOWDOWNS; SHIPPING CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS; SUPPLY OR SHIPPING INTERRUPTIONS OR COSTS; OR OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BOTH BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO ALLOW US TO MARKET PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO NATIONAL BRANDS. OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OTHER RETAILERS, GENERALLY CARRY HIGHER MARGINS THAN NATIONAL BRAND PRODUCTS AND REPRESENT A GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR SALES AND GROSS MARGIN RESULTS.

OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN INCREASED RISKS.

AS WE EXPAND OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISKS DUE TO OUR GREATER ROLE IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MARKETING AND SALE OF THOSE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING GREATER RESPONSIBILITY TO ADMINISTER AND COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASED POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY AND PRODUCT RECALL EXPOSURE. TO EFFECTIVELY

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXECUTE ON OUR PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY, WE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE AND AVOID CLAIMS RELATED TO THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF OUR VENDORS' PRODUCTS, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR VENDORS. ANY FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS SOME OR ALL OF THESE RISKS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHILE SIMPLIFYING CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A MORE INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYING NEW WEB-BASED TOOLS AND SERVICES, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER, EACH OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICE BUSINESS, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES AND BE SUBJECT TO FINES, LAWSUITS AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR DIFM CUSTOMERS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY OR TO PROVIDE PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THESE SERVICES, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS, AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN, EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND REFORMS, AS WELL AS EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. CHANGES IN, EXPANDED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER WAGE, LABOR OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY, THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY, TAXES, ENERGY COSTS OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS OR IMPACT OUR STORE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, RECENT HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS AND OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS UNDER OUR BENEFIT PLANS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT RETAIL OPERATIONS IN, AND SOURCE PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS FROM, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME RISKS WE FACE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, POTENTIAL ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE, AND CHALLENGES IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLANS MAY ALSO EXERCISE STOCK OPTIONS BY SURRENDERING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT THE PARTICIPANTS ALREADY OWN AS PAYMENT OF THE EXERCISE PRICE. SHARES SO SURRENDERED BY PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLANS ARE REPURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLANS AND APPLICABLE AWARD AGREEMENT AND NOT PURSUANT TO PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $17.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE AT THE END OF FISCAL 2014. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $18.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. THIS NEW PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A PRESCRIBED EXPIRATION DATE.

IN MARCH 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE ("ASR") AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO REPURCHASE

$850 MILLION

OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. SHARES RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASR AGREEMENT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE SHARE REPURCHASE TABLE IN FUTURE QUARTERS.

2014.

DATA BREACH

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, WE CONFIRMED THAT OUR PAYMENT DATA SYSTEMS WERE BREACHED, WHICH POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WHO USED PAYMENT CARDS AT SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS IN OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES. OUR INVESTIGATION TO DATE HAS DETERMINED THE INTRUDER USED A VENDOR’S USER NAME AND PASSWORD TO ENTER THE PERIMETER OF OUR NETWORK. THE INTRUDER THEN ACQUIRED ELEVATED RIGHTS THAT ALLOWED IT TO NAVIGATE PORTIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS AND TO DEPLOY UNIQUE, CUSTOM-BUILT MALWARE ON OUR SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS TO ACCESS PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION OF UP TO 56 MILLION CUSTOMERS WHO SHOPPED AT OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES BETWEEN APRIL 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 2014. ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2014, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE MALWARE USED IN THE DATA BREACH HAD BEEN ELIMINATED FROM OUR SYSTEMS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT DEBIT PIN NUMBERS WERE COMPROMISED OR THAT THE DATA BREACH IMPACTED STORES IN MEXICO OR CUSTOMERS WHO SHOPPED ONLINE AT HOMEDEPOT.COM OR HOMEDEPOT.CA. IN ADDITION, WE ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 6, 2014 THAT SEPARATE FILES CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 53 MILLION EMAIL ADDRESSES WERE ALSO TAKEN DURING THE DATA BREACH. THESE FILES DID NOT CONTAIN PASSWORDS, PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION OR OTHER SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DATA BREACH IS ONGOING, AND WE ARE SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2014, WE COMPLETED A MAJOR PAYMENT SECURITY PROJECT THAT PROVIDES ENHANCED ENCRYPTION OF PAYMENT CARD DATA AT THE POINT OF SALE IN ALL OF OUR U.S. STORES, OFFERING SIGNIFICANT NEW PROTECTION FOR CUSTOMERS. THE NEW SECURITY PROTECTION TAKES RAW PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION AND SCRAMBLES IT TO MAKE IT UNREADABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED USERS. WE ARE ALSO ROLLING OUT ENHANCED ENCRYPTION TO OUR CANADIAN STORES AND EMV CHIP-AND-PIN TECHNOLOGY IN OUR U.S. STORES, WHICH WILL ADD EXTRA LAYERS OF PAYMENT CARD PROTECTION FOR CUSTOMERS WHO USE EMV ENABLED CHIP-AND-PIN CARDS. OUR CANADIAN STORES ARE ALREADY ENABLED WITH EMV CHIP-AND-PIN TECHNOLOGY.

EXPENSES INCURRED

IN FISCAL 2014, WE RECORDED

$63 MILLION

OF PRETAX EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$30 MILLION

OF EXPECTED INSURANCE PROCEEDS FOR COSTS WE BELIEVE ARE REIMBURSABLE AND PROBABLE OF RECOVERY UNDER OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, FOR PRETAX NET EXPENSES OF

$33 MILLION

. THESE EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2014. EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS TO INVESTIGATE THE DATA BREACH; PROVIDE IDENTITY PROTECTION SERVICES, INCLUDING CREDIT MONITORING, TO IMPACTED CUSTOMERS; INCREASE CALL CENTER STAFFING; AND PAY LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH WERE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE EXPENSES, WE BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS WILL MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST US. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THESE CLAIMS WILL LIKELY INCLUDE AMOUNTS FOR INCREMENTAL COUNTERFEIT FRAUD LOSSES AND NON-ORDINARY COURSE OPERATING EXPENSES (SUCH AS CARD REISSUANCE COSTS) THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS ASSERT THEY OR THEIR ISSUING BANKS HAVE INCURRED. IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DETERMINED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT (1) AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH THE PORTION OF OUR NETWORK THAT HANDLES PAYMENT CARD DATA WAS NONCOMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, AND (2) THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE CAUSED AT LEAST SOME PORTION OF THE COMPROMISE OF PAYMENT CARD DATA THAT OCCURRED DURING THE DATA BREACH. ALTHOUGH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ASSESSOR FOUND THE PORTION OF OUR NETWORK THAT HANDLES PAYMENT CARD DATA TO BE COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE DATA SECURITY STANDARDS IN THE FALL OF 2013, AND THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING SUCH CERTIFICATION FOR 2014 WAS ONGOING AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH, IN MARCH 2015 THE FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS ALLEGED THAT WE WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN OF THOSE STANDARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS WILL MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST US AND THAT WE WILL DISPUTE THOSE CLAIMS. WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARE ASSERTED, WE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE, BASED ON THE FACTS AND INFORMATION THEN AVAILABLE TO US, WHETHER TO LITIGATE OR SEEK TO SETTLE THOSE CLAIMS. AT THIS TIME, WE BELIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WILL ENSUE AND THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL INCUR A LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE CLAIMS. WE CANNOT

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF LOSSES BECAUSE NO CLAIMS HAVE YET BEEN ASSERTED AND BECAUSE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES KNOWN AND WILL RECORD AN ESTIMATE FOR LOSSES AT THE TIME OR TIMES WHEN IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT PAID ON PAYMENT CARD NETWORK CLAIMS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION, AT LEAST

57

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN COURTS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND OTHER CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS, PAYMENT CARD BRANDS, PAYMENT CARD ISSUING BANKS, SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHERS SEEKING DAMAGES OR OTHER RELATED RELIEF, ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE DATA BREACH. FURTHERMORE, SEVERAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, INCLUDING STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, ARE INVESTIGATING EVENTS RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH, INCLUDING HOW IT OCCURRED, ITS CONSEQUENCES AND OUR RESPONSES. WE ARE COOPERATING IN THE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS. WHILE A LOSS FROM THESE MATTERS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS, OR RANGE OF COSTS, RELATED TO THESE MATTERS BECAUSE THE PROCEEDINGS REMAIN IN THE EARLY STAGES, ALLEGED DAMAGES HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFIED, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CLASS OR CLASSES BEING CERTIFIED OR THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF ANY CLASS IF CERTIFIED, AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE NOT CONCLUDED THAT A LOSS FROM THESE MATTERS IS PROBABLE; THEREFORE, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED AN ACCRUAL FOR LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO THESE MATTERS IN FISCAL 2014. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES KNOWN AND WILL RECORD AN ESTIMATE FOR LOSSES AT THE TIME OR TIMES WHEN IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT PAID ON THESE ACTIONS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FUTURE COSTS

WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DATA BREACH IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE WILL RECOGNIZE THESE EXPENSES AS SERVICES ARE RECEIVED. COSTS RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN FUTURE PERIODS MAY ALSO INCLUDE LIABILITIES TO PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF CREDIT CARD FRAUD AND CARD REISSUANCE COSTS; LIABILITIES RELATED TO OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD FRAUD AND CARD REISSUANCE COSTS; LIABILITIES FROM CURRENT AND FUTURE CIVIL LITIGATION, GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS; FUTURE EXPENSES FOR LEGAL, INVESTIGATIVE AND CONSULTING FEES; AND INCREMENTAL EXPENSES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT PAID ON THESE SERVICES AND CLAIMS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INSURANCE COVERAGE

WE MAINTAINED

$100 MILLION

OF NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE IN FISCAL 2014, ABOVE A

$7.5 MILLION

DEDUCTIBLE, TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH. AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, WE HAD RECEIVED AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF

$10 MILLION

OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS. IN FISCAL 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW POLICY, WITH $100 MILLION OF NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE, ABOVE A $10 MILLION DEDUCTIBLE, TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SIMILAR LOSSES.

KEY INITIATIVES

IN FISCAL

2014

, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING KEY INITIATIVES.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

– OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS, CREATING AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH CUSTOMERS, PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES. IN FISCAL 2014, WE COMPLETED THE ROLLOUT OF OUR SECOND GENERATION FIRST PHONE, A HANDHELD MOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL USED BY OUR STORE ASSOCIATES. THE LATEST FIRST PHONE GENERATION PROVIDES A MORE INTUITIVE SMARTPHONE INTERFACE, INTERNET ACCESS TO CONVERT ONLINE SALES IN THE AISLE, INTEGRATED MOBILE CHECKOUT AND GREATLY IMPROVED OVERALL PROCESSING SPEED.

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

– OUR PRODUCT AUTHORITY INITIATIVE IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PRODUCT INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. IN FISCAL

2014

, WE CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS TO OUR PROFESSIONAL, DO-IT-FOR-ME AND DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON OFFERING EVERYDAY VALUES IN OUR STORES AND ONLINE. USING OUR NEW MERCHANDISING ASSORTMENT PLANNING AND PRICING TOOLS IN FISCAL 2014, WE REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN A TYPICAL STORE, ALLOWING US TO BETTER MATCH OUR ASSORTMENTS TO LOCAL CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATIONS AND DEMOGRAPHICS. WE ALSO USED THESE TOOLS TO HELP US MAKE OTHER FOCUSED MERCHANDISING DECISIONS, INCLUDING DECISIONS REGARDING OUR MARKDOWN AND CLEARANCE PROCESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

– OUR APPROACH TO DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY IS ADVANCED THROUGH CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE STORES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND BUILDING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND TOTAL VALUE RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF

80 MILLION

SHARES FOR

$7.0 BILLION

THROUGH ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE ("ASR") AGREEMENTS AND THE OPEN MARKET DURING FISCAL

2014

. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $18.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION, AND WE ANNOUNCED A 26% INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.59 PER SHARE.

IN JANUARY 2015, WE ACQUIRED HD SUPPLY HARDWARE SOLUTIONS, KNOWN AS CROWN BOLT, A LEADING SUPPLIER OF FASTENERS AND BUILDERS HARDWARE TO RETAILERS IN THE U.S. WE EXPECT THIS ACQUISITION TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN HARDWARE.

IN FISCAL

SIX

NEW STORES IN MEXICO, INCLUDING ONE RELOCATION, AND OPENED

ONE

NEW STORE IN CANADA, FOR A TOTAL STORE COUNT OF

AT THE END OF FISCAL

$2.0 BILLION

. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO

$2.0 BILLION

. IN DECEMBER 2014, WE REPLACED OUR BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN JULY 2017, WITH A NEW, SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL

$2.0 BILLION

CREDIT FACILITY. THE NEW CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2019 AND CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS, AND THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT FEBRUARY 1, 2015, THERE WERE

$290 MILLION

OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND

NO

BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. SEE NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND RELATED CREDIT FACILITY.

WE USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY, INC. ON AUGUST 30, 2007, WE GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED AMORTIZING TERM LOAN OF HD SUPPLY, INC. THE ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE OF THE GUARANTEE WAS AUGUST 30, 2012. IN MARCH 2010, WE AMENDED THE GUARANTEE TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE TO APRIL 1, 2014. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AT AUGUST 30, 2007 WAS $16 MILLION AND WAS RECORDED AS A LIABILITY IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THE EXTENSION OF THE GUARANTEE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE TO $67 MILLION, RESULTING IN A $51 MILLION CHARGE TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2010. IN APRIL 2012, THE TERM LOAN GUARANTEE WAS TERMINATED. AS A RESULT, WE REVERSED THE $67 MILLION LIABILITY RELATED TO THE GUARANTEE, RESULTING IN A $67 MILLION PRETAX BENEFIT TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2012.

AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, WE HAD

$1.7 BILLION

IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, OBLIGATIONS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE DATA BREACH AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.

IN MARCH 2015, WE ENTERED INTO AN ASR AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO REPURCHASE

$850 MILLION

OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE PAID

$850 MILLION

TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND RECEIVED AN INITIAL DELIVERY OF APPROXIMATELY

7 MILLION

SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015. THE FINAL NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT WILL BE DETERMINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER THE TERM OF THE ASR AGREEMENT.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OPERATING LEASES FOR A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE USED, AT TIMES, TO MANAGE OUR FIXED/FLOATING RATE DEBT PORTFOLIO. AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AND 10% WAS FLOATING-RATE DEBT. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE INTEREST COSTS OF FLOATING-RATE DEBT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $16.2 BILLION

OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THESE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

WAS APPROXIMATELY $19.0 BILLION.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND ON THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THESE FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES. REVENUES FROM THESE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $8.5 BILLION OF OUR REVENUE IN BOTH FISCAL 2014 AND 2013. OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUES

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY

74%

VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE US, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2014

OR

2013.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

SELF-INSURANCE

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY), WORKERS’ COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL AND AUTOMOBILE CLAIMS FOR WHICH WE ARE SELF-INSURED. OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION OR DEDUCTIBLE, AS APPLICABLE, FOR EACH CLAIM INVOLVING GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO $25 MILLION, $1 MILLION AND $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY STOP LOSS LIMITS FOR SELF-INSURED EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITIES REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED AND ARE ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES. THE LIABILITIES ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012

. WE MAINTAIN NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF OUR DATA SECURITY. THIS COVERAGE IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 13 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS’ PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS’ PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET COMPETITION AND INFLATION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE STORES WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS OF OWNED LOCATIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SUBLEASE INCOME AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE FOR LEASED LOCATIONS. A 10% DECREASE IN ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME AND A 10% INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS FOR THE CHINA STORE CLOSINGS IN FISCAL 2012, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL BUT DO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. EACH YEAR WE MAY ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS, WITH A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT COMPLETED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. OUR MOST RECENT QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2013.

IN FISCAL 2014, WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL FOR OUR U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO REPORTING UNITS. WE PERFORMED QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS, CONCLUDING THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN FISCAL 2012, WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $97 MILLION TO IMPAIR ALL OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FORMER CHINA REPORTING UNIT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR REMAINING GOODWILL FOR FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO

TEN

YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2014-09, "REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)" ("ASU NO. 2014-09"), WHICH REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH IT EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. ASU NO. 2014-09 SUPERSEDES MOST EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN U.S. GAAP. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD, AND EARLY APPLICATION IS NOT PERMITTED. THE GUIDANCE PERMITS THE USE OF EITHER THE RETROSPECTIVE OR CUMULATIVE EFFECT TRANSITION METHOD. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU NO. 2014-09 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY. BOTH THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE "EXCHANGE ACT"). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF

THREE

MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY’S CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE COMPANY’S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE RELATED RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER EXPIRES IN

2018

, WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS’ USE OF THE CARDS AND ANY PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A"). THE SUM OF THE THREE IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY AS "THE COST OF CREDIT" OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $68 MILLION

AND $57 MILLION

AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

AND

FEBRUARY 2, 2014

, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY’S VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2014

OR

2013.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS IN CANADA AND MEXICO, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

26%

OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2014

OR

2013.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF THOSE POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED. RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX POSITIONS ARE MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN

50%

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. CHANGES IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN JUDGMENT OCCURS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES ON THESE EARNINGS WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANY’S BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZES

THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NETWORK SECURITY AND PRIVACY LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO LIMIT THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO LOSSES SUCH AS THOSE THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF THE COMPANY'S DATA SECURITY. THIS COVERAGE IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 13.

PREPAID ADVERTISING

TELEVISION AND RADIO ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS, ALONG WITH MEDIA PLACEMENT COSTS, ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT FIRST APPEARS. AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS RELATING TO PREPAYMENTS OF PRODUCTION COSTS FOR PRINT AND BROADCAST ADVERTISING AS WELL AS SPONSORSHIP PROMOTIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL AT THE END OF FISCAL

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS’ PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS’ PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL

2014

,

2013

AND

2012

, $865 MILLION

AND $831 MILLION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME. THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS FOR THE CLOSING OF SEVEN STORES IN CHINA IN FISCAL 2012, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. EACH YEAR THE COMPANY MAY ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS, WITH A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT COMPLETED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY

THREE

YEARS. THE COMPANY'S MOST RECENT QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2013.

IN FISCAL 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL FOR ITS U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO REPORTING UNITS. THE COMPANY PERFORMED QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS, CONCLUDING THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IN FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$97 MILLION

TO IMPAIR ALL OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FORMER CHINA REPORTING UNIT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE REMAINING GOODWILL FOR FISCAL

2014

,

2013

OR

2012.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO

TEN

YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL

16.3 MILLION

SHARES OF HD SUPPLY HOLDINGS, INC. ("HD SUPPLY") COMMON STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY

8%

OF THE SHARES OF HD SUPPLY COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING. THIS INVESTMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE COST METHOD, AS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SELL OR TRANSFER ITS HD SUPPLY SHARES. THE RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE THREE LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS OF HD SUPPLY (THE "PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS") FOR SO LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO OWN A CERTAIN PORTION OF THEIR ORIGINAL HOLDINGS OF HD SUPPLY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE HD SUPPLY SHARES WAS IMPAIRED BY THE COMPANY TO A

ZERO

COST BASIS IN FISCAL 2009.

UNDER THE TERMS OF A REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT AMONG THE COMPANY, HD SUPPLY AND THE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS (THE "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), THE COMPANY HAD THE RIGHT TO INCLUDE A PORTION OF ITS SHARES IN THE MAY OFFERING AND ELECTED TO DO SO. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2014, TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS AGAIN ELECTED TO SELL SHARES OF HD SUPPLY COMMON STOCK IN SECONDARY PUBLIC OFFERINGS, AND THE COMPANY AGAIN EXERCISED ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE A PORTION OF ITS SHARES IN THESE OFFERINGS.

12.2 MILLION

SHARES OF HD SUPPLY COMMON STOCK IN FISCAL 2014, FOR WHICH IT RECEIVED $323 MILLION

OF PROCEEDS AND RECOGNIZED A CORRESPONDING GAIN IN FISCAL 2014.

THE TOTAL PRETAX GAIN OF $323 MILLION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES BEGINNING IN

2015

TO

2034

. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE STATE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES RELATED TO FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2015

AND

FEBRUARY 2, 2014

WERE

$6 MILLION

AND

$26 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY

$3.4 BILLION

OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY’S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY APPEALING CERTAIN PROPOSED INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE EXAMINATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR FISCAL YEARS

2005

THROUGH

2007

. THE COMPANY'S U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS

2008

THROUGH

2012

ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE IRS. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AND OTHER FOREIGN AUDITS COVERING FISCAL YEARS

2005

THROUGH

2013

. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY INCOME TAX AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAX EXAMINATIONS COULD REDUCE THE COMPANY'S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY

$270 MILLION

. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS THAN THIS AMOUNT, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DATA BREACH

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, THE COMPANY CONFIRMED THAT ITS PAYMENT DATA SYSTEMS WERE BREACHED, WHICH POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WHO USED PAYMENT CARDS AT SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS IN THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES (THE "DATA BREACH"). THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION TO DATE HAS DETERMINED THE INTRUDER USED A VENDOR’S USER NAME AND PASSWORD TO ENTER

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PERIMETER OF THE COMPANY’S NETWORK. THE INTRUDER THEN ACQUIRED ELEVATED RIGHTS THAT ALLOWED IT TO NAVIGATE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY’S SYSTEMS AND TO DEPLOY UNIQUE, CUSTOM-BUILT MALWARE ON THE COMPANY’S SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS TO ACCESS PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS WHO SHOPPED AT THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES BETWEEN APRIL 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 2014. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DATA BREACH IS ONGOING, AND THE COMPANY IS SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

EXPENSES INCURRED AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED

IN FISCAL 2014, THE COMPANY RECORDED

$63 MILLION

OF PRETAX EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DATA BREACH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$30 MILLION

OF EXPECTED INSURANCE PROCEEDS FOR COSTS THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE REIMBURSABLE AND PROBABLE OF RECOVERY UNDER ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE, FOR PRETAX NET EXPENSES OF

$33 MILLION

LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE EXPENSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS WILL MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THESE CLAIMS WILL LIKELY INCLUDE AMOUNTS FOR INCREMENTAL COUNTERFEIT FRAUD LOSSES AND NON-ORDINARY COURSE OPERATING EXPENSES (SUCH AS CARD REISSUANCE COSTS) THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS ASSERT THEY OR THEIR ISSUING BANKS HAVE INCURRED. IN ORDER FOR THE COMPANY TO HAVE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DETERMINED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT (1) AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH THE PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S NETWORK THAT HANDLES PAYMENT CARD DATA WAS NONCOMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, AND (2) THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE CAUSED AT LEAST SOME PORTION OF THE COMPROMISE OF PAYMENT CARD DATA THAT OCCURRED DURING THE DATA BREACH. ALTHOUGH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ASSESSOR FOUND THE PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S NETWORK THAT HANDLES PAYMENT CARD DATA TO BE COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE DATA SECURITY STANDARDS IN THE FALL OF 2013, AND THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING SUCH CERTIFICATION FOR 2014 WAS ONGOING AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH, IN MARCH 2015 THE FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN OF THOSE STANDARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DATA BREACH. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS WILL MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND THAT THE COMPANY WILL DISPUTE THOSE CLAIMS. WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARE ASSERTED, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE, BASED ON THE FACTS AND INFORMATION THEN AVAILABLE TO IT, WHETHER TO LITIGATE OR SEEK TO SETTLE THOSE CLAIMS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WILL ENSUE AND THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR A LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF LOSSES BECAUSE NO CLAIMS HAVE YET BEEN ASSERTED AND BECAUSE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES KNOWN AND WILL RECORD AN ESTIMATE FOR LOSSES AT THE TIME OR TIMES WHEN IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.
