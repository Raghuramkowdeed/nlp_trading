INTRODUCTION

THE

RETAIL BUSINESSES

HOME DEPOT STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY.

THE OPERATING STRATEGY OF HOME DEPOT IS TO OFFER A BROAD ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY MERCHANDISE

AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES USING HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE, SERVICE-ORIENTED PERSONNEL AND STRONG MARKETING AND CREDIT PROMOTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR MARKETING APPROACH AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. WE REGULARLY CHECK OUR COMPETITORS' PRICES TO ENSURE THAT OUR

PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH MARKET.

CUSTOMERS.

HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.



DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN

PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE EXPERTISE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER MANY D-I-Y "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE VENDORS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD

PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR INSTALLATION. WE ARRANGE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

2



PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN AND TRADESMEN. IN MANY

STORES WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE SELECTIONS AND EXPANDED CREDIT

PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE INCREASE SALES TO THIS GROUP.

PRODUCTS.

A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS APPROXIMATELY 40,000 TO 50,000 PRODUCTS DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING BOTH

NATIONAL BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY ITEMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES OF EACH MAJOR PRODUCT GROUP (AND RELATED SERVICES) FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

WE

BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE VENDOR. MOST OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, WHICH ELIMINATES

"MIDDLEMAN" COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT COMPETITIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

TO

COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT SELECTION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND

NAMES. AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2003, WE OFFERED A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, JOHN DEERE® LAWN AND GARDEN

TRACTORS; THOMASVILLE® KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETS; SILESTONE® COUNTERTOPS; RIDGID® POWER TOOLS; BEHR PREMIUM PLUS® PAINT; MILL'S PRIDE®

CABINETS; HUSKY® HAND TOOLS; GE SMARTWATER WATER

HEATERS; PHILIPS® LIGHT BULBS; TORO® LAWN MOWERS; VIGORO® LAWN CARE PRODUCTS; GAF® ROOFING PRODUCTS; HONDA® LAWN MOWERS AND LITHONIA

LIGHTING FLUORESCENT LIGHTING PRODUCTS. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ALIGNMENTS WITH OTHER SUPPLIERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE RANGE

OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE UNDER BRAND NAMES THAT ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE HOME DEPOT.

WE

MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OVERSEAS MANUFACTURERS, WHICH GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS A BROADER SELECTION OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BETTER

VALUE, WHILE ENHANCING OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANTS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE ITEMS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE OPENED TWO

SOURCING OFFICES LOCATED IN SHANGHAI AND SHENZHEN, CHINA, AND HAVE A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANT LOCATED IN BONN, GERMANY. THESE INITIATIVES ENABLE US TO IMPROVE PRODUCT FEATURES AND QUALITY, TO

IMPORT PRODUCTS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER PRODUCTS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE IF PURCHASED FROM THIRD-PARTY IMPORTERS. WE CURRENTLY SOURCE PRODUCTS

FROM MORE THAN 500 FACTORIES IN APPROXIMATELY 40 COUNTRIES.

SERVICES.

HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION SERVICES. THESE SERVICES TARGET THE D-I-F-M CUSTOMER

WHO SELECTS AND PURCHASES MATERIALS FOR A PROJECT AND PREFERS THE COMPANY TO ARRANGE FOR PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. WE IMPLEMENT OUR INSTALLED SALES PROGRAMS THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES, SUCH AS CARPETING, HARD FLOORING, CABINETS, WATER HEATERS AND SOLID SURFACE COUNTERTOPS, AS

WELL AS THE INSTALLATION BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS GENERATORS AND FURNACE AND CENTRAL AIR

3

SYSTEMS.

IN FISCAL 2003, WE ACQUIRED INSTALLED PRODUCTS U.S.A., A ROOFING AND FENCING INSTALLED SERVICES BUSINESS, AND RMA HOME SERVICES, A REPLACEMENT WINDOWS AND SIDING INSTALLED SERVICES BUSINESS.

STORE-RELATED PROGRAMS.

WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR BUSINESS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY,

THEREBY INCREASING SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED A NUMBER OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT SUPPORTING STORE OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2003, INCLUDING.



PROFESSIONAL

BUSINESS CUSTOMER INITIATIVE

. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

REMODELERS, CARPENTERS, PLUMBERS, PAINTERS, ELECTRICIANS, BUILDING MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS AND DESIGNERS. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR "PRO" INITIATIVE, WHICH ADDS SERVICE-RELATED

PROGRAMS TO OUR STORES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. STORES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM HAVE ADDED ASSOCIATES AT A SALES DESK DEDICATED TO PROVIDING MORE PERSONALIZED

SERVICE TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MANAGING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING AND FILLING ORDERS FOR PICK-UP OR DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE HOURS WHEN PROFESSIONALS TYPICALLY SHOP, THESE STORES

HAVE ASSIGNED SALES ASSOCIATES IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO BETTER ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS. TO BETTER SERVE OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE

AVAILABLE QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PURCHASED BY PROFESSIONALS IN BULK, AND WE OFFER CERTAIN ITEMS IN EACH DEPARTMENT PACKAGED IN BULK TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS. WHILE AIMED AT THE

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER, THIS PROGRAM ALSO ENABLES US TO BETTER SERVE OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMER WITH IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS AND

ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE. THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES IN SERVING OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN MANY OF OUR STORES WITHOUT MATERIAL ADDITIONAL

COSTS. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE HAD EXPANDED THE PRO INITIATIVE INTO 1,356 STORES, 221 OF WHICH WERE ADDED DURING THE YEAR. WE ANTICIPATE THAT DURING FISCAL 2004, WE WILL EXPAND THIS INITIATIVE

TO APPROXIMATELY 78 ADDITIONAL STORES.



COLOR

SOLUTIONS CENTER

. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE INTRODUCED OUR COLOR SOLUTIONS CENTER IN ALL OF OUR HOME DEPOT STORES. THIS INITIATIVE COMBINES

LEADING PAINT BRANDS LIKE BEHR®, GLIDDEN®, DISNEY® AND RALPH LAUREN® WITH PROPRIETARY PAINT MATCHING TECHNOLOGY IN AN ATTRACTIVE, EASY TO SHOP

ENVIRONMENT.



APPLIANCE

SALES

. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE CONTINUED THE ROLL-OUT OF OUR APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO OUR STORES IN THE U.S. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE

SELL APPLIANCES MANUFACTURED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC®, MAYTAG® AND OTHER LEADING MANUFACTURERS. WE DISPLAY AND STOCK THE MORE POPULAR APPLIANCES IN OUR STORES AND OFFER THE ABILITY

TO SPECIAL ORDER APPROXIMATELY 2,000 ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPUTER KIOSKS LOCATED IN THE STORES. THROUGH THE COMPUTER KIOSKS WE CAN CHECK INVENTORY AND ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER

DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS SOON AS 48 HOURS AFTER THE ORDER IS PLACED. APPLIANCE SHOWROOMS WERE IN 1,569 OF OUR STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, AND WE ANTICIPATE ADDING THE APPLIANCE SALES

PROGRAM TO AN ADDITIONAL 228 STORES BY THE END OF FISCAL 2004.



DESIGNPLACE

INITIATIVE

. WE CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT OUR DESIGNPLACE® INITIATIVE DURING FISCAL 2003, ROLLING THE INITIATIVE OUT TO AN

ADDITIONAL 752 STORES AND BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 1,625 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003 FROM 873 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002. THE INITIATIVE OFFERS AN ENHANCED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO OUR DESIGN

AND DÉCOR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING PERSONALIZED SERVICE FROM SPECIALLY-TRAINED ASSOCIATES AND ENHANCED MERCHANDISE SELECTION IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING. WE EXPECT TO ADD THE DESIGNPLACE

INITIATIVE TO AN ADDITIONAL 172 STORES DURING FISCAL 2004.



TOOL

RENTAL CENTERS

. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO SATISFY A BROAD RANGE OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER A TOOL

RENTAL CENTER IN CERTAIN STORES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE RENT APPROXIMATELY 225 COMMERCIAL-QUALITY TOOLS IN 12 CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SAWS, FLOOR SANDERS, GENERATORS, GAS POWERED LAWN EQUIPMENT AND

PLUMBING TOOLS. CUSTOMERS CAN RENT THE TOOLS ON AN HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS. OUR ASSOCIATES WHO WORK IN THE TOOL RENTAL CENTER RECEIVE SPECIAL TRAINING IN THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE

TOOLS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE HAD TOOL RENTAL CENTERS IN 825 STORES COMPARED TO 601 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE

4

ANTICIPATE

HAVING TOOL RENTAL CENTERS IN APPROXIMATELY 1,045 STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT OFFERING THIS SERVICE INCREASES THE SALES OF RELATED MERCHANDISE WITHOUT REDUCING THE SALES OF EQUIPMENT SIMILAR TO

THAT AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL.



CUSTOMER

CONTACT CENTER

. SINCE FISCAL 2001, WE HAVE HAD A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TO ASSIST WITH EXPEDITING SPECIAL ORDERS AND MANAGING

INSTALLATION PROJECTS. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER ALSO SUPPORTS THE SALE AND INSTALLATION OF ROOFING, SIDING, WINDOWS, WATER HEATERS, GUTTERS, FENCING AND HVAC EQUIPMENT NATIONWIDE. CALLS COME INTO

THE CENTER WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ASSIST CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCT SELECTION AND SCHEDULING INSTALLATIONS. THE ORDERS ARE THEN FULFILLED THROUGH OUR STORES OR BY THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOTH IN OUR STORES AND ON THE PHONE, WHILE REDUCING COSTS.



CUSTOMER

EDUCATION PROGRAMS

. WE OFFER SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE THE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS. OUR ASSOCIATES AND VENDORS

TEACH "HOW-TO" CLINICS THAT FOCUS ON D-I-Y PROJECTS, SUCH AS INSTALLING GARBAGE DISPOSALS, LAYING PATIO PAVERS OR BUILDING A DECK. IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICS, WE OFFER HOME DEPOT

UNIVERSITY®, WHICH PRESENTS FOUR-WEEK MODULES ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEVERAL FACETS OF A HOME IMPROVEMENT TOPIC. FOR EXAMPLE, A ROOM ENHANCEMENT MODULE MAY PROVIDE

INSTRUCTION ON PAINT, WALLPAPER AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE INTRODUCED NATIONAL DO-IT-HERSELF WORKSHOPS FOR WOMEN THAT PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON THE HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IDENTIFIED

BY FEMALE CUSTOMERS AS MOST IMPORTANT. OVER 180,000 WOMEN ATTENDED THE FIRST FOUR OF THESE WORKSHOPS. THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT'S KIDS WORKSHOP

SM

PROGRAM, CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN TOOL

SAFETY AND COMPLETE A SMALL BUILDING PROJECT, SUCH AS A BIRDHOUSE OR TOOL BOX. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCREASE OUR SALES BY ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE MORE

PROJECTS, DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OUR COMPETITION AND REINFORCING OUR POSITION AS EXPERTS IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

STORE GROWTH

UNITED

STATES

. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE WERE OPERATING 1,515 HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

DURING FISCAL 2003, WE OPENED 145 NEW HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THESE NEW STORE OPENINGS OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN EXISTING MARKETS, WE CONTINUED OUR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION BY OPENING STORES IN

A NUMBER OF NEW MARKETS.

TO

INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND ENHANCE LONG-TERM MARKET PENETRATION, WE OFTEN OPEN NEW STORES NEAR THE EDGE OF MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES. WHILE THESE

OPENINGS MAY INITIALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMPARABLE STORE SALES, WE BELIEVE THIS "CANNIBALIZATION" STRATEGY INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND OUR OVERALL MARKET SHARE BY REDUCING DELAYS IN

SHOPPING, INCREASING UTILIZATION BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS TO MORE CONVENIENT LOCATIONS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE BELIEVE THAT APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR STORES WERE

CANNIBALIZED BY CERTAIN NEW STORES.

CANADA.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE WERE OPERATING 102 HOME DEPOT STORES IN EIGHT CANADIAN PROVINCES. OF THESE STORES, 13 WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2003.

MEXICO.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE WERE OPERATING 18 STORES IN MEXICO. OF THESE STORES, SIX WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2003.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY.

THE OPERATING STRATEGY BEHIND OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IS TO BE A COMPLETE HOME DECORATING

AND REMODELING RESOURCE. EACH OF THESE STORES OFFERS 10 SPECIALTY BUSINESSES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FEATURES DESIGN SHOWROOMS WITH FULL-SIZE DISPLAYS TO HELP CUSTOMERS VISUALIZE THE END RESULT OF POSSIBLE

INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECTS. TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO OFFER COMPLETE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, WE EMPLOY ASSOCIATES WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING, PLANNING AND

COMPLETING DECORATING AND REMODELING PROJECTS.

5

CUSTOMERS.

TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE MIDDLE TO UPPER INCOME D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS, WHO

PURCHASE MERCHANDISE FOR INSTALLATION BY OTHERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE OFFER INSTALLATION SERVICES THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR MOST OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AT THESE STORES. ADDITIONALLY,

OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY CUSTOM BUILDERS, REMODELERS, DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR

KITCHENS, BATHS AND APPLIANCES, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS FOR LIGHTING, DECORATING AND STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PROJECTS. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF MERCHANDISE IN AN EFFORT TO MEET

THE NEEDS OF SHOPPERS WHOSE INTERIOR DESIGN PREFERENCES MAY GO BEYOND THE ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A HOME DEPOT STORE. WHILE THERE IS MINIMAL OVERLAP BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, THOSE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES REPRESENT A MORE DISTINCTIVE ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN ADDITION TO NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE

ALSO OFFER ITEMS THAT MUST BE SPECIAL ORDERED OR THAT ARE TYPICALLY OFFERED ONLY THROUGH SHOWROOMS.

WE

HAVE ASSOCIATES AT OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES TO ASSIST WITH EVERY PHASE OF A PROJECT. CERTIFIED KITCHEN AND BATH DESIGNERS ARE ON STAFF, AS WELL AS DESIGN PROFESSIONALS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS

DESIGN LIGHTING, TILE AND FLOORING, CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY AND BEDDING, CUSTOM CLOSETS AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. OUR PROJECT MANAGERS ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN SCHEDULE QUALIFIED

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. WE ALSO OFFER SPECIAL TRADE SERVICES, SUCH AS DEDICATED OUTSIDE SALES PEOPLE AND DESIGNERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN HELPING PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

STORE GROWTH.

DURING FISCAL 2003, WE OPENED TWO ADDITIONAL EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, EACH WITH APPROXIMATELY

90,000 SQUARE FEET. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE OPENING ANY ADDITIONAL EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IN FISCAL 2004.

THE WEB SITE IS BILINGUAL TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS IN CANADA'S TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES, ENGLISH AND FRENCH.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

DURING FISCAL 2003, WE INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF OUR

GROWING BUSINESS AND FAMILY OF COMPANIES. CURRENTLY WE PROVIDE BUSINESS INFORMATION THROUGH EXTENSIVE HIGH-SPEED NETWORKS AND THROUGH AN ARRAY OF APPROXIMATELY 135,000 PERSONAL COMPUTERS, 7,000

SERVERS AND 125,000 OTHER NETWORK-CONNECTED DEVICES. THESE SYSTEMS PROVIDE STORE, CORPORATE, FINANCIAL, MERCHANDISING, LOGISTICS AND OTHER BACK OFFICE FUNCTION SUPPORT.

DURING

FISCAL 2003, WE CONTINUED THE INSTALLATION OF SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS AND BEGAN A TOTAL REPLACEMENT OF OUR POS SYSTEMS IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THESE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENT

CUSTOMER CHECK-OUTS AND RETURNS. IN ADDITION, STORE MANAGERS RECEIVED NEW TOOLS FOR LABOR

PLANNING, STAFFING, SCHEDULING AND WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT TO BETTER PLAN ASSOCIATE HOURS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IMPROVE EXECUTION OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES. WE ALSO DEPLOYED

AUTOMATED TOOLS TO ASSIST OUR MERCHANTS WITH ASSORTMENT PLANNING, MARKDOWN MANAGEMENT AND SPACE MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA WAREHOUSE TO CAPTURE, MANAGE AND REPORT

CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR ASSOCIATES AND SALES. WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL PROVIDE OUR MERCHANTS AND OPERATORS WITH MORE TIMELY INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS ON INVENTORY, ORDERS AND

PRICING.

WHILE

OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OUR STORES, WE ARE ALSO MAKING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE CONTINUED MULTI-YEAR

PROJECTS TO UPGRADE OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND CERTAIN ENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP US MANAGE AND CONTROL THE GROWTH AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS, AS

WELL AS PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT REPORTING.

ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 299,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM

APPROXIMATELY 20,600 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 66% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE

GOOD. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET AREA. STORE MANAGERS HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION REGARDING COMPETITIVE SALARY

RATES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

WE

DEVELOP OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF OUR ASSOCIATES. THESE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MANDATORY PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TRAINING CLASSES, ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE

ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS, AND TO EDUCATE, DEVELOP AND TEST THE SKILLS OF OUR ASSOCIATES. BECAUSE WE PRIMARILY PROMOTE OR RELOCATE CURRENT ASSOCIATES TO SERVE AS

MANAGERS AND ASSISTANT MANAGERS FOR NEW STORES, TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATES IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR GROWTH. OUR DISTRICT MANAGERS AND STORE MANAGERS TYPICALLY MEET WITH OUR HUMAN RESOURCES

MANAGERS TO DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND CERTAIN DEPARTMENT HEADS AND CONSIDER POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION.

WE

HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS IN OUR STORES AND DIVISIONAL OFFICES TO ENSURE WE HIRE AND PROMOTE THE MOST QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAY. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS WE HAVE

IS OUR ANNUAL HUMAN RESOURCES REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH ASSESSES LEADERS AND TEAMS, REVIEWS SUCCESSION PLANNING AND EXECUTIVE PIPELINE, HIGH POTENTIAL ASSOCIATES, STAFFING, RETENTION, DIVERSITY, TRAINING

AND COMPLIANCE. THE PROGRAM IS CLOSELY LINKED TO OUR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WHICH EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE, LEADERSHIP AND POTENTIAL OF ALL ASSOCIATES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A LIST OF QUALIFIED

ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN NEW ASSIGNMENTS AND OF QUALIFIED OUTSIDE APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE REVIEWED WHEN POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.

MARKETING.

WE ARE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAIL ADVERTISERS, AND WE UTILIZE A BROAD RANGE OF MASS MEDIA AND

TARGETED MEDIA. WE ALSO INCORPORATE MAJOR SPONSORSHIPS INTO OUR MARKETING PLAN, SUCH AS NASCAR®, THE U.S. OLYMPIC®TEAM, THE HOME DEPOT CENTER

SM

, ESPN GAME

DAY®, CBS® COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND A NUMBER OF HOME AND GARDEN SHOWS. WE EXTEND OUR REACH AND EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROPRIETARY PUBLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE

1-2-3

® HOME IMPROVEMENT BOOK

SERIES AND

STYLE IDEAS

SM

MAGAZINE.

WE

EXECUTE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON BOTH A NATIONAL AND LOCAL BASIS. BECAUSE OUR STORES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO, WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN SMALLER

RETAILERS BY USING NATIONAL ADVERTISING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE TAILOR OUR ADVERTISING LOCALLY TO RESPOND TO MARKET DIFFERENCES, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTS AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

CREDIT SERVICES.

HOME DEPOT OFFERS CREDIT PURCHASE PROGRAMS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS TO BOTH

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS AND D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2003, 2.6 MILLION NEW HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOME DEPOT ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO

APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 24% OF STORE SALES AT FISCAL 2003 YEAR END. WE ALSO OFFER AN UNSECURED HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN THAT GIVES OUR

CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LOAN PROGRAM NOT ONLY SUPPORTS LARGE SALES, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATH REMODELS, BUT ALSO

GENERATES INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR

REGISTRATION FOR A VARIETY OF TRADE NAMES, SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE HOME DEPOT®, EXPO DESIGN CENTER® STORES, HAMPTON

BAY® FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES, GLACIER BAY® TOILETS, SINKS AND FAUCETS, PEGASUS® FAUCETS AND BATH ACCESSORIES, COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC® LIGHTING

FIXTURES, WORKFORCE® TOOLS, TOOL BOXES AND SHELVING AND PREMIUMCUT® LUMBER. WE REGARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

THE MARKETING OF OUR BRAND AND STORES. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

FOR OUR GLOBALLY-SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT WE DIRECTLY IMPORT, WE HAVE A QUALITY ASSURANCE

PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR VENDOR OR FACTORY AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, WHICH MEASURE FACTORS SUCH AS PRODUCT QUALITY, TIMELY SHIPMENTS AND FILL RATE. THE

PERFORMANCE RECORD IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM HAS FOUR COMPONENTS.



WE

AUTHORIZE LABORATORIES TO TEST PRODUCTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS;



WE

DEVELOP AND DOCUMENT PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS, BASED ON TEST RESULTS, APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND FEATURES DETERMINED BY OUR MERCHANTS;



WE

ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF FACTORIES TO MANUFACTURE QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HOME DEPOT

POLICIES; AND



WE

ROUTINELY ASSESS PRODUCT QUALITY AND FACTORY PERFORMANCE BY CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY ON SHIPMENTS TO ASSURE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRODUCT

REQUIREMENTS.

LOGISTICS.

WE USE SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCIES. IMPORT DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS PROCESS OUR GLOBALLY-SOURCED MERCHANDISE. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE HAD 10 IMPORT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE ALSO HAD 30

LUMBER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO SUPPORT THE LUMBER DEMANDS OF OUR STORES AND 10 TRANSIT FACILITIES. AT OUR TRANSIT FACILITIES, WE RECEIVE MERCHANDISE FROM MANUFACTURERS

AND IMMEDIATELY CROSS DOCK IT ONTO TRUCKS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES. WE PLAN TO ADD TWO TRANSIT FACILITIES IN FISCAL 2004. THE TRANSIT FACILITY NETWORK WILL PROVIDE SERVICE TO MORE THAN 90% OF STORES

IN THE CONTINENTAL

9

UNITED

STATES AND MEXICO BY THE END OF 2004. WE ALSO OPERATE OTHER SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR SPECIFIC MERCHANDISE NEEDS. THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES ALLOW US TO PROVIDE

HIGH SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR STORES AT RELATIVELY LOW COSTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE MERCHANDISE SHIPPED TO OUR STORES WAS PROCESSED THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES. AS OUR NETWORKS EVOLVE, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF MERCHANDISE PROCESSED BY OUR FACILITIES. THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WILL BE SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM OUR

VENDORS TO OUR STORES.

IN

ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE SUPPLIES AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE DELIVERY SERVICES DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO

BETTER SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR STORES AND OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO LOWER COSTS.

SAFETY.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT

CONSISTS OF A TEAM OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS IN THE FIELD FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS AN ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT

POLICIES AND PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE. OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING OUR SAFETY PROGRAM, WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STORE-LEVEL ASSOCIATES, STORE AND DIVISION

MANAGEMENT, AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS. THE PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF OUR SAFETY PROGRAM ARE (1) ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFETY STANDARDS AND PROCESSES FOR ALL ASPECTS OF

STORE OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, (2) EFFECTIVE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATES ON ALL APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND (3) MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED SAFETY STANDARDS.

COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH

OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME

PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER

RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. DUE TO THE

VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR SHARE OF THE U.S. HOME IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY IS APPROXIMATELY 11% AND

WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITOR IN OUR MARKETS.

WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 156.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, AND APPROXIMATELY 14% WERE LEASED CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 26.0 MILLION SQUARE

FEET. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE OWNED. WE GENERALLY PREFER TO OWN STORES BECAUSE OF GREATER OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY, GENERALLY LOWER

OCCUPANCY COSTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. WE BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF EXISTING LEASE TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE CAN BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE SPACE FOR LEASE OR

PURCHASE THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE.

OUR

EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 1,774,000 SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. IN ADDITION, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE OCCUPIED AN
