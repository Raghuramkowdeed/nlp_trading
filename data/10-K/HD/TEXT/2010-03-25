OUR BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY.

IN FISCAL 2009, DESPITE PROLONGED DIFFICULTIES IN THE ECONOMY, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE RETAIL BUSINESS, INVESTING IN OUR ASSOCIATES AND

STORES AND IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS FOCUS REFLECTED A CONTINUATION OF STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008), INCLUDING THE DECISION, ANNOUNCED IN LATE JANUARY 2009, TO CLOSE OUR

EXPO DESIGN CENTER, THD DESIGN CENTER, YARDBIRDS AND HD BATH BUSINESSES (THE EXITED BUSINESSES). IN FISCAL 2009, WE MAINTAINED OUR FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR EXISTING STORE BASE. DURING THE YEAR, WE CONTINUED TO

IMPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR STORE OPERATIONS TO MAKE THEM SIMPLER, MORE CONSISTENT AND MORE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED. WE SHIFTED ASSOCIATE HOURS TO BE MORE CUSTOMER FACING, PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TRAINING TO OUR

ASSOCIATES AND REFOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON OFFERING EVERY DAY VALUES IN THE STORES. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS INTENDED TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION, CONTROL EXPENSES AND CREATE LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.



DO-IT-YOURSELF (D-I-Y) CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN

PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME (D-I-F-M) CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD

PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT OR INSTALLATION. WE ARRANGE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF THE HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.



PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND TRADESMEN.

IN MANY STORES, WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE INCREASE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS.

PRODUCTS.

A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TO 40,000 PRODUCTS DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING BOTH

NATIONAL BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY ITEMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES OF EACH MAJOR PRODUCT GROUP (AND RELATED SERVICES) FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

DURING FISCAL 2009, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL

SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WE INVESTED IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND MERCHANDISING TOOLS TO IMPROVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS.

WITH REGARD TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, IN FISCAL 2009 WE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND NEW TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE ALSO MADE ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR

CENTRAL AUTOMATED REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM.

WE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING TOOLS UTILIZED IN MERCHANDISING SYSTEMS

IN THE AREAS OF ASSORTMENT MANAGEMENT, FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT.

WITH OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE STORES, WE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL

TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS DESIGNED TO HELP STORE ASSOCIATES PERFORM THEIR TASKS AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN FISCAL 2009, WE EQUIPPED 1,977 STORES WITH NEW SERVERS, 211 STORES WITH NEW COMPUTERS, REGISTERS AND PRINTERS AND 63 STORES WITH NEW PAINT

DISPENSERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION. PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 25% OF STORE SALES IN FISCAL 2009. IN FISCAL 2008, HOME DEPOT RENEGOTIATED AND EXTENDED THE TERM OF THE PRIMARY CONTRACTS GOVERNING THE PRIVATE LABEL PROGRAM. IN FISCAL 2009, WE CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM OUR NEW CONTRACTS WHICH

ESTABLISHED A CEILING FOR THE COST OF CREDIT FOR THE PROGRAM WHILE RETAINING THE ABILITY FOR PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS TO LOWER THE COST OF CREDIT.

LOGISTICS.

WE CONTINUED OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION IN FISCAL 2009 TO ENSURE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY AND

LOW TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO, WE RESTRUCTURED OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTER (RDC)

BUILD-OUT IN THE U.S. AND GENERAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES. RDCS ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF STORE PRODUCT NEEDS TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER, AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON

ARRIVAL AT THE CENTER. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION, SIMPLIFIED ORDER PROCESSING AT SUPPLIERS AND REDUCED LEAD TIME FROM THE TIME THAT PRODUCT NEEDS AT STORES ARE DETERMINED TO ACTUAL REPLENISHMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES TO OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, IN FISCAL 2009 WE ADDED 5.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, PRIMARILY FOR NEW

RDCS, AND CLOSED OTHER DISTRIBUTION CENTER OPERATIONS OCCUPYING APPROXIMATELY 2.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ELIMINATING CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE IN THE U.S. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, WE OPERATED 30 LUMBER

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, 36 CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TWO TRANSIT FACILITIES, ALL LOCATED IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO. ADDITIONALLY IN FISCAL 2009, WE OPENED SEVEN NEW RDCS IN THE U.S., BRINGING OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF RDCS TO 12. WE NOW

SERVE APPROXIMATELY 1,250 OF OUR U.S. STORES FROM RDCS, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 65% OF OUR U.S. STORES, AND HAVE ONBOARDED APPROXIMATELY 35% OF OUR COSTS OF SALES FOR THOSE STORES. WE PLAN TO OPEN ADDITIONAL RDCS DURING FISCAL 2010 AND

ULTIMATELY SERVE ALL OF OUR U.S. STORES FROM RDCS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OUR OVERALL RDC ROLL-OUT STRATEGY, SUPPORTING OUR GOAL OF INCREASING OUR CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION PENETRATION.

ASSOCIATES.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 317,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 19,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN

HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 61% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE VERY GOOD. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS

IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

OUR BUSINESS HAS ONE OF THE MOST

RECOGNIZED BRANDS IN NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE HOME DEPOT

®

TRADEMARK HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE

AND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS, E-COMMERCE, STORES AND BUSINESS. WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION OF TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY,

FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN PATENT PORTFOLIOS RELATING TO SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SEEK TO PATENT OR OTHERWISE PROTECT INNOVATIONS WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

WE HAVE BOTH QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES THAT ARE DEDICATED TO OVERSEEING THE

QUALITY OF OUR DIRECTLY IMPORTED, GLOBALLY-SOURCED AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AT THE FACTORY, PRODUCT AND PACKAGING LEVELS. THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR SUPPLIER AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR

PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL SAFETY, QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND TO ALLOW US TO MEASURE AND TRACK THE TIMELINESS OF SHIPMENTS. WE ALSO HAVE A SUPPLIER SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT

OUR SUPPLIERS ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY

(EH&S).

WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. OUR EH&S FUNCTION IN THE FIELD

IS DIRECTED BY TRAINED ASSOCIATES FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE EXECUTION OF THE EH&S PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A STORE SUPPORT CENTER-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED EH&S PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES,

PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS.

THE HOME DEPOT IS COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN

ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, ENERGY USAGE, SUPPLY CHAIN, PRODUCT SELECTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

IN FISCAL 2009, WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY-RELATED PROJECTS AND SAVED OVER 114 MILLION KILOWATT HOURS (KWH) COMPARED

ADHERENCE TO STRICT LIGHTING SCHEDULES, WHICH ARE THE LARGEST SOURCES OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR STORES, AS WELL AS UTILIZING THE NOVAR ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND ALARM SYSTEM IN EACH STORE TO MONITOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING

AND UTILIZING THESE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS, WE HAVE SAVED OVER 2.6 BILLION KWH SINCE 2004, ENOUGH TO POWER APPROXIMATELY 203,000 U.S. HOMES FOR ONE YEAR. WE HAVE ACHIEVED A 16 PERCENT REDUCTION IN KWH PER SQUARE FOOT OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR

U.S. STORES SINCE 2004, AND OUR GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE A 20 PERCENT REDUCTION IN OUR U.S. STORES BY 2015, THROUGH OUR ENERGY CONSERVATION INITIATIVES. WE HAVE ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE U.S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL AND HAVE BUILT SEVEN LEADERSHIP IN

TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED

BELOW INCLUDE THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE RELATED POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT

ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY

OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CAUSING OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO

PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE

STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL  COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF

DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER

SERVICES, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS,

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE

OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER

LOYALTY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND

TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS

IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AS TO SERVICE LEVELS, SPENDING PATTERNS AND

HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE

ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO

BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO

NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES, THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OR LABOR RELATIONS, SUCH AS THE PROPOSED EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT, AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION,

WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED

TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, OUR CENTRALIZATION OF CERTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES FUNCTIONS MIGHT NOT BE READILY ADAPTED BY OUR

ASSOCIATES AND THEREFORE MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR

PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER

RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY.

RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

WE RELY ON

THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET

OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR

ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS

PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS (PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS), SUPPLIERS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR

ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS

AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

ANY SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY DATA SECURITY COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SECURED DATA ARE ADEQUATE TO SAFEGUARD

AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS

AND MANAGE TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DATA IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS. WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR

OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING

THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN

EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A

RESULT OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE

REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TAX REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. PASSAGE OF THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OR OTHER SIMILAR LAWS IN CONGRESS COULD LEAD TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS BY ENCOURAGING UNIONIZATION EFFORTS AMONG OUR ASSOCIATES AND DISRUPTION OF STORE OPERATIONS. HEALTHCARE REFORM, IF

ENACTED, COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS AND OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS UNDER OUR BENEFIT PLANS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A BACK-UP

CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A STRONG INVESTMENT GRADE RATING AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL

FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN

DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN OUR

U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN

ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FCPA AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICE BUSINESS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES

AND LAWSUITS.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS.

AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE

PROTECTIONS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVENTORIES,

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR

JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT

ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

OF OUR 2,244 STORES OPERATING AT THE END

OF FISCAL 2009, APPROXIMATELY 89% WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 209.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET, AND APPROXIMATELY 11% OF SUCH STORES WERE LEASED CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 25.8 MILLION

SQUARE FEET.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, WE UTILIZED 188 WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN 33 STATES OR PROVINCES, CONSISTING

OF APPROXIMATELY 32.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION IS OWNED AND APPROXIMATELY 31.9 MILLION IS LEASED.

OUR EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF, DIVISIONAL STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, WE OCCUPIED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IN JULY 2005, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS HANDLING, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS PROCEEDING, IT DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SUCH OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INFORMAL REQUEST FROM THE STAFF OF THE SEC FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS RETURN-TO-VENDOR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. SUBSEQUENT TO AUGUST 2005, THE SEC STAFF REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE SEC STAFF LAST CONTACTED THE COMPANY REGARDING THIS MATTER IN JANUARY

2007. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THE REQUESTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC STAFF. THE SEC HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMAL INQUIRY IS NOT AN INDICATION THAT ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAW HAVE OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS INFORMAL INQUIRY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND, IN SOME CASES, AGAINST CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DESCRIBED

BELOW. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THEIR OUTCOME, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ACTIONS, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, THREE PURPORTED, BUT UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE

HOME DEPOT FUTUREBUILDER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN VIOLATION OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA)

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS RETURN-TO-VENDOR AND STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE JOINED INTO ONE CASE IN 2007, AND THE JOINT AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS CERTIFICATION AS A CLASS ACTION, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, COSTS, ATTORNEYS

FEES AND EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE CASE IS CURRENTLY BEFORE THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA, FOLLOWING THE DECISION BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT IN JULY 2008

REVERSING THE DISTRICT COURTS PRIOR DECISION ON STANDING, AFFIRMING ITS FINDING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO EXHAUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER ERISA, AND REMANDING THE MATTER TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER ADJUDICATION. ON

NOVEMBER 9, 2009, PLAINTIFFS FILED A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOLLOWING THEIR PURSUIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON JANUARY 27, 2010, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN

CALIFORNIA APPROVED THE COMPANYS SETTLEMENT WITH THE PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE LAWSUITS CONTAINING MULTIPLE CLASS-ACTION ALLEGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO PROVIDE MEAL BREAKS. THE COMPLAINTS WERE FILED BY CURRENT AND FORMER HOURLY ASSOCIATES

FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE DISPOSITION OF THIS MATTER IS NOW COMPLETE. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR THIS SETTLEMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. THE SETTLEMENT

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA

FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010 (FISCAL 2009), WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF $2.7 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.57 COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS OF $2.3 BILLION

AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.34 FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008).

THE RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2009 AND

2008 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL STRATEGIC ACTIONS INITIATED IN FISCAL 2008. THESE STRATEGIC ACTIONS RESULTED IN STORE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES RELATED TO THE CLOSING OF 15 UNDERPERFORMING STORES AND THE REMOVAL OF APPROXIMATELY 50 STORES FROM OUR

NEW STORE PIPELINE, BUSINESS RATIONALIZATION CHARGES RELATED TO THE EXIT OF OUR EXPO, THD DESIGN CENTER, YARDBIRDS AND HD BATH BUSINESSES (THE EXITED BUSINESSES) AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

(COLLECTIVELY, THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES). THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN PRETAX RATIONALIZATION CHARGES OF $146 MILLION AND $951 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR FISCAL 2009 AND 2008 RESULTS INCLUDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $163 MILLION IN EACH YEAR TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY, INC. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2009 INCLUDED EARNINGS OF $41 MILLION FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $52 MILLION FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, IN FISCAL 2008 FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

WE REPORTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.6 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.55 FOR FISCAL 2009

COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.3 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.37 FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWNS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY,

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.8 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.66 FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $3.0 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.78 FOR FISCAL 2008.

NET SALES DECREASED 7.2% TO $66.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $71.3 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2008. THE SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, HOUSING AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2009. OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINED 6.6% IN FISCAL 2009

DRIVEN BY A 6.3% DECLINE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE AVERAGE TICKET TO $51.65, AS WELL AS A 0.3% DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR OUR U.S. STORES DECLINED 6.2% IN FISCAL 2009.

IN FISCAL 2009, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE RETAIL BUSINESS, INVESTING IN OUR ASSOCIATES AND STORES AND IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE ROLL-OUT OF

OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST TRAINING TO ALL STORE ASSOCIATES AND SUPPORT STAFF IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009 HAS BROUGHT SIMPLIFICATION AND FOCUS ACROSS THE BUSINESS, AND WE ARE SEEING THE BENEFIT OF THIS IN IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE RATINGS FOR

FISCAL 2009.

WE ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON OUR MERCHANDISING TOOLS IN THE U.S. THAT HELPED US TO BETTER MANAGE MARKDOWN AND CLEARANCE

ACTIVITY AND TO BETTER CONTROL INVENTORY. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, OUR INVENTORY HAD DECREASED BY $485 MILLION, OR 4.5%, FROM FISCAL 2008. ADDITIONALLY, OUR AVERAGE INVENTORY PER STORE DECREASED BY 3.3% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO LAST

YEAR. WE CONTINUED OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION TO IMPROVE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, WE HAD 12 RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS (RDCS) OPERATING THAT SERVE APPROXIMATELY 65% OF OUR U.S. STORES. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO

OUR OVERALL RDC ROLL-OUT STRATEGY, SUPPORTING OUR GOAL OF INCREASING OUR CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION PENETRATION. OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION ALSO INCLUDES RESTRUCTURING OUR STOCKING DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.

WE OPENED 13 NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2009, CLOSED TWO STORES IN CHINA AND CLOSED 41 STORES RELATED TO OUR EXITED BUSINESSES, BRINGING OUR TOTAL STORE COUNT AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2009 TO 2,244. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009, A TOTAL OF 268 STORES, OR APPROXIMATELY 12%, WERE LOCATED IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA COMPARED TO 262 STORES, OR APPROXIMATELY 12%, AS OF FISCAL 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR

FISCAL 2009 DECREASED 7.2% TO $66.2 BILLION FROM $71.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WELL AS THE NET IMPACT OF FEWER OPEN STORES IN FISCAL 2009

VERSUS FISCAL 2008. TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 6.6% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF 8.7% FOR FISCAL 2008.

THERE WERE A

NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, HOUSING AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT, AND CONSUMERS WERE CHALLENGED DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING HIGHER

UNEMPLOYMENT. WE SAW RELATIVE STRENGTH IN OUR BUILDING MATERIALS, FLOORING, PAINT, PLUMBING AND GARDEN/SEASONAL PRODUCT CATEGORIES AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN THESE AREAS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2009. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR

OUR LUMBER, HARDWARE, ELECTRICAL, KITCHEN/BATH AND MILLWORK PRODUCT CATEGORIES WERE BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2009. IN FISCAL 2009, WE ALSO SAW SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST ALL CURRENCIES. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE

RATES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR TOTAL COMPANY SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $565 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO LAST YEAR.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

SALES PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN, AND COULD CONTINUE TO BE, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS MARKETS. WE ESTIMATE OUR SHARE OF THE U.S. HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET IS APPROXIMATELY 21%.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 6.6%

TO $22.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $24.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 33.9% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 33.7% FOR FISCAL 2008, AN INCREASE OF 22 BASIS POINTS. THROUGH OUR FOCUSED BAY PORTFOLIO

APPROACH, OUR U.S. MERCHANTS CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE NEW LOWER PRICES WHILE GROWING OVERALL GROSS MARGIN. ADDITIONALLY, GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKDOWNS AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR.

OPERATING EXPENSES

SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) DECREASED 10.9% TO $15.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $17.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 24.0% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING

THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 23.9% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 23.7% FOR FISCAL 2008. OUR SG&A RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF A NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES ENVIRONMENT, OFFSET BY A LOWER

COST OF CREDIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND SOLID EXPENSE CONTROL. FOR FISCAL 2009, THE PENETRATION OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES WAS 25.1% COMPARED TO 28.1% FOR FISCAL 2008.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION DECREASED 4.4% TO $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.6% FOR FISCAL 2009 AND 2.5% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 10.2% TO $4.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009

FROM $4.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.3% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 6.1% FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.5% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 7.4% FOR FISCAL 2008.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

IN FISCAL 2009, WE RECOGNIZED $821 MILLION OF INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET, COMPARED TO $769 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.2% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 1.1% FOR FISCAL 2008. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, REFLECTS A $163 MILLION CHARGE IN EACH OF FISCAL

2009 AND 2008 TO WRITE-DOWN OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGES, INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.0% FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO 0.9% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF

NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED TO 34.2% FOR FISCAL 2009 FROM 35.6% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECTS

BENEFITS ARISING FROM A FAVORABLE FOREIGN TAX SETTLEMENT AND REALIGNMENT OF OUR FOREIGN CORPORATE STRUCTURE. THESE BENEFITS POSITIVELY IMPACTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.06 FOR FISCAL 2009.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.55 FOR FISCAL 2009 AND $1.37 FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWNS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY,

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2009 WERE $1.66 COMPARED TO $1.78 FOR FISCAL 2008, A DECREASE OF 6.7%.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL

2009 CONSIST OF EARNINGS OF $41 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $52 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2008, IN EACH CASE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM

THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL 2009 AND 2008, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE

RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NET SALES FROM EXITED BUSINESSES DURING THE PERIOD FROM CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT TO ACTUAL CLOSING, AND THE CHARGES TO WRITE-DOWN OUR

INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BETTER ENABLE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH

MEANINGFUL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO EVENTS OF UNUSUAL NATURE OR FREQUENCY. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008 (FISCAL 2007)

NET SALES

FISCAL 2008 CONSISTED OF

52 WEEKS COMPARED TO 53 WEEKS IN FISCAL 2007. NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 DECREASED 7.8% TO $71.3 BILLION FROM $77.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE

STORE SALES AND $1.1 BILLION OF NET SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN FISCAL 2007, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET SALES OF $1.8 BILLION FROM NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2008. COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 8.7% FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO A

DECREASE OF 6.7% FOR FISCAL 2007.

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE

U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT AND CONSUMERS WERE CHALLENGED DUE TO HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT AND AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD TIGHTENING OF CONSUMER CREDIT AVAILABILITY. WE SAW RELATIVE STRENGTH IN BUILDING

MATERIALS, PLUMBING, GARDEN/SEASONAL AND HARDWARE AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN THESE AREAS WERE ABOVE OR AT THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2008. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR LUMBER, FLOORING, PAINT, ELECTRICAL, KITCHEN/BATH AND MILLWORK WERE BELOW THE

COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2008. SOFTNESS IN OUR BIG TICKET CATEGORIES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AVERAGE TICKET, WHICH DECREASED 3.3% TO $55.61 FOR FISCAL 2008. OUR NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED APPROXIMATELY 5% OF OUR EXISTING STORES AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2008, WHICH HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 1%.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 7.7% TO $24.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM $26.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 33.7%

FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 33.6% FOR FISCAL 2007, AN INCREASE OF FOUR BASIS POINTS. THIS GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION INCLUDED $30 MILLION IN MARKDOWNS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. EXCLUDING THESE MARKDOWNS, OUR GROSS PROFIT

AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED EIGHT BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2008, REFLECTING OUR FOCUSED BAY PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO PRODUCT ASSORTMENT.

OPERATING EXPENSES

SG&A INCREASED 4.7% TO $17.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM $17.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. AS A

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF EXPENSE DELEVERAGE IN THE NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 70 BASIS POINTS DUE TO

A HIGHER COST OF CREDIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. FOR FISCAL 2008, THE PENETRATION OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES WAS 28.1% COMPARED TO 29.4% FOR FISCAL 2007.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 4.9% TO $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.5% FOR FISCAL 2008 AND 2.2% FOR FISCAL 2007. THE INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES DELEVERAGE AND THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN SHORTER LIVED ASSETS SUCH AS STORE RESETS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING

INCOME DECREASED 39.8% TO $4.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM $7.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 6.1% FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 9.4% FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES,

OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.4% FOR FISCAL 2008.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.1% FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 0.8% FOR FISCAL 2007.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2008.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED TO 35.6% FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM 36.4% FOR FISCAL 2007. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2008 REFLECTS LOWER

STATE AND FOREIGN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.37 FOR FISCAL 2008 AND $2.27 FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2008 WERE $1.78, A DECREASE OF 21.6% FROM FISCAL 2007. THE 53

RD

WEEK IN FISCAL 2007 INCREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR

FISCAL 2007.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE

REPURCHASED 2.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $70 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008 AND 293 MILLION SHARES FOR $10.8 BILLION IN FISCAL 2007.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL

2008 CONSIST OF A LOSS OF $52 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE, RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2007 CONSIST OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR HD SUPPLY THROUGH AUGUST 30, 2007 AND A $4 MILLION LOSS ON THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. NET SALES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $7.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 AND EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, WERE

$185 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2009, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$5.1 BILLION COMPARED TO $5.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THIS CHANGE WAS A RESULT OF LOWER EARNINGS EXCLUDING NONCASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND REDUCED CASH FLOWS FROM WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS $755 MILLION COMPARED TO $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF $881 MILLION LESS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008.

IN FISCAL 2009, WE SPENT $966 MILLION ON

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: 26% FOR MERCHANDISING AND OPERATIONS, 19% FOR MAINTENANCE, 19% FOR CORE TECHNOLOGY, 15% FOR NEW STORES AND 21% FOR OTHER INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2009, WE ADDED 13 NEW STORES.

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS $3.5 BILLION COMPARED WITH $3.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO REPAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2008 OF $1.7 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $282 MILLION OF STRUCTURED FINANCING DEBT COMPARED TO $1.8 BILLION IN REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL 2009.

WE REPURCHASED 7.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $213 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009 AND 2.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $70 MILLION IN FISCAL

2008. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 753.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $27.5 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, $12.5 BILLION REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.25 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

PROGRAMS, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.25 BILLION. AS

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF JANUARY 31, 2010, THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS OR THE RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2010 AND CONTAINS

VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS, AND THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. IN AUGUST 2009, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC

FOR THE POTENTIAL FUTURE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES, REPLACING A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAD EXPIRED.

WE USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING

LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND CURRENT

INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 44.7%

COMPARED TO 54.4% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, WE GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED AMORTIZING TERM LOAN

(GUARANTEED LOAN) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE, WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION, IS RECORDED AS A LIABILITY AND INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WE ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO $1.0 BILLION AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF NONPAYMENT BY HD SUPPLY. THE GUARANTEED LOAN IS COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN ASSETS OF HD SUPPLY. THE ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE OF THE GUARANTEE WAS AUGUST 30, 2012. ON

MARCH 19, 2010, WE AMENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE AND EXTENDED IT TO APRIL 1, 2014.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, WE HAD $1.4 BILLION IN CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND

FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.

AT JANUARY 31, 2010, WE HAD OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THAT EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 16, 2013 WITH A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION THAT SWAP FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $1.25 BILLION 5.25% SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 259 BASIS POINTS. AT JANUARY 31, 2010, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS AN ASSET

OF $12 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A

FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF ISSUING LONG-TERM DEBT TO REFINANCE DEBT MATURING IN FISCAL 2010. AT

JANUARY 31, 2010, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THIS AGREEMENT WAS AN ASSET OF $3 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT.

DURING FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $3.0 BILLION, THAT SWAPPED FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $3.0 BILLION

5.40% SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE RATE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 60 TO 149 BASIS POINTS. IN FISCAL 2008, WE RECEIVED $56 MILLION TO SETTLE THESE SWAPS, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED TO REDUCE NET INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING

TERM OF THE DEBT.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OPERATING LEASES FOR A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

EXCLUDES $636 MILLION OF NONCURRENT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE USED, AT TIMES, TO MANAGE OUR FIXED/FLOATING DEBT PORTFOLIO. AT JANUARY 31, 2010,

AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 87% OF OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AND 13% WAS FLOATING-RATE DEBT. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE INTEREST COSTS OF FLOATING-RATE DEBT WOULD

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $9.3 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES

OUTSTANDING. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.5 BILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND

DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT

OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR

USE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR

HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS

DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 82% VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE THE HOME DEPOT, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF

MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE

ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER A

COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE

END OF FISCAL 2009 OR 2008.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION

CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED

TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR

THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED

BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 OR 2007.

SELF-INSURANCE

WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITY REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS ESTABLISHED

BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE

INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO

THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 OR 2007.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR

THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED

AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF VENDOR ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF

SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN

SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENTS DECISION

TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS

PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS

OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENTS ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN

OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO

RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

MARKET COMPETITION AND INFLATION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE STORES WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS OF OWNED LOCATIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SUBLEASE INCOME AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE FOR LEASED LOCATIONS.

AS PART OF OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, WE RECORDED NO ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND $84 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO $580 MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE

OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2008. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. A 10% DECREASE IN ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME AND A 10% INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE WOULD NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ALSO RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS ON OTHER CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT DO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS

WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK

SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET COMPETITION, INFLATION AND DISCOUNT RATES. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

FOR THE REPORTING UNITS TESTED WOULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED WOULD ALSO RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE FROM 1 TO 20 YEARS, UNLESS

SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. WE RECORDED NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 OR 2007.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION AND THE HIERARCHY OF

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (FASB ASC 105-10), WHICH ESTABLISHES THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (CODIFICATION) AS THE SOLE SOURCE FOR AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GAAP AND SUPERSEDES ALL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS IN U.S. GAAP, ASIDE FROM THOSE ISSUED BY THE SEC. FASB ASC 105-10 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THE CODIFICATION DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CODIFICATION, REFERENCES TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY FASB ASC REFERENCES.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDMENTS TO FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R) (FASB ASC 810-10), WHICH CLARIFIES THAT THE

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE AN ENTITY IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ENTITYS PURPOSE AND DESIGN AND A COMPANYS ABILITY TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE

ENTITYS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. FASB ASC 810-10 REQUIRES ONGOING REASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND ELIMINATES THE QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY CONCEPT. FASB ASC 810-10 ALSO

REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT A COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT IN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN RISK EXPOSURE DUE TO THAT INVOLVEMENT. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2009, FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD, AND FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS THEREAFTER. THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY THAT UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS OR

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS (WHETHER PAID OR UNPAID) ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN

PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT

CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG

LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINS THE

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY. BOTH THE

COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE

PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK

IN

INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 IN PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED ON PAGE 30 IN

THE HOME

DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010,

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT INC.S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS,

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC.

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 AND FEBRUARY 1, 2009, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS,

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010, AND OUR REPORT DATED MARCH 25, 2010 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) OPERATE THE HOME

DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY 105,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TO 40,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND

GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY WAS OPERATING 2,244 STORES, WHICH INCLUDED 1,976 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO AND THE TERRITORIES OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND GUAM (U.S.), 179 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CANADA, 79 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN MEXICO AND 10 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CHINA. THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL YEAR

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY

NEAREST TO JANUARY 31. FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010 (FISCAL 2009) AND FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008) INCLUDE 52 WEEKS. THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008 (FISCAL 2007) INCLUDES

53 WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN THIS NOTE 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANYS

CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HIGH-GRADE COMMERCIAL PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON CURRENT

MARKET RATES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT

CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE RELATED RECEIVABLES. WE EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER

EXPIRES IN 2018, WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE

INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE CARDS

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND THE PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A). THE SUM OF THE THREE IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY

AS THE COST OF CREDIT OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT

DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $38 MILLION AND $37 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 AND FEBRUARY 1, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS VALUATION RESERVE RELATED

TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009 OR 2008.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 18%

OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009 OR 2008.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE

PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN

THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS,

AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS

INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME

TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY.

ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES FOR THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANYS BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER. THE COMPANYS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED USING THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

LIFE

BUILDINGS

5  45 YEARS

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3  20 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

5  45 YEARS

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND

AMORTIZES THESE COSTS USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH IS THREE TO SIX YEARS. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CERTAIN

DEVELOPMENT COSTS NOT MEETING THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE

LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS

RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN

NET SALES. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED BASED UPON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION PATTERNS AND REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF GIFT CARDS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDEMPTION BY THE CUSTOMER IS REMOTE. DURING FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND

2007, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $40 MILLION, $37 MILLION AND $36 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. THIS INCOME IS RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME AND IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AS A

REDUCTION IN SG&A.

SERVICES REVENUE

NET SALES INCLUDE SERVICES REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION, HOME MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS. IN THESE PROGRAMS, THE CUSTOMER SELECTS AND PURCHASES MATERIAL FOR A

PROJECT AND THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANYS STORES. UNDER CERTAIN PROGRAMS, WHEN THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES THE INSTALLATION OF A PROJECT AND THE SUBCONTRACTOR

PROVIDES MATERIAL AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION, BOTH THE MATERIAL AND LABOR ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES REVENUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETE.

ALL PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF SERVICES ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. SERVICES REVENUE

WAS $2.6 BILLION, $3.1 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND

MEDICAL CLAIMS. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL

ESTIMATES.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREPAID ADVERTISING

TELEVISION AND RADIO ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS, ALONG WITH MEDIA PLACEMENT COSTS, ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT FIRST APPEARS. AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS RELATING TO PREPAYMENTS OF PRODUCTION COSTS FOR PRINT AND BROADCAST ADVERTISING AS WELL AS SPONSORSHIP PROMOTIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009 AND 2008.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF

PURCHASES.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND

A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN

OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007, GROSS ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $897 MILLION, $1.0 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND IS INCLUDED IN SG&A. SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE ADVERTISING

CO-OP ALLOWANCES WERE $105 MILLION, $107 MILLION AND $120 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

COST OF SALES

COST OF SALES INCLUDES THE

ACTUAL COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD AND SERVICES PERFORMED, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS TO THE COMPANYS STORES, LOCATIONS OR CUSTOMERS, THE OPERATING COST OF THE COMPANYS SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE

COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

THE COST OF HANDLING AND SHIPPING

MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANYS STORES, LOCATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE CUSTOMER IS CLASSIFIED AS SG&A. THE COST OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING, INCLUDING INTERNAL COSTS AND PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES, CLASSIFIED AS SG&A WAS

$426 MILLION, $501 MILLION AND $571 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT

PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENTS ASSUMPTIONS OF

CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE

IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

AS PART OF ITS RATIONALIZATION CHARGES, THE COMPANY RECORDED NO ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND $84 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO $580

MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS IN FISCAL 2008. SEE NOTE 2 FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. THE COMPANY ALSO

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

DURING

FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM, INCLUDING A NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM, FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA. ALONG WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA FROM THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET USING A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD. AS OF THE END OF

FISCAL 2008, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM AND RELATED CONVERSION TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD FOR CANADIAN RETAIL OPERATIONS WAS COMPLETE.

THE NEW ERP SYSTEM ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO UTILIZE THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL RESULT IN GREATER PRECISION IN THE COSTING OF INVENTORIES AND A BETTER MATCHING OF COST

OF SALES WITH REVENUE GENERATED. THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE ON THE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCES WAS NOT MATERIAL. PRIOR TO THE INVENTORY SYSTEM CONVERSION, THE COMPANY COULD NOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGE TO THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD, AND THEREFORE, COULD NOT RETROACTIVELY APPLY THE CHANGE TO PERIODS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2008.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 360-10, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED THE RESULTS OF HD SUPPLY AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE

EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

AT JANUARY 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES FROM 2010 TO 2028. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES ARE IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE EXPIRATION PERIOD IS TOO SHORT TO BE ASSURED OF

UTILIZATION. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AT JANUARY 31, 2010 AND

FEBRUARY 1, 2009 WERE $15 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS SALE OF HD SUPPLY, THE COMPANY INCURRED A

TAX LOSS, RESULTING IN A NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER OF APPROXIMATELY $244 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010. A PORTION OF THE NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL EXPIRE IF NOT USED BY 2013 AND THE REMAINING PORTION WILL EXPIRE IN 2014. HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL BE REALIZED BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADEQUATE CAPITAL GAIN INCOME DURING THE CARRYOVER PERIOD. THEREFORE, NO VALUATION

ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY $456 MILLION OF

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

ON JANUARY 29, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FASB ASC 740-10 RELATED TO UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. THIS GUIDANCE REQUIRES APPLICATION OF A MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD TO THE RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION

OF TAX POSITIONS. IT FURTHER REQUIRES THAT A CHANGE IN JUDGMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS TAX POSITIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTER OF SUCH CHANGE. THIS ADOPTION REDUCED THE COMPANYS RETAINED EARNINGS AT JANUARY 29, 2007 BY $111

MILLION. A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS AS FOLLOWS (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS).

THE ACCRUAL FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $41 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009, DECREASED BY $19 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008 AND INCREASED BY $32 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007. TOTAL ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS OF JANUARY 31, 2010 AND

FEBRUARY 1, 2009 ARE $138 MILLION AND $109 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTEREST AND PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OPERATING EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY.
