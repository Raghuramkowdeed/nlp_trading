PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

INTRODUCTION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. ("HOME DEPOT" OR THE "COMPANY") IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER AND THE SECOND LARGEST RETAILER IN THE UNITED STATES, BASED ON NET

SALES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 30, 2005 ("FISCAL 2004"). AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING 1,890 STORES. MOST OF OUR STORES ARE EITHER HOME DEPOT® STORES OR EXPO

DESIGN CENTER® STORES. A DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THESE TYPES OF STORES IS AS FOLLOWS.

HOME

DEPOT STORES SELL A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE A NUMBER OF SERVICES. HOME DEPOT STORES AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 106,000 SQUARE

FEET OF ENCLOSED SPACE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 22,000 ADDITIONAL SQUARE FEET IN THE OUTSIDE GARDEN AREA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE HAD 1,818 HOME DEPOT STORES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

(INCLUDING THE TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS), CANADA AND MEXICO. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY FOR HOME DECORATING AND REMODELING PROJECTS. UNLIKE

HOME DEPOT STORES, EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES DO NOT SELL BUILDING MATERIALS AND LUMBER. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETRY, SOFT AND HARD

FLOORING, WINDOW TREATMENTS AND LIGHTING FIXTURES. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 SQUARE FEET OF ENCLOSED SPACE. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING 54 EXPO DESIGN

CENTER STORES IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN

ADDITION TO HOME DEPOT AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, WE ALSO HAVE TWO STORE FORMATS FOCUSED ON PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS CALLED THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY STORE AND HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY. AT THE END

OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING FIVE THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY STORES AND 11 HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES. WE ALSO HAVE TWO STORES LOCATED IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA CALLED THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORE

THAT SELL PRIMARILY FLOORING PRODUCTS. OUR LANDSCAPE SUPPLY LOCATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO EXTEND THE REACH OF HOME DEPOT'S GARDEN DEPARTMENTS, FOCUSING ON PROFESSIONAL LANDSCAPERS AND

DO-IT-YOURSELF GARDEN ENTHUSIASTS. EACH LOCATION HAS A HEATED/COOLED SPACE OF ABOUT 12,000 SQUARE FEET, A COVERED GREENHOUSE

1

AND

1 TO 3 ACRES OF FENCED-IN "PRO-YARD." WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO OPEN A TOTAL OF 175 STORES DURING FISCAL 2005.

THE

HOME DEPOT SUPPLY DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS AND SELLS INSTALLATION SERVICES PRIMARILY TO BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2004, THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH FIVE

SUBSIDIARIES, APEX SUPPLY COMPANY, INC. ("APEX SUPPLY COMPANY"), YOUR OTHER WAREHOUSE, LLC ("YOUR OTHER WAREHOUSE"), THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY, INC. ("THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY"), WHITE CAP

INDUSTRIES, INC. ("WHITE CAP") AND HD BUILDER SOLUTIONS GROUP, INC. ("HD BUILDER SOLUTIONS GROUP"). APEX SUPPLY COMPANY, THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY, AND HD BUILDER SOLUTIONS GROUP CONDUCT

BUSINESS UNDER THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY BRAND, AND HD BUILDERS SOLUTIONS GROUP ALSO CONDUCTS BUSINESS UNDER THE CREATIVE TOUCH INTERIORS BRAND. APEX SUPPLY COMPANY IS A WHOLESALE SUPPLIER OF PLUMBING,

HVAC, APPLIANCES AND OTHER RELATED PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS WITH 26 LOCATIONS IN FLORIDA, GEORGIA, SOUTH

CAROLINA AND TENNESSEE. YOUR OTHER WAREHOUSE IS A PLUMBING, LIGHTING AND HARDWARE DISTRIBUTOR THAT FOCUSES ON SPECIAL ORDER FULFILLMENT THROUGH FIVE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN GEORGIA, LOUISIANA,

MARYLAND AND NEVADA AND ONE CALL CENTER LOCATED IN LOUISIANA. THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY SUPPLIES MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATING PRODUCTS SERVING PRIMARILY THE MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING, HOSPITALITY AND

LODGING FACILITIES MANAGEMENT MARKET. THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY FILLS ORDERS THROUGH 20 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ILLINOIS, MARYLAND,

RETAIL BUSINESSES

HOME DEPOT STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY.

THE OPERATING STRATEGY OF HOME DEPOT IS TO OFFER A BROAD ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY

MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES USING KNOWLEDGEABLE, SERVICE-ORIENTED PERSONNEL AND STRONG MARKETING AND CREDIT PROMOTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSOCIATES'

KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR MARKETING APPROACH AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

CUSTOMERS.

HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.



DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE EXPERTISE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT

BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE VENDORS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M")

CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR INSTALLATION. WE

ARRANGE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

2



PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN AND

TRADESMEN. IN MANY STORES WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE SELECTIONS AND

EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE INCREASE SALES TO THIS GROUP.

PRODUCTS.

A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS 40,000 TO 50,000 PRODUCTS DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING BOTH NATIONAL

BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY ITEMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES OF EACH MAJOR PRODUCT GROUP (AND RELATED SERVICES) FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

WE

BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE SUPPLIER. MOST OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, WHICH

ELIMINATES "MIDDLEMAN" COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT COMPETITIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

TO

COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT SELECTION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED

BRAND NAMES. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE OFFERED A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, JOHN DEERE® LAWN AND GARDEN

TRACTORS; THOMASVILLE® KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETS; SILESTONE® COUNTERTOPS; RIDGID® POWER TOOLS; BEHR PREMIUM PLUS® PAINT; MILL'S PRIDE®

CABINETS; HUSKY® HAND TOOLS; GE SMARTWATER WATER

HEATERS; PHILIPS® LIGHT BULBS; TORO® LAWN MOWERS; VIGORO® LAWN CARE PRODUCTS; GAF® ROOFING PRODUCTS; HONDA® LAWN MOWERS AND LITHONIA

LIGHTING FLUORESCENT LIGHTING PRODUCTS. WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER SUPPLIERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE RANGE

OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE UNDER BRAND NAMES THAT ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE HOME DEPOT.

WE

MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS. THIS GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS A BROADER SELECTION OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND

BETTER VALUE, WHILE ENHANCING OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANTS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE ITEMS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE TWO

SOURCING OFFICES LOCATED IN SHANGHAI AND SHENZHEN, CHINA, AND HAVE A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANT LOCATED IN BONN, GERMANY. WE ALSO HAVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANTS, AS WELL AS A SOURCING OFFICE, IN

MONTERREY, MEXICO. THESE INITIATIVES ENABLE US TO IMPROVE PRODUCT FEATURES AND QUALITY, TO IMPORT PRODUCTS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER PRODUCTS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN WOULD

OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE IF PURCHASED FROM THIRD-PARTY IMPORTERS. WE CURRENTLY SOURCE PRODUCTS FROM MORE THAN 600 FACTORIES IN APPROXIMATELY 35 COUNTRIES.

SERVICES.

HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION SERVICES. THESE SERVICES TARGET

D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS WHO SELECT AND PURCHASE MATERIALS FOR A PROJECT AND THEN ARRANGE FOR PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION THROUGH THE COMPANY. OUR INSTALLED SALES PROGRAMS

USE ONLY QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES, SUCH AS CARPETING, FLOORING, CABINETS, WATER

HEATERS AND COUNTERTOPS, AS WELL AS OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS GENERATORS AND FURNACE AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS.

3

STORE-RELATED PROGRAMS.

WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR BUSINESS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY,

THEREBY INCREASING SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED A NUMBER OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT SUPPORTING STORE OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL

2004, INCLUDING.



PROFESSIONAL

BUSINESS CUSTOMER INITIATIVE

. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

REMODELERS, CARPENTERS, PLUMBERS, PAINTERS, ELECTRICIANS, BUILDING MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS AND DESIGNERS. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR "PRO" INITIATIVE, WHICH ADDS SERVICE-RELATED

PROGRAMS TO OUR STORES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. STORES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM HAVE ADDED ASSOCIATES AT A SALES DESK DEDICATED TO PROVIDING MORE PERSONALIZED

SERVICE TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING MANAGING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING AND FILLING ORDERS FOR PICK-UP OR DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE HOURS WHEN PROFESSIONALS TYPICALLY SHOP,

THESE STORES HAVE ASSIGNED SALES ASSOCIATES IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO BETTER ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE AVAILABLE QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PURCHASED BY PROFESSIONALS IN

BULK, AND WE OFFER CERTAIN ITEMS IN EACH DEPARTMENT

PACKAGED IN BULK TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS. WHILE AIMED AT THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER, THIS PROGRAM ALSO ENABLES US TO PROVIDE D-I-Y CUSTOMERS WITH IMPROVED CUSTOMER

SERVICE, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS AND ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE. THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES IN SERVING OUR

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN MANY OF OUR STORES WITHOUT MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE HAD EXPANDED THE PRO INITIATIVE INTO 1,563 STORES, 207 OF WHICH

WERE ADDED DURING THE YEAR. WE ANTICIPATE THAT DURING FISCAL 2005, WE WILL EXPAND THIS INITIATIVE TO APPROXIMATELY 165 ADDITIONAL STORES, INCLUDING NEW STORES.



APPLIANCE

SALES

. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE CONTINUED THE ROLL-OUT OF OUR APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM ON OUR WEB SITE AND THROUGHOUT OUR

STORES IN THE U.S. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE SELL APPLIANCES MANUFACTURED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC®, MAYTAG® AND OTHER LEADING MANUFACTURERS. WE DISPLAY AND STOCK THE MORE POPULAR

APPLIANCES IN OUR STORES AND OFFER THE ABILITY TO SPECIAL ORDER APPROXIMATELY 2,300 ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPUTER KIOSKS LOCATED IN STORES. THROUGH THE COMPUTER KIOSKS WE CAN CHECK INVENTORY

AND ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS SOON AS 48 HOURS AFTER THE ORDER IS PLACED. APPLIANCE SHOWROOMS WERE IN 1,787 OF OUR STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004,

AND WE ANTICIPATE ADDING THE APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO AN ADDITIONAL 165 STORES BY THE END OF FISCAL 2005.



DESIGNPLACE

INITIATIVE

. WE CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT OUR DESIGNPLACE® INITIATIVE DURING FISCAL 2004, ROLLING THE INITIATIVE OUT TO AN

ADDITIONAL 162 STORES AND BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 1,787 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004 FROM 1,625 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003. THIS INITIATIVE OFFERS AN ENHANCED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO OUR DESIGN

AND DÉCOR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING PERSONALIZED SERVICE FROM SPECIALLY-TRAINED ASSOCIATES AND ENHANCED MERCHANDISE SELECTION IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING. WE EXPECT TO ADD THE DESIGNPLACE

INITIATIVE TO 165 ADDITIONAL STORES DURING FISCAL 2005.



TOOL

RENTAL CENTERS

. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO SATISFY A BROAD RANGE OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y

CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER A TOOL RENTAL CENTER IN CERTAIN STORES. WE RENT APPROXIMATELY 350 COMMERCIAL-QUALITY TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT IN 12 CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SAWS, FLOOR SANDERS, GENERATORS, GAS POWERED

LAWN EQUIPMENT AND PLUMBING TOOLS. CUSTOMERS CAN RENT THE TOOLS ON AN HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS. OUR ASSOCIATES WHO WORK IN THE TOOL RENTAL CENTER RECEIVE SPECIAL TRAINING IN THE USE AND

MAINTENANCE OF TOOLS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE HAD TOOL RENTAL CENTERS IN 1,061 STORES COMPARED TO 825 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2005, WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TOOL

RENTAL CENTERS IN APPROXIMATELY 1,186 STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT OFFERING THIS SERVICE INCREASES THE SALES OF RELATED MERCHANDISE WITHOUT REDUCING THE SALES OF EQUIPMENT SIMILAR TO THAT AVAILABLE FOR

RENTAL.



CUSTOMER

CONTACT CENTER

. SINCE FISCAL 2001, WE HAVE HAD A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TO ASSIST WITH EXPEDITING SPECIAL ORDERS AND MANAGING

INSTALLATION PROJECTS. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER ALSO

4

SUPPORTS

THE SALE AND INSTALLATION OF ROOFING, SIDING, WINDOWS, WATER HEATERS, GUTTERS, FENCING AND HVAC EQUIPMENT NATIONWIDE. CALLS COME INTO THE CENTER WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ASSIST

CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCT SELECTION AND SCHEDULING INSTALLATIONS. THE ORDERS ARE THEN FULFILLED THROUGH OUR STORES OR BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. DURING 2005, WE ANTICIPATE OPENING AN ADDITIONAL

CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TO SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY 500-750 ADDITIONAL STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTERS HELP US PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOTH IN OUR STORES AND ON THE

PHONE, WHILE REDUCING COSTS.



CUSTOMER

EDUCATION PROGRAMS

. WE OFFER SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE THE SKILLS OF OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS. OUR ASSOCIATES AND

VENDORS TEACH "HOW-TO" CLINICS THAT FOCUS ON D-I-Y PROJECTS, SUCH AS INSTALLING GARBAGE DISPOSALS, LAYING PATIO PAVERS OR BUILDING A DECK. IN ADDITION TO THE

CLINICS, WE OFFER HOME DEPOT UNIVERSITY®, WHICH PRESENTS FOUR-WEEK MODULES ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEVERAL FACETS OF A HOME IMPROVEMENT TOPIC. FOR EXAMPLE, A ROOM

ENHANCEMENT MODULE MAY PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON PAINT, WALLPAPER AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT'S KIDS WORKSHOP

SM

PROGRAM, CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN TOOL SAFETY AND

COMPLETE A SMALL BUILDING PROJECT, SUCH AS A BIRDHOUSE OR TOOL BOX. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCREASE OUR SALES BY ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE MORE PROJECTS,

DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OUR COMPETITION AND REINFORCING OUR POSITION AS EXPERTS IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

STORE GROWTH

UNITED STATES

. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING 1,657 HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO

AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE OPENED 142 NEW HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THESE NEW STORE OPENINGS OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN EXISTING MARKETS, WE CONTINUED OUR GEOGRAPHIC

EXPANSION BY OPENING STORES IN A NUMBER OF NEW MARKETS.

TO

INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND ENHANCE LONG-TERM MARKET PENETRATION, WE OFTEN OPEN NEW STORES NEAR THE EDGE OF MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES.

WHILE THESE OPENINGS MAY INITIALLY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THIS "CANNIBALIZATION" STRATEGY INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND OUR OVERALL MARKET SHARE BY

REDUCING DELAYS IN SHOPPING, INCREASING UTILIZATION BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS TO MORE CONVENIENT LOCATIONS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE BELIEVE THAT APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR

STORES WERE CANNIBALIZED BY CERTAIN NEW STORES.

CANADA.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING 117 HOME DEPOT STORES IN NINE CANADIAN PROVINCES. OF THESE STORES, 15 WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2004. DURING FISCAL

2005, WE PLAN TO OPEN 19 ADDITIONAL STORES IN CANADA.

MEXICO.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE WERE OPERATING 44 STORES IN MEXICO. OF THESE STORES, 20 WERE ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE JUNE 2004 ACQUISITION OF HOME MART

MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V., THE SECOND LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER IN MEXICO. DURING FISCAL 2005, WE PLAN TO OPEN 10 ADDITIONAL STORES IN MEXICO.

CHINA.

AT THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ARRANGEMENT TO LEASE COMMERCIAL SPACE IN SHANGHAI TO SUPPORT A RETAIL INITIATIVE IN CHINA. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

PURSUING ITS STRATEGY FOR ENTRY INTO THE CHINA HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETPLACE.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY.

THE OPERATING STRATEGY BEHIND OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IS TO BE A COMPLETE HOME DECORATING

AND REMODELING RESOURCE. EACH STORE OFFERS 12 SPECIALTY BUSINESSES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FEATURES DESIGN SHOWROOMS WITH FULL-SIZE DISPLAYS TO HELP CUSTOMERS VISUALIZE THE END RESULT OF

INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECTS. TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO OFFER COMPLETE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, WE EMPLOY ASSOCIATES WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING, PLANNING AND

COMPLETING DECORATING AND REMODELING PROJECTS.

5

CUSTOMERS.

TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE MIDDLE- TO UPPER- INCOME

D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS, WHO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE FOR INSTALLATION BY OTHERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE OFFER INSTALLATION SERVICES THROUGH QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR

MOST OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AT THESE STORES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY CUSTOM BUILDERS, REMODELERS, DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR

KITCHENS, BATHS, APPLIANCES AND FLOORING, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS FOR LIGHTING, DECORATING AND STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PROJECTS. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF MERCHANDISE IN AN EFFORT

TO

MEET THE NEEDS OF SHOPPERS WHOSE INTERIOR DESIGN PREFERENCES MAY BE BEYOND THE ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A HOME DEPOT STORE. WHILE THERE IS MINIMAL OVERLAP BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN HOME DEPOT STORES

AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, THOSE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES REPRESENT A MORE DISTINCTIVE ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN ADDITION TO NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND NAME PRODUCTS,

WE ALSO OFFER ITEMS THAT MUST BE SPECIAL ORDERED OR THAT ARE TYPICALLY OFFERED ONLY THROUGH SHOWROOMS.

STORE GROWTH.

DURING FISCAL 2004, WE DID NOT OPEN ADDITIONAL EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT

ANTICIPATE OPENING ADDITIONAL EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IN FISCAL 2005.

TO GROW AND EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THE CENTER WILL ALSO BE USED TO HOUSE ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, LEVERAGING HIGH-TECH RESOURCES FROM ANOTHER GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. WE

ALSO UPGRADED OUR IN-STORE WIRELESS NETWORKS TO THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN MOBILE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS RECEIVING, ORDERING, AND IMPROVED ASSOCIATE

COMMUNICATIONS.

WE

CONTINUED TO IMPROVE OUR TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPANY'S STORES. WE IMPLEMENTED SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS IN OVER 1,000 STORES AND COMPLETED THE ROLL-OUT OF OUR NEW

POINT-OF-SALE SOFTWARE PLATFORM, INCLUDING NEW CORDLESS SCAN GUNS. THESE SYSTEM UPGRADES FURTHER ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE.

WHILE

OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OUR STORES, WE HAVE MADE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE COMPLETED THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF SAP'S CORE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SAP CONSOLIDATED AND STREAMLINED OUR STORE-BASED FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND PROVIDED AN INCREASE IN FUNCTIONALITY WHILE REMAINING

SCALABLE TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED GROWTH. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NEW HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO ASSIST IN ASSOCIATE TRACKING, PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND CAREER PLANNING. IN ADDITION, WE

DELIVERED SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION IN THE AREAS OF SALES, INVENTORY AND LABOR VIA OUR NEW ENTERPRISE DATA WAREHOUSE.

ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 325,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM

APPROXIMATELY 23,700 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 68% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE GOOD. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE.

WE

DEVELOP OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. THESE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MANDATORY PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TRAINING CLASSES, ARE DESIGNED TO

INCREASE ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS, AND TO EDUCATE, DEVELOP AND TEST THE SKILLS OF OUR ASSOCIATES. BECAUSE WE PRIMARILY PROMOTE OR RELOCATE CURRENT ASSOCIATES TO

SERVE AS MANAGERS AND ASSISTANT MANAGERS FOR NEW STORES, TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATES IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR GROWTH. OUR DISTRICT MANAGERS AND STORE MANAGERS TYPICALLY MEET WITH OUR HUMAN

RESOURCES MANAGERS TO DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND DEPARTMENT HEADS.

WE

HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS IN OUR STORES AND DIVISIONAL OFFICES TO ENSURE THAT WE HIRE AND PROMOTE THE MOST QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAY. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

PROGRAMS WE HAVE IS OUR ANNUAL HUMAN RESOURCES REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH ASSESSES LEADERS AND TEAMS, REVIEWS SUCCESSION PLANNING AND EXECUTIVE PIPELINE, HIGH POTENTIAL ASSOCIATES, STAFFING, RETENTION,

DIVERSITY, TRAINING AND COMPLIANCE. THE PROGRAM IS CLOSELY LINKED TO OUR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WHICH EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE, LEADERSHIP AND POTENTIAL OF ALL ASSOCIATES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A

LIST OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN NEW ASSIGNMENTS AND OF QUALIFIED OUTSIDE APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE REVIEWED WHEN POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.

MARKETING.

WE ARE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAIL ADVERTISERS, AND WE UTILIZE A BROAD RANGE OF MASS MEDIA AND

TARGETED MEDIA. WE ALSO INCORPORATE MAJOR SPONSORSHIPS INTO OUR MARKETING PLAN, SUCH AS NASCAR®, THE U.S. OLYMPIC® TEAM, THE HOME DEPOT CENTER, ESPN GAME DAY®,

CBS® COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND A NUMBER OF HOME AND GARDEN SHOWS. WE EXTEND OUR REACH AND EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROPRIETARY PUBLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE

1-2-3

® HOME IMPROVEMENT BOOK SERIES.

WE

EXECUTE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON BOTH A NATIONAL AND LOCAL BASIS. BECAUSE OUR STORES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO, WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN SMALLER

RETAILERS BY USING NATIONAL ADVERTISING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE TAILOR OUR ADVERTISING LOCALLY TO RESPOND TO MARKET DIFFERENCES, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTS AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

CREDIT SERVICES.

HOME DEPOT OFFERS CREDIT PURCHASE PROGRAMS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS TO BOTH

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS AND D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2004, APPROXIMATELY 3.1 MILLION NEW HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE

OPENED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOME DEPOT ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO APPROXIMATELY 14.0 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 24% OF STORE SALES AT FISCAL

2004 YEAR END. WE ALSO OFFER AN UNSECURED HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN THAT GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

LOAN PROGRAM NOT ONLY SUPPORTS LARGE SALES, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATH REMODELS, BUT ALSO GENERATES INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED

FOR REGISTRATION FOR A VARIETY OF TRADE NAMES, SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HOME DEPOT®; EXPO DESIGN CENTER® STORES;

HAMPTON BAY® FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES; GLACIER BAY® TOILETS,

SINKS AND FAUCETS; PEGASUS® FAUCETS AND BATH ACCESSORIES; COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC® LIGHTING FIXTURES; WORKFORCE® TOOLS, TOOL BOXES AND SHELVING; AND

PREMIUMCUT® LUMBER. WE REGARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR BRAND AND STORES. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS

THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

FOR OUR GLOBALLY-SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT WE DIRECTLY IMPORT, WE HAVE A QUALITY ASSURANCE

PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR SUPPLIER AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, WHICH MEASURE FACTORS SUCH AS PRODUCT QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF SHIPMENTS. THE PERFORMANCE RECORD IS

MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM ADDRESSES THREE MAIN COMPONENTS: THE FACTORY, PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING.



THE

FACTORY DEVELOPMENT GROUP ENSURES ALL DIRECT IMPORT FACTORIES ARE ASSESSED AND QUALIFIED TO MANUFACTURE QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AS

WELL AS TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HOME DEPOT POLICIES;



THE

PRODUCT ENGINEERING GROUP AUTHORIZES LABORATORIES TO TEST PRODUCTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE AND ENSURES THAT QUALIFIED INSPECTORS CONDUCT INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY TO ENSURE

CONSISTENT COMPLIANCE WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS, APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND FEATURES DETERMINED BY OUR MERCHANTS; AND



THE

PACKAGE ENGINEERING GROUP AUTHORIZES LABORATORIES TO TEST PACKAGING PRIOR TO PURCHASE AND ENSURES THAT QUALIFIED INSPECTORS INSPECT PACKAGING AT THE FACTORY TO ENSURE

CONSISTENT COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RELEVANT REQUIREMENTS.

LOGISTICS.

WE USE SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCIES. IMPORT DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS PROCESS OUR GLOBALLY-SOURCED MERCHANDISE. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE HAD 13 IMPORT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE ALSO HAD 30

LUMBER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO SUPPORT THE LUMBER DEMANDS OF OUR STORES AND 10 TRANSIT FACILITIES. AT OUR TRANSIT FACILITIES, WE RECEIVE MERCHANDISE FROM MANUFACTURERS

AND IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE TRANSFER ONTO TRUCKS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES. THE TRANSIT FACILITY NETWORK WILL PROVIDE SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR STORES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES BY THE

END OF 2005. WE ALSO OPERATE OTHER SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR SPECIFIC MERCHANDISE NEEDS. THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES ALLOW US TO PROVIDE HIGH SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR STORES

AT RELATIVELY LOW COSTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE MERCHANDISE SHIPPED TO OUR STORES WAS PROCESSED THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES. AS OUR

NETWORKS EVOLVE, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF MERCHANDISE PROCESSED BY OUR FACILITIES. THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WILL BE SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR STORES.

IN

ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE SUPPLIES AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE DELIVERY SERVICES DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO

BETTER SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR STORES AND OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO LOWER COSTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY (EH&S).

WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

AND ASSOCIATES, AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. OUR EH&S DEPARTMENT CONSISTS OF A TEAM OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS IN THE FIELD FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EDUCATION

AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS AN ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED EH&S PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES AND PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE. OUR EH&S DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MANAGING OUR GLOBAL EH&S PROGRAM, WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STORE-LEVEL ASSOCIATES, STORE AND DIVISION MANAGEMENT, AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS. THE PRIMARY

ELEMENTS OF OUR EH&S PROGRAM ARE (1) ESTABLISHMENT OF EH&S STANDARDS AND PROCESSES FOR ALL ASPECTS OF STORE OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, (2) EFFECTIVE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATES

ON ALL APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND (3) VERIFYING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED EH&S STANDARDS.

COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH

OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME

PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER

RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. DUE TO THE

VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR SHARE OF THE U.S. HOME IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY IS APPROXIMATELY 12% AND

WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITOR IN OUR MARKETS.

OF

OUR 1,890 HOME DEPOT STORES, EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES, THE HOME DEPOT SUPPLY STORES AND THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORES, AT FISCAL 2004 YEAR END

APPROXIMATELY 86% WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 173 MILLION SQUARE FEET, AND APPROXIMATELY 14% OF SUCH STORES WERE LEASED CONSISTING

OF APPROXIMATELY 27.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE OWNED. WE GENERALLY PREFER TO OWN STORES BECAUSE OF GREATER

OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY, GENERALLY LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. WE BELIEVE THAT AT

THE END OF EXISTING LEASE TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE CAN BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE SPACE FOR LEASE OR PURCHASE THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE.

OUR

EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2004, WE OCCUPIED AN

18.0 MILLION IS LEASED.
