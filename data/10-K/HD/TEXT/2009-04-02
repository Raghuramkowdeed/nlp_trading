OUR

BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY.

IN FISCAL 2008,

DESPITE THE CONTINUING DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WE

CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE RETAIL BUSINESS, INVESTING IN OUR

ASSOCIATES AND STORES AND IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE

SHIFTED OUR FOCUS FROM NEW SQUARE FOOTAGE GROWTH TO MAXIMIZING

THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR EXISTING STORE BASE. DURING THE YEAR, WE

IMPLEMENTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR STORE OPERATIONS TO MAKE

THEM SIMPLER, MORE CONSISTENT AND MORE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED. WE

SHIFTED ASSOCIATE HOURS TO BE MORE CUSTOMER FACING AND REFOCUSED

OUR EFFORTS ON OFFERING EVERY DAY VALUES IN THE STORES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MADE SEVERAL STRATEGIC DECISIONS WHICH ARE

INTENDED TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION, CONCENTRATE OUR

EFFORTS ON OUR CORE BUSINESS AND CREATE LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR

SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING OUR DECISION TO CLOSE 15 STORES, REMOVE

APPROXIMATELY 50 STORES FROM OUR NEW STORE PIPELINE AND EXIT OUR

EXPO, THD DESIGN CENTER, YARDBIRDS AND HD BATH BUSINESSES.

CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE

THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.



DO-IT-YOURSELF (D-I-Y)

CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME

OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND

INSTALLATIONS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME (D-I-F-M)

CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME

OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES

TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT OR INSTALLATION, OR BOTH. WE ARRANGE FOR

THE INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF THE HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS THROUGH

QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.



PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN, SMALL

BUSINESS OWNERS AND TRADESMEN. IN MANY STORES, WE OFFER A

VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND

WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE

SELECTIONS AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE

INCREASE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS.

PRODUCTS.

A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE

STORE

SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

DURING FISCAL

2008, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO

BETTER SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL

SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WE INVESTED IN OUR SUPPLY

CHAIN AND MERCHANDISING TOOLS TO IMPROVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

CAPABILITIES AND STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS.

WE COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE

PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM TO OUR CANADIAN DIVISION,

WHICH INCLUDES ALL STORES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. WE WILL

ASSESS THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM IN

THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010 (FISCAL

2009) AS WE EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR

U.S. APPLICATION FOOTPRINT.

WITH REGARD TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, WE IMPLEMENTED A NEW WAREHOUSE

MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE U.S. AND CANADIAN STORES,

CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT

SYSTEM, COMPLETED A TECHNOLOGY REFRESH AT OUR DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS, AND IMPLEMENTED IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR CENTRAL AUTOMATED

REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM.

WE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TOOLS UTILIZED IN MERCHANDISING

SYSTEMS IN THE AREAS OF ASSORTMENT MANAGEMENT, FORECASTING, AND

REPLENISHMENT.

WITH OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE STORES, WE PROVIDED TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS DESIGNED TO HELP STORE ASSOCIATES PERFORM THEIR

TASKS AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE EQUIPPED 1,100 STORES

WITH NEW COMPUTERS, REGISTERS AND PRINTERS, AND 920 STORES

RECEIVED NEW PAINT DISPENSERS.

CREDIT SERVICES.

WE OFFER SIX CREDIT

PROGRAMS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS TO PROFESSIONAL,

D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2008, APPROXIMATELY

3.2 MILLION NEW THE HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED,

AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS

WAS APPROXIMATELY 12.5 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD

SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 28% OF STORE SALES IN FISCAL

2008. IN FISCAL 2008, HOME DEPOT RE-NEGOTIATED AND EXTENDED THE

TERM OF THE PRIMARY CONTRACTS GOVERNING THE PROGRAMS. THE NEW

CONTRACT WITH CITIBANK ESTABLISHED A CEILING FOR THE COST OF

CREDIT FOR THE PROGRAM WHILE RETAINING THE ABILITY FOR PORTFOLIO

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS TO LOWER THE COST OF CREDIT.

LOGISTICS.

OUR LOGISTICS PROGRAMS ARE

DESIGNED TO ENSURE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVE

USE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY AND LOW TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN

COSTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008, WE OPERATED 30 LUMBER

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, 45 CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND

FIVE TRANSIT FACILITIES, ALL LOCATED IN THE U.S., CANADA AND

MEXICO. ADDITIONALLY IN 2008, WE OPENED FOUR NEW RAPID

DEPLOYMENT CENTERS (RDC) IN THE U.S., BRINGING OUR

TOTAL NUMBER OF RDCS TO FIVE. WE NOW SERVE APPROXIMATELY 25% OF

OUR U.S. STORES FROM RDCS. RDCS ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF

STORE PRODUCT NEEDS TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER, AND THEN RAPID

ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARRIVAL AT THE CENTER. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS IMPROVED

TRANSPORTATION, SIMPLIFIED ORDER PROCESSING AT SUPPLIERS AND

REDUCED LEAD TIME FROM THE TIME THAT PRODUCT NEEDS AT STORES ARE

DETERMINED TO ACTUAL REPLENISHMENT. WE PLAN TO OPEN ADDITIONAL

RDCS DURING FISCAL 2009 AND 2010 AND ULTIMATELY SERVE ALL OF OUR

U.S. STORES FROM RDCS.

IN FISCAL 2008, APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE MERCHANDISE SHIPPED TO

OUR U.S. STORES FLOWED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WAS SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS TO

OUR STORES. THE EXPANSION OF THE RDC NETWORK IS EXPECTED TO

INCREASE OUR DISTRIBUTION UTILIZATION. IN ADDITION TO

REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE DELIVERY

OF IN-STOCK AND SPECIAL ORDER PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

ASSOCIATES.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008,

WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 322,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM

APPROXIMATELY 22,500 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER

COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 65%

OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE VERY GOOD. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND

WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THROUGH OUR

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE HAVE REGISTERED OR

APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION, IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FOR A

VARIETY OF INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES, SERVICE MARKS AND TRADEMARKS

FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HOME

MAINTAIN PATENT PORTFOLIOS RELATING TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOME DEPOT, AND CONTINUALLY SEEK TO

PATENT OR OTHERWISE PROTECT SELECTED INNOVATIONS WE INCORPORATE

INTO OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE REGARD OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO OUR

BUSINESS AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF

OUR BRAND,

E-COMMERCE,

STORES AND NEW AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

WE HAVE BOTH

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES WHO OVERSEE THE

QUALITY OF OUR DIRECTLY IMPORTED, GLOBALLY-SOURCED AND

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS. THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR SUPPLIER AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE THAT

ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE OUR PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE

AND LOCAL QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THESE PROGRAMS ALSO

ALLOW US TO MEASURE AND TRACK TIMELINESS OF SHIPMENTS. THESE

PERFORMANCE RECORDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW

THEM TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE PROGRAM ADDRESSES QUALITY

ASSURANCE AT THE FACTORY, PRODUCT AND PACKAGING LEVELS.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY

(EH&S).

WE ARE COMMITTED TO

MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES

AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO

BUSINESS. OUR EH&S FUNCTION IN THE FIELD IS DIRECTED BY

TRAINED ASSOCIATES FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE EXECUTION OF THE

EH&S PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A STORE SUPPORT

CENTER-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED EH&S PROFESSIONALS WHO

EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND

PROGRAMS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

THE HOME DEPOT IS

COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, ENERGY

USAGE, PRODUCT SELECTION AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION.

IN FISCAL 2008, WE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $27.5 MILLION FOR

ENERGY EFFICIENCY RELATED PROJECTS. BY REPLACING HVAC UNITS IN

APPROXIMATELY 200 EXISTING STORES AND SWITCHING TO THE USE OF

T-5 LIGHTING IN APPROXIMATELY 700 EXISTING STORES, WE ESTIMATE

CUMULATIVE SAVINGS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION SINCE

FISCAL 2006. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED STRICT OPERATIONAL

STANDARDS THAT ESTABLISH ENERGY EFFICIENT PRACTICES IN ALL OF

OUR FACILITIES. THESE INCLUDE HVAC UNIT TEMPERATURE REGULATION

AND ADHERENCE TO STRICT LIGHTING SCHEDULES, WHICH ARE THE

LARGEST SOURCES OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR STORES, AS WELL AS

UTILIZING THE NOVAR ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND ALARM SYSTEM IN EACH

STORE TO MONITOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT BY

IMPLEMENTING AND UTILIZING THESE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS WE HAVE

AVOIDED 1.6 BILLION POUNDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

SINCE FISCAL 2006. WE BELIEVE THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO REMOVING

APPROXIMATELY 132,000 CARS FROM THE HIGHWAY. IN JUNE 2008, WE

LAUNCHED A NATION-WIDE IN-STORE COMPACT FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULB

RECYCLING PROGRAM. THIS SERVICE IS OFFERED TO ALL CUSTOMERS

FREE-OF-CHARGE

AND IS AVAILABLE IN ALL U.S. STORES, INCLUDING ALASKA AND

HAWAII.

WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO FURTHER OUR

SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS. WE PARTNERED WITH THE U.S. GREEN

BUILDING COUNCIL AND HAVE BUILT SEVEN LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN CERTIFIED AND

EQUIVALENT STORES. WE OFFSET THE CARBON EMISSIONS CREATED BY OUR

FACILITIES AND A PORTION OF THOSE EMISSIONS CREATED BY

BUSINESS-RELATED TRAVEL THROUGH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

CONSERVATION FUND THAT RESULTED IN THE PLANTING OF THOUSANDS OF

TREES THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE HEAT-ISLAND EFFECT IN URBAN

AREAS, REDUCE EROSION AND HELP CLEAN THE AIR. THROUGH OUR ECO

OPTIONS

SM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROGRAM, WE HAVE CREATED PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS

TO EASILY IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERRED PRODUCT SELECTIONS

IN OUR STORES. WE IMPLEMENTED A SUPPLIER SOCIAL AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT OUR

SUPPLIERS ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SOCIAL AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL

TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES

OCCURS IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME

OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE

SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES,

ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND

LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE

WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE

STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING

SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS. DUE TO

THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY

MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. THE RISK

FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW INCLUDE THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE

POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION

WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS

THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS

REPORT, GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THEM TO BE

MATERIAL. SUCH FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

THE

STATE OF THE HOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS,

RISING COSTS, A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING,

WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD FURTHER

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

IN 2008, THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT MARKETS HAVE DETERIORATED DRAMATICALLY AND MORE

SEVERELY THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. WE EXPECT THE

DETERIORATION TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2009 AND OUR FISCAL 2009 NET

SALES AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

TO DECLINE FROM FISCAL 2008. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING

INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE

COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE STATE OF THE CREDIT

MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER

CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND

OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL  COULD FURTHER

ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS COULD

INCREASE OUR COSTS AND CAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING

OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

WE

RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND

DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED

SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS

PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS

WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR

QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND

EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS,

SUPPLIERS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE

RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT

CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE

MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO

DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED

SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED

BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE

ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR

COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE

PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF

NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE

CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE

GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A

LONG-TERM BANK

LINE-OF-CREDIT

COMMITMENT. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A STRONG INVESTMENT

GRADE RATING AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OBLIGATIONS

AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THE

CURRENT RECESSIONARY TRENDS PERSIST OR WORSEN. CONTINUED

VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF

CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES

COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE

INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT

FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE

INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW

OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO

OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A BETTER

EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES COULD

DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR

TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED

TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT

TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS,

OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

WE MAY

NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS,

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET

SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO

EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES.

FAILURE TO DESIGN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR

EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES,

SPENDING PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE

INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR

PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SALES AND PROFIT

MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER

RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION,

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID

AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT OUR SALES

AND PROFIT MARGINS.

OUR

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN

FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING

WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE

REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS

GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TAX REGULATIONS

COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. ALSO, PASSAGE OF THE

EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OR OTHER SIMILAR LAWS IN CONGRESS COULD

LEAD TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS BY ENCOURAGING UNIONIZATION EFFORTS

AMONG OUR ASSOCIATES AND DISRUPTION OF STORE OPERATIONS.

OUR

SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN

HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES.

TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE

NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE CONTROLLING LABOR

COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS

EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND

OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE

IN HOURLY POSITIONS WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH TURNOVER RATES. WE

COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR THESE ASSOCIATES AND

INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. WE

ALSO DEPEND ON OUR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY ASSOCIATES FOR OUR

SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT

OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES

AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING

MATTERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS

WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR

BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT,

INVENTORIES, LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND

LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE

ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR

THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS,

ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED

OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INCREASED

COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET

SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND

ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A

NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING

AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH

RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES,

LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS,

WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER

RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES

OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN

PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALERS

AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER

BASES. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR

COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND

TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND

OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE

INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT

PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER,

EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS

INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR

REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY,

DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION

AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

THE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND

PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, AND A SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY

BREACH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE PROTECTION OF OUR CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND COMPANY DATA IS

IMPORTANT TO US. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO

INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH

NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE A HIGH EXPECTATION

THAT WE WILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. A

SIGNIFICANT BREACH OF CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE OR COMPANY DATA COULD

DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, FINES AND

LAWSUITS.

ANY

INABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ON SCHEDULE WILL DELAY THE

CONTRIBUTION OF THESE NEW STORES TO OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN CERTAIN EXISTING MARKETS

AND ENTER NEW MARKETS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES WILL

DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE

LOCATIONS, NEGOTIATE LEASES OR REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, ATTRACT AND TRAIN QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, AND MANAGE PRE-OPENING EXPENSES, INCLUDING

CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LOCAL ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER LAWS

RELATED TO LAND USE AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS

WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN STORES ON SCHEDULE, WHICH WILL

DELAY THE IMPACT OF THESE NEW STORES ON OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE

CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES AND THE OPENING OF NEW STORES. OUR ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS

AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN

EXPANDING OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, INTERNATIONAL

EXPANSION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY

AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND

CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS THE

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), LEGAL AND

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE

CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS

INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS,

THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS,

ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FCPA AND

LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON

OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INFORMAL REQUEST FROM

THE STAFF OF THE SEC FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS

RETURN-TO-VENDOR

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. SUBSEQUENT TO AUGUST 2005, THE SEC

STAFF REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SUCH POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES. THE SEC STAFF LAST CONTACTED THE COMPANY

REGARDING THIS MATTER IN JANUARY 2007. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO

THE REQUESTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC

STAFF. THE SEC HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMAL

INQUIRY IS NOT AN INDICATION THAT ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAW HAVE

OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS INFORMAL INQUIRY WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE SEC INFORMED THE COMPANY ON DECEMBER 10, 2008 THAT IT

DOES NOT INTEND TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON ITS INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO

THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES, WHICH

INQUIRY COMMENCED IN JUNE 2006. THE OFFICE OF THE

U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALSO

REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT IN 2006. THE COMPANY

RESPONDED TO EACH REQUEST AND OTHERWISE COOPERATED WITH THE SEC

AND THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY, INCLUDING PRODUCING

DOCUMENTS TO THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY IN LATE 2006.

THE SEC MATTER IS THEREFORE NOW CLOSED, AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED

ANY COMMUNICATION FROM THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY

SINCE THAT TIME.

ON OCTOBER 8, 2008, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF CLASS ACTIONS FILED

AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA, ALLEGING CERTAIN

MISREPRESENTATIONS IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A)

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND

RULE 10B-5

THEREUNDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS

RETURN-TO-VENDOR

PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE FILED BY CERTAIN CURRENT AND

FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2006. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT INCLUDED

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

DISPOSITION OF THESE MATTERS IS NOW COMPLETE.

THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO SETTLE DERIVATIVE AND SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 SECTION 14(A) CLAIMS FILED AGAINST IT

AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

RELATING TO THE COMPANYS

RETURN-TO-VENDOR,

STOCK OPTION GRANTING AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THE CLAIMS

WERE FILED BY CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY FROM THE

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2007. RELIEF SOUGHT INCLUDED, AMONG OTHERS, UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, BENEFITS

AND COMPENSATION OBTAINED BY THE DEFENDANTS, CANCELLATION OF A

NEW STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND AWARDS GRANTED UNDER SUCH PLAN,

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES. UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO MAINTAIN OR ADOPT

CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND TO PAY

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL ATTORNEYS FEES AND REIMBURSEMENT

OF EXPENSES IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $14.5 MILLION. THE

SETTLEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY,

GEORGIA, ON JUNE 10, 2008. THE DERIVATIVE AND

SECTION 14(A) ACTIONS WERE DISMISSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

SETTLEMENT, AND THE DISPOSITION OF THESE MATTERS IS NOW COMPLETE.

THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND,

IN SOME CASES, AGAINST CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

CANNOT PREDICT THEIR OUTCOME, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ACTIONS,

INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, THREE

PURPORTED, BUT UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY, THE HOME DEPOT FUTUREBUILDER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN

ATLANTA. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, THE PLAINTIFFS

JOINED TOGETHER IN ONE CASE AND VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THE OTHER

TWO CASES. IN MARCH 2007, THE THREE ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS AND TWO

ADDITIONAL FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED A JOINT AMENDED COMPLAINT

APPROVAL, WITH THE PLAINTIFFS IN FIVE CURRENT LAWSUITS IN THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN CALIFORNIA,

CONTAINING MULTIPLE

DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR BOTH. FINAL CLASS OR

COLLECTIVE-ACTION CERTIFICATION HAS YET TO BE ADDRESSED IN MOST

OF THESE CASES. THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE

POSSIBLE LOSS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM THESE LAWSUITS. THESE

MATTERS, IF DECIDED ADVERSELY TO OR SETTLED BY THE COMPANY,

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITSELF AGAINST

THESE ACTIONS.

IN JULY 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM

SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

DATA

FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL

2008), WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF $2.3 BILLION AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.34 COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS OF

$4.4 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.37 FOR

FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008 (FISCAL

2007).

WE TOOK ACTION ON SEVERAL STRATEGIC ITEMS IN FISCAL 2008

RESULTING IN TOTAL PRETAX CHARGES OF $951 MILLION

(RATIONALIZATION CHARGES). THESE RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES INCLUDED THE CLOSING OF 15 UNDERPERFORMING STORES AND

THE REMOVAL OF APPROXIMATELY 50 STORES FROM OUR NEW STORE

OPENING PIPELINE, THE PLANNED EXIT OF OUR EXPO, THD DESIGN

CENTER, YARDBIRDS AND HD BATH BUSINESSES AND STRATEGIC SUPPORT

STAFF REDUCTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2008 INCLUDED A

$163 MILLION PRETAX WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT IN HD

SUPPLY AND A $52 MILLION LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,

NET OF TAX, FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL FROM THE SALE

OF HD SUPPLY.

FISCAL 2008 CONSISTED OF 52 WEEKS COMPARED WITH

53 WEEKS FOR FISCAL 2007. THE

53

RD

WEEK

ADDED APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION IN NET SALES AND INCREASED

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY

APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR FISCAL 2007.

WE REPORTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF

$2.3 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS OF $1.37 FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $4.2 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.27 FOR FISCAL 2007.

EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY, EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

WERE $3.0 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.78 FOR FISCAL 2008.

NET SALES DECREASED 7.8% TO $71.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008

FROM $77.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE

53

RD

WEEK

OF FISCAL 2007, NET SALES DECREASED 6.5% FOR FISCAL 2008. THE

SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WEAKNESS IN THE

U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008. OUR

COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINED 8.7% IN FISCAL 2008 DRIVEN BY A

5.5% DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL

AS A 3.3% DECLINE IN OUR AVERAGE TICKET.

IN FISCAL 2008, DESPITE THE CONTINUING DIFFICULT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE RETAIL BUSINESS,

INVESTING IN OUR ASSOCIATES AND STORES AND IMPROVING OUR

CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE EXITED NON-CORE BUSINESSES,

RESTRUCTURED SUPPORT STAFF AND HAVE STOPPED APPLYING SIGNIFICANT

CAPITAL TO BUILDING NEW SQUARE FOOTAGE. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO

THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF OUR BUSINESS THROUGH OUR STRATEGY OF

INVESTING IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE

PRIORITIES.

ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT  WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF

ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT BY CHANGING THE WAY OUR

ASSOCIATES ARE COMPENSATED, RECOGNIZED AND REWARDED, INCLUDING

ENHANCING OUR SUCCESS SHARING PROGRAM, AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR

OUR HOURLY ASSOCIATES DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUAL STORE PERFORMANCE.

SUCCESS SHARING PAYOUTS WILL BE RECEIVED BY 83% OF OUR STORES

FOR THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 44% OF STORES FOR

THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

PRODUCT EXCITEMENT  WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR

MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION BY REDEFINING HOW WE RUN OUR

BUSINESS, IMPLEMENTING A FOCUSED BAY PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO

PRODUCT ASSORTMENT AND CREATING NEW TOOLS TO SUPPORT BETTER

MERCHANDISING DECISION MAKING. AS A RESULT, WE SAW CONSUMER UNIT

SHARE GAINS AGAINST THE MARKET IN SEVERAL KEY MERCHANDISING

CLASSES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARPET, HAND TOOLS, POWER TOOLS, BLINDS,

BATH FIXTURES, WINDOWS AND DOORS ALL GAINED SHARE IN FISCAL

2008. OUR NEW LOWER PRICE CAMPAIGN IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR

PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. AN EXAMPLE IS INTERIOR PAINT, WHERE WE HAVE

LOWERED PRICES ON ITEMS SUCH AS BEHR FLAT PREMIUM PLUS. UNIT

SALES ARE INCREASING, AND AT THE SAME TIME, OUR ATTACHMENT SALES

OF RELATED ITEMS ARE GOING UP.

SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT  WE CONTINUED OUR STORE

REINVESTMENT BY COMPLETING AN AGGRESSIVE LIST OF MAINTENANCE

PROJECTS, INCLUDING THE COMPLETION OF OUR LIGHTING UPGRADE, AS

WELL AS MORE COMPLEX REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES FOR

HUNDREDS OF OTHER STORES. IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMMATIC

MAINTENANCE, OUR INTEGRATED FIELD AND SUPPORT CENTER TEAMS HAVE

ROLLED OUT STORE STANDARDS TO ALL STORES. WE DEVELOPED AND

PILOTED COMMON GUIDELINES ON STORE APPEARANCE AND SHOPABILITY,

INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR FRONT APRON MERCHANDISING, WINGSTACK

USAGE, SIGNAGE PRESENTATION, FIXTURING AND OFF-SHELF PRODUCT.

THIS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INITIATIVE HELPS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME OUR STORE MANAGERS

SPEND ON THESE ISSUES, REMOVES UNNECESSARY CLUTTER FROM THE

AISLES AND IMPLEMENTS A BASIC AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO STORE

APPEARANCE.

PRODUCT AVAILABILITY  WE CONTINUED OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

TRANSFORMATION TO IMPROVE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. WE HAVE FIVE

RDCS OPERATING THAT NOW SERVE APPROXIMATELY 500 OF OUR STORES.

WE PLAN TO OPEN ADDITIONAL RDCS IN FISCAL 2009 AND EXPECT THAT

THEY WILL SERVE APPROXIMATELY 1,000 OF OUR STORES BY THE END OF

FISCAL 2009. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OUR OVERALL ROLL-OUT

STRATEGY FOR RDCS, SUPPORTING OUR GOAL OF INCREASING OUR CENTRAL

DISTRIBUTION PENETRATION.

OWN THE PRO  WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN

THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE OUR PRO CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH

OUR PRO BID ROOM. THE PRO BID ROOM, WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN ALL OF

OUR STORES, ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE THE BUYING POWER OF THE HOME

DEPOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PRO CUSTOMERS. OUR DIRECT SHIP

PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO HAVE LARGE ORDERS DELIVERED FROM OUR

VENDORS TO THE CUSTOMERS JOB SITE DIRECTLY, REDUCING

HANDLING, LEAD-TIME AND COST WHILE BUILDING LOYALTY WITH THE PRO

CUSTOMER.

WE OPENED 62 NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2008, INCLUDING 6 RELOCATIONS,

CLOSED 15 STORES AS PART OF OUR STORE RATIONALIZATION ACTIONS

AND CLOSED ONE STORE IN MEXICO DUE TO A FIRE, BRINGING OUR TOTAL

STORE COUNT AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008 TO 2,274. AS OF THE END OF

FISCAL 2008, 262, OR APPROXIMATELY 12%, OF OUR STORES WERE

LOCATED IN CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA COMPARED TO 243 AS OF FISCAL

2007.

WE GENERATED $5.5 BILLION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN

FISCAL 2008. WE USED THIS CASH FLOW TO REPAY $2.0 BILLION

OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS, FUND

$1.8 BILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PAY

$1.5 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO

WAS 54.4% COMPARED TO 64.3% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007. OUR

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS (COMPUTED

ON THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY

FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS) WAS 9.5% AT THE END OF FISCAL

2008 COMPARED TO 13.9% FOR FISCAL 2007. THIS DECREASE REFLECTS

THE DECLINE IN OUR OPERATING PROFIT, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT

OF THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. EXCLUDING RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES, OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR CONTINUING

OPERATIONS WAS 11.4%.

FISCAL

2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

NET

SALES

FISCAL 2008 CONSISTED OF 52 WEEKS COMPARED TO 53 WEEKS

IN FISCAL 2007. NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 DECREASED 7.8% TO

$71.3 BILLION FROM $77.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. THE

DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF

NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND $1.1 BILLION OF NET

SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN FISCAL 2007,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET SALES OF $1.8 BILLION FROM NEW

STORES IN FISCAL 2008. COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 8.7% FOR

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF 6.7% FOR FISCAL 2007.

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR

COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL

CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT

AND CONSUMERS WERE CHALLENGED DUE TO HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT AND AN

ACROSS-THE-BOARD TIGHTENING OF CONSUMER CREDIT AVAILABILITY. WE

SAW RELATIVE STRENGTH IN BUILDING MATERIALS, PLUMBING,

GARDEN/SEASONAL AND HARDWARE AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN THESE

AREAS WERE ABOVE OR AT THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2008.

COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR LUMBER, FLOORING, PAINT, ELECTRICAL,

KITCHEN/BATH AND MILLWORK WERE BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR

FISCAL 2008. SOFTNESS IN OUR BIG TICKET CATEGORIES NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED AVERAGE TICKET, WHICH DECREASED 3.3% TO $55.61 FOR

FISCAL 2008.

IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE OBJECTIVES, WE

STRATEGICALLY OPEN STORES NEAR MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING

STORES (CANNIBALIZE) TO ENHANCE SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN

INCREMENTAL SALES AND INCREASE MARKET PENETRATION. OUR NEW

STORES CANNIBALIZED APPROXIMATELY 5% OF OUR EXISTING STORES AS

OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008, WHICH HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO

COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 1%.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SALES PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN, AND COULD

CONTINUE TO BE, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION

THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS MARKETS. DUE TO THE

HIGHLY-FRAGMENTED U.S. HOME IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY, IN WHICH

WE ESTIMATE OUR MARKET SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY 20%, MEASURING THE

IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS IS DIFFICULT.

GROSS

PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 7.7% TO $24.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2008 FROM $26.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. GROSS PROFIT AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 33.7% FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 33.6%

FOR FISCAL 2007, AN INCREASE OF FOUR BASIS POINTS. THIS GROSS

MARGIN EXPANSION INCLUDED $30 MILLION IN MARKDOWNS TAKEN IN

CONNECTION WITH OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. EXCLUDING THESE

MARKDOWNS, OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED

EIGHT BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2008, REFLECTING OUR FOCUSED BAY

PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO PRODUCT ASSORTMENT.

OPERATING

EXPENSES

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

(SG&A) INCREASED 4.7% TO $17.8 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2008 FROM $17.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 25.0% FOR FISCAL 2008

COMPARED TO 22.1% FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION

CHARGES, SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS

23.7%, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 170 BASIS POINTS OVER

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF EXPENSE

DELEVERAGE IN THE NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES ENVIRONMENT,

AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 70 BASIS POINTS DUE

TO A HIGHER COST OF CREDIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIVATE LABEL

CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. FOR FISCAL 2008, THE PENETRATION OF THE

PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES WAS 28.1% COMPARED TO 29.4% FOR

FISCAL 2007.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 4.9% TO

$1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM $1.7 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2007. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES WAS 2.5% FOR FISCAL 2008 AND 2.2% FOR FISCAL 2007. THE

INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES

DELEVERAGE AND THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN SHORTER

LIVED ASSETS SUCH AS STORE RESETS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING

INCOME

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 39.8% TO $4.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2008 FROM $7.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. OPERATING INCOME AS

A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 6.1% FOR FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 9.4%

FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES,

OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 7.4% FOR FISCAL

2008.

INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET

IN FISCAL 2008, WE RECOGNIZED $769 MILLION OF INTEREST AND

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.1% FOR

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO 0.8% FOR FISCAL 2007. INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET, REFLECTS A $163 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-DOWN

OUR INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY. EXCLUDING THIS CHARGE, INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.9% FOR FISCAL 2008.

PROVISION

FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DECREASED TO 35.6% FOR FISCAL 2008 FROM 36.4% FOR FISCAL 2007.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2008

REFLECTS LOWER STATE AND FOREIGN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES.

DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.37

FOR FISCAL 2008 AND $2.27 FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING THE

RATIONALIZATION CHARGES AND THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT IN

HD SUPPLY, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

FOR FISCAL 2008 WERE $1.78, A DECREASE OF 21.6% FROM FISCAL

2007. THE

53

RD

WEEK

IN FISCAL 2007 INCREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR FISCAL 2007.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE

FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON

STOCK. WE REPURCHASED 2.4 MILLION SHARES FOR

$70 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008 AND 293 MILLION SHARES FOR

$10.8 BILLION IN FISCAL 2007. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 746 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $27.3 BILLION.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD

SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2008 CONSIST OF A

LOSS OF $52 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.03 PER DILUTED

SHARE, RECORDED TO SETTLE NET WORKING CAPITAL MATTERS ARISING

FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL

2007 CONSIST OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR HD SUPPLY THROUGH

AUGUST 30, 2007 AND A $4 MILLION LOSS ON THE SALE OF

HD SUPPLY. NET SALES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE

$7.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 AND EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, WERE $185 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007.

FISCAL 2007 CONSISTED OF 53 WEEKS COMPARED TO 52 WEEKS

IN FISCAL 2006. NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2007 DECREASED 2.1%, OR

$1.7 BILLION, TO $77.3 BILLION FROM $79.0 BILLION

FOR FISCAL 2006. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2007

REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET SALES OF $3.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2007 FROM NEW STORES AND $1.1 BILLION OF NET SALES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN FISCAL 2007. COMPARABLE

STORE SALES DECREASED 6.7% FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO A

DECREASE OF 2.8% FOR FISCAL 2006.

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR

COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND

HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT, ESPECIALLY IN

SOME OF OUR TRADITIONALLY STRONG MARKETS SUCH AS FLORIDA,

CALIFORNIA AND THE NORTHEAST. THE COMBINATION OF SOFTNESS IN OUR

BIG TICKET CATEGORIES AND COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED AVERAGE TICKET, WHICH DECREASED 2.4% TO $57.48 FOR

FISCAL 2007. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PERFORMED WELL IN FISCAL

2007. OUR MEXICAN STORES POSTED A DOUBLE DIGIT COMPARABLE STORE

SALES INCREASE FOR FISCAL 2007, AND CANADAS COMPARABLE

STORE SALES WERE ALSO POSITIVE. OUR NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED

APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR EXISTING STORES AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2007, WHICH HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF

APPROXIMATELY 1%.

GROSS

PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 2.1% TO $26.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2007 FROM $26.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. GROSS PROFIT AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 33.6% FOR FISCAL 2007, FLAT COMPARED TO

FISCAL 2006. LOWER DEFERRED INTEREST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD FINANCING PROGRAMS PROVIDED A BENEFIT

OF 39 BASIS POINTS TO GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES FOR FISCAL 2007. THE DEFERRED INTEREST BENEFIT WAS MOSTLY

OFFSET BY A HIGHER PENETRATION OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS SUCH AS

APPLIANCES AND MARKDOWNS TAKEN TO CLEAR THROUGH SOME SEASONAL

ITEMS, SUCH AS OUTDOOR POWER EQUIPMENT AND GRILLS, AND TO ALLOW

US TO TRANSITION INTO NEW PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ASSEMBLED CABINETS

AND KITCHEN ACCESSORIES.

OPERATING

EXPENSES

SG&A INCREASED 5.9% TO $17.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007

FROM $16.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES, SG&A WAS 22.1% FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 20.4% FOR

FISCAL 2006. IN FISCAL 2007, OUR PROFIT SHARING WITH THE

THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIO WAS $275 MILLION LESS THAN WHAT WE RECEIVED IN

FISCAL 2006. WE ALSO RECOGNIZED $88 MILLION OF WRITE-OFFS

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FUTURE STORE LOCATIONS THAT WE

DETERMINED WE WILL NOT OPEN AND $34 MILLION OF EXPENSE

ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING OUR 11 HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY

STORES AND OUR TAMPA CALL CENTER IN FISCAL 2007. SG&A ALSO

REFLECTS INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN SUPPORT OF OUR FIVE KEY

PRIORITIES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, TOTAL PAYROLL

INCREASED BY 76 BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2007 OVER FISCAL

2006. THIS REFLECTS INVESTMENTS IN STORE LABOR AND OUR MASTER

TRADE SPECIALISTS PROGRAM, THE IMPACT OF OUR SUCCESS SHARING

BONUS PLANS, AS WELL AS THE NEGATIVE SALES ENVIRONMENT. THE

INCREASE IN SG&A FOR FISCAL 2007 OVER FISCAL 2006 WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $129 MILLION OF EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE

RECORDED IN FISCAL 2006.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 8.1% TO

$1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $1.6 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2006. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES WAS 2.2% FOR FISCAL 2007 AND 2.0% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE

INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

DEPRECIATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND

TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 18.3% TO $7.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL

IN FISCAL 2007, WE RECOGNIZED $622 MILLION OF

NET INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO $364 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2006. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS

0.8% FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 0.5% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCURRED

RELATED TO THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION OF

FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES, $1.25 BILLION OF

5.25% SENIOR NOTES AND $3.0 BILLION OF

5.875% SENIOR NOTES.

PROVISION

FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DECREASED TO 36.4% FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM 38.1% FOR FISCAL 2006.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2007

REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF A ONE-TIME RETROACTIVE TAX ASSESSMENT

RECEIVED FROM THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 AND TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED UPON

SETTLEMENT OF SEVERAL STATE AUDITS AND COMPLETION OF THE FISCAL

2003 AND 2004 FEDERAL TAX AUDITS IN FISCAL 2007.

DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.27

FOR FISCAL 2007 AND $2.55 FOR FISCAL 2006. THE

53

RD

WEEK

INCREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR FISCAL 2007. DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN BOTH

FISCAL 2007 AND 2006 BY THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON

STOCK.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONSIST OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR

HD SUPPLY THROUGH AUGUST 30, 2007 AND A LOSS ON THE SALE OF

HD SUPPLY. NET SALES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE

$7.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO $11.8 BILLION

FOR FISCAL 2006. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF

TAX, WERE $185 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, COMPARED TO

$495 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2007 INCLUDE A $4 MILLION LOSS, NET

OF TAX, RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS.

LIQUIDITY

AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT

SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2008, NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $5.5 BILLION COMPARED TO

$5.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY A

RESULT OF DECREASED NET EARNINGS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS

$1.7 BILLION COMPARED TO $4.8 BILLION PROVIDED BY

INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2007. THE CHANGE IN NET CASH

USED IN/PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF $8.3 BILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF HD

SUPPLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$1.7 BILLION LESS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2008

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007.

IN FISCAL 2008, WE SPENT $1.8 BILLION ON CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: 45% FOR NEW STORES, 15% FOR

MERCHANDISING AND OPERATIONS, 12% FOR MAINTENANCE, 11% FOR CORE

TECHNOLOGY AND 17% FOR OTHER INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2008, WE

ADDED 62 NEW STORES, INCLUDING SIX RELOCATIONS.

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS

$3.7 BILLION COMPARED WITH $10.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2007. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPURCHASE OF 289 MILLION SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $10.7 BILLION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

TENDER OFFER RELATED TO THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 AND BY REPAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2008 OF

$1.7 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AND

$282 MILLION OF STRUCTURED FINANCING DEBT.

WE REPURCHASED 2.4 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR

$70 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008 AND A TOTAL OF 293 MILLION

SHARES FOR $10.8 BILLION IN FISCAL 2007, INCLUDING A

$10.7 BILLION TENDER OFFER FUNDED PRIMARILY USING PROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 746 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $27.3 BILLION. AS

OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009, $12.7 BILLION REMAINED UNDER OUR

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. GIVEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS,

WE HAVE SUSPENDED THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM UNTIL OUR BUSINESS AND

CREDIT MARKETS STABILIZE.

WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP

TO $3.25 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE

A

BACK-UP

CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO

$3.25 BILLION. AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009, THERE WERE NO

BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS OR

THE RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES

IN DECEMBER 2010, CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, ALL OF

WHICH WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE. NONE OF THE COVENANTS ARE EXPECTED

TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR

REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND

STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE

OBLIGATIONS IS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN

LONG-TERM DEBT AND CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE

OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008, OUR LONG-TERM

DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 54.4% COMPARED TO 64.3% AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2007.

AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009, WE HAD $525 MILLION IN CASH

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH

POSITION, ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND CASH FLOW

GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO

COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND REQUIRED LONG-TERM

DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER

PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF

FINANCING FOR OTHER REQUIREMENTS. WE INTEND TO USE CASH FLOW

GENERATED BY OPERATIONS TO REPAY $1.8 BILLION IN DEBT

COMING DUE IN FISCAL 2009.

DURING FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

OF $3.0 BILLION, THAT SWAPPED FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR

$3.0 BILLION 5.40% SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE RATE

INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 60 TO 149 BASIS POINTS. IN

FISCAL 2008, WE RECEIVED $56 MILLION TO SETTLE THESE SWAPS,

WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO REDUCE INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE DEBT.

AT FEBRUARY 1, 2009, WE HAD OUTSTANDING AN INTEREST RATE

SWAP, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF $750 MILLION THAT SWAPS VARIABLE RATE INTEREST ON OUR

$750 MILLION FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES FOR FIXED RATE

INTEREST AT 4.36% THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 16, 2009. AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2009, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THIS

AGREEMENT WAS A LIABILITY OF $21 MILLION, WHICH IS THE

ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE PAID TO SETTLE THIS INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS

IN INTEREST RATES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING

ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS

NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES, AS WELL

AS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE

DEBT.

AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009 WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS,

$11.0 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE MARKET

VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2009, WERE APPROXIMATELY $10.0 BILLION.

IMPACT OF

INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR

PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT

PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INFLATION AND

DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND

DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT

THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR

RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS

BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE

RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR

ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE

ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES

COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM

CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE

MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT

RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS

COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT

CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT

CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

(FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 82% VALUED UNDER THE

RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD.

RETAILERS LIKE THE HOME DEPOT, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF

MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS,

FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL

INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST,

WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE

ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL

VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR

INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER

OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER A COST

METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED

AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT

MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END

OF FISCAL 2008 OR 2007.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN

ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO

ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY

STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN

OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON

A

STORE-BY-STORE

BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY,

SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT

OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO

THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR

DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK

AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM

THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE

EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS

AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID

NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007

OR 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SELF-INSURANCE

WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL

LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITY REPRESENTS AN

ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE

BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED

AND IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND

ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND

THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE

LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE

REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF

ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS,

MEDICAL COST INFLATION, OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM

OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY

MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 OR 2006.

VENDOR

ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE

EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND

ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS

PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS

WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN

PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED,

WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN

PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON

ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR

ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE

INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE

ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE

INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND

A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT

IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE

REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS

INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN

OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN

MANAGEMENT MAKES THE DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR

OTHER LOCATION, OR WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. A STORES ASSETS

ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER

THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, A PROVISION IS MADE TO WRITE

DOWN THE RELATED ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS

GREATER THAN THE FAIR VALUE. WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON

THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER

FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A

LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT

VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE

INCOME.

IN FISCAL 2008, WE RECORDED $580 MILLION OF ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS AS

PART OF OUR RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. SEE NOTE 2 FOR MORE

DETAILS ON THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. WE ALSO RECORDED

IMPAIRMENTS ON THE OTHER CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM

IS DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT

INC.S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK

THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS,

CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE

COMPANY) OPERATE THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE

FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY

105,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY

30,000 TO 40,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME

IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD

TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS, HOME

IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS, TRADESPEOPLE AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE

PROFESSIONALS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY WAS

OPERATING 2,274 STORES, WHICH INCLUDED 1,971 THE HOME DEPOT

STORES, 34 EXPO STORES, FIVE YARDBIRDS STORES AND TWO THD DESIGN

CENTER STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE COMMONWEALTH

OF PUERTO RICO AND THE TERRITORIES OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS

AND GUAM (U.S.), 176 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN

CANADA, 74 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN MEXICO AND 12 THE HOME DEPOT

STORES IN CHINA. ON JANUARY 26, 2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

PLANS TO CLOSE THE EXPO, THD DESIGN CENTER AND YARDBIRDS STORES

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS FOCUS ON ITS CORE BUSINESS. THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL

YEAR

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING

ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31. FISCAL YEAR ENDED

FEBRUARY 1, 2009 (FISCAL 2008) INCLUDES

52 WEEKS, FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008

(FISCAL 2007) INCLUDES 53 WEEKS AND FISCAL YEAR

ENDED JANUARY 28, 2007 (FISCAL 2006) INCLUDES

52 WEEKS.

USE OF

ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES,

SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE

TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IS DISCUSSED UNDER

THE CAPTION SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN THIS

NOTE 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT

IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6.

CASH

EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED

WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH

EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANYS CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT

FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HIGH-GRADE COMMERCIAL

PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY

SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON

CURRENT MARKET RATES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER

WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE

COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE

RELATED RECEIVABLES. WE EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES

HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT

THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THE

AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER EXPIRES IN 2018,

WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO

PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE

DEFERRED

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED

FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN COST

OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE CARDS AND THE PROFIT SHARING WITH THE

THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A). THE SUM OF THE

THREE IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY AS THE COST OF

CREDIT OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT

DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE

RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $37 MILLION AND

$57 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009 AND

FEBRUARY 3, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS

VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT

MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY

AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008 OR 2007.

MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE

STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

(FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY

METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO

REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL

METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA, MEXICO AND

CHINA, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD.

THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 18% OF THE

TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE

INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER

TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A

COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008 OR 2007.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN

ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO

ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY

STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN

STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO

SHRINK ON A

STORE-BY-STORE

BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN

THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY,

SWELL) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT

OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO

THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR

DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES

CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. FEDERAL, STATE AND

FOREIGN TAX BENEFITS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME

TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR

THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED

INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE

YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES

IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES

THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO

PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES FOR THESE

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANYS BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

33

COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS

TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN

PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE

GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST FOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VENDOR

ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE

EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND

ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS

PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS

WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN

PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED,

WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN

PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON

ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED

ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED

PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE

REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS

INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN

OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND

2006, GROSS ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.0 BILLION,

$1.2 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS

RECORDED IN SG&A. SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE

ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES WERE $107 MILLION,

$120 MILLION AND $83 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO

ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

COST OF

SALES

COST OF SALES INCLUDES THE ACTUAL COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD AND

SERVICES PERFORMED, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE

FROM VENDORS TO THE COMPANYS STORES, LOCATIONS OR

CUSTOMERS, THE OPERATING COST OF THE COMPANYS SOURCING AND

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS

OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANYS PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD

PROGRAM.

THE COST OF HANDLING AND SHIPPING MERCHANDISE FROM THE

COMPANYS STORES, LOCATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE

CUSTOMER IS CLASSIFIED AS SG&A. THE COST OF SHIPPING AND

HANDLING, INCLUDING INTERNAL COSTS AND PAYMENTS TO THIRD

PARTIES, CLASSIFIED AS SG&A WAS $501 MILLION,

$571 MILLION AND $545 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR

VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE

GOODWILL, BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS

WERE ESTIMATED USING THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER

THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE FROM 1 TO

20 YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED

NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 OR 2006.

IMPAIRMENT

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WHEN MANAGEMENT MAKES THE DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE

OR OTHER LOCATION, OR WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. A STORES ASSETS

ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER

THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, A PROVISION IS MADE TO WRITE

DOWN THE RELATED ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS

GREATER THAN THE FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A

COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO

RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE

OBLIGATIONS, LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

IN FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED $580 MILLION OF ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND $252 MILLION OF LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS AS

PART OF ITS RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. SEE NOTE 2 FOR MORE

DETAILS ON THE RATIONALIZATION CHARGES. THE COMPANY ALSO

RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS ON THE OTHER CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A NEW ENTERPRISE

RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM, INCLUDING A NEW

INVENTORY SYSTEM, FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS IN CANADA. ALONG

WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES FOR ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS

IN CANADA FROM THE LOWER OF COST

(FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY

METHOD, TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET USING A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

COST METHOD. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM AND RELATED CONVERSION TO THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD FOR CANADIAN RETAIL OPERATIONS WAS

COMPLETE.

THE NEW ERP SYSTEM ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO UTILIZE THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL

RESULT IN GREATER PRECISION IN THE COSTING OF INVENTORIES AND A

BETTER MATCHING OF COST OF SALES WITH REVENUE GENERATED. THE

EFFECT OF THE CHANGE ON THE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND RETAINED

EARNINGS BALANCES WAS NOT MATERIAL. PRIOR TO THE INVENTORY

SYSTEM CONVERSION, THE COMPANY COULD NOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF

THE CHANGE TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD AND THEREFORE,

COULD NOT RETROACTIVELY APPLY THE CHANGE TO PERIODS PRIOR TO

FISCAL 2008.

$163 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-DOWN THE INVESTMENT, WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, THE COMPANY GUARANTEED A

$1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED LOAN (GUARANTEED

AS A LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES. THE GUARANTEED LOAN HAS A TERM OF FIVE YEARS AND

THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO $1.0 BILLION AND ANY

UNPAID INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF NON-PAYMENT BY HD SUPPLY. THE

STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108

IN FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN NO. 108, CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF

PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108). SAB 108 ADDRESSES THE PROCESS

OF QUANTIFYING PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS AND

THEIR IMPACT ON CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

PROVISIONS OF SAB 108 ALLOWED COMPANIES TO REPORT THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CORRECTING IMMATERIAL PRIOR YEAR

MISSTATEMENTS, BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL METHOD FOR

EVALUATING MISSTATEMENTS, BY ADJUSTING THE OPENING BALANCE OF

RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION RATHER THAN AMENDING PREVIOUSLY FILED REPORTS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SAB 108, THE COMPANY ADJUSTED BEGINNING

RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE ITEMS DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ANY OF THE PRIOR YEARS AFFECTED.

HISTORICAL

STOCK OPTION PRACTICES

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REQUESTED THAT ITS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS REVIEW ITS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES.

A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNDERTOOK THE REVIEW WITH

THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL, AND IT HAS

COMPLETED ITS REVIEW. THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF THE 2006 REVIEW

WERE AS FOLLOWS.



ALL OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE PERIOD FROM 2002 THROUGH THE PRESENT

HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE

COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE THE GRANT WAS APPROVED BY THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AN OFFICER ACTING PURSUANT TO DELEGATED

AUTHORITY. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION

DEPARTMENT CORRECTED

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY AND WITHOUT SEPARATE

APPROVALS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS INCLUDED INADVERTENT

OMISSIONS OF GRANTEES FROM LISTS THAT WERE APPROVED PREVIOUSLY

AND MISCALCULATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO

PARTICULAR EMPLOYEES ON APPROVED LISTS.



ALL OPTIONS GRANTED FROM DECEMBER 1, 2000 THROUGH THE END

OF 2001 HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE

COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF A MEETING OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OR SOME OTHER DATE SELECTED WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF

HINDSIGHT. THE FEBRUARY 2001 ANNUAL GRANT WAS NOT FINALLY

ALLOCATED TO RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE GRANT WAS

APPROVED. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION

DEPARTMENT ALSO CORRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY

AND WITHOUT SEPARATE APPROVALS AS IN THE PERIOD 2002 TO THE

PRESENT.



FOR ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS AND CERTAIN QUARTERLY OPTION GRANTS

FROM 1981 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2000, THE STATED GRANT DATE WAS

ROUTINELY EARLIER THAN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH THE GRANTS WERE

APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ALMOST

EVERY INSTANCE, THE STOCK PRICE ON THE APPARENT APPROVAL DATE

WAS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE ON THE STATED GRANT DATE. THE

BACKDATING OCCURRED FOR GRANTS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE COMPANY.

MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE SINCE LEFT THE COMPANY, GENERALLY

FOLLOWED A PRACTICE OF REVIEWING CLOSING PRICES FOR A PRIOR

PERIOD AND SELECTING A DATE WITH A LOW STOCK PRICE TO INCREASE

THE VALUE OF THE OPTIONS TO EMPLOYEES ON LISTS OF GRANTEES

SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.



THE ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS IN 1994 THROUGH 2000, AS WELL AS MANY

QUARTERLY GRANTS DURING THIS PERIOD, WERE NOT FINALLY ALLOCATED

AMONG THE RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE STATED GRANT

DATE. BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF RECORDS PRIOR TO 1994, IT IS

UNCLEAR WHETHER ALLOCATIONS ALSO POSTDATED THE SELECTED GRANT

DATES FROM 1981 THROUGH 1993. MOREOVER, FOR MANY OF THESE ANNUAL

AND QUARTERLY GRANTS FROM 1981 THROUGH DECEMBER 2000, THERE IS

INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN THE

GRANTS WERE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. FINALLY, THE COMPANYS STOCK ADMINISTRATION

DEPARTMENT ALSO RETROACTIVELY ADDED EMPLOYEES TO LISTS OF

APPROVED GRANTEES, OR CHANGED THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO

SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES, WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OR A BOARD COMMITTEE, TO CORRECT ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS.



NUMEROUS OPTION GRANTS TO

RANK-AND-FILE

EMPLOYEES WERE MADE PURSUANT TO DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY THAT

MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE UNDER DELAWARE LAW.



IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES, AND PRIMARILY PRIOR TO 2003,

BENEFICIARIES OF GRANTS WHO WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEM TO THE

SEC FAILED TO DO SO IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.



THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO INTENTIONAL

WRONGDOING BY ANY CURRENT MEMBER OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT TEAM OR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THESE ERRORS, IT HAD

UNRECORDED EXPENSE OVER THE AFFECTED PERIOD (1981 THROUGH

2005) OF $227 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING

RELATED TAX ITEMS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF

SAB 108, THE COMPANY DECREASED BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS

FOR FISCAL 2006 BY $227 MILLION WITHIN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE STAFF OF THE SEC BEGAN IN JUNE 2006

AN INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION

PRACTICES, AND THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALSO REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THE

SUBJECT. ON DECEMBER 10, 2008, THE SEC STATED IN A LETTER

TO THE COMPANY THAT IT DID NOT INTEND TO TAKE ANY ACTION AS A

RESULT OF THE INQUIRY. THE SEC MATTER IS THEREFORE NOW CLOSED,

AND THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY COMMUNICATION FROM THE

OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY SINCE 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT

IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS

AND, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO

VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

AT FEBRUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET

OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE

INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES FROM 2010 TO 2028. MANAGEMENT

HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX

BENEFITS RELATED TO THE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES ARE IN

JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE EXPIRATION PERIOD IS TOO SHORT TO BE

ASSURED OF UTILIZATION. THEREFORE, A $12 MILLION VALUATION

ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET

RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AT

FEBRUARY 1, 2009 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2008 WERE

$12 MILLION AND $7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS SALE OF HD SUPPLY, THE COMPANY INCURRED A TAX

LOSS, RESULTING IN A NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER OF APPROXIMATELY

$187 MILLION. THE TAX LOSS ON SALE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM

THE COMPANYS TAX BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS BOOK INVESTMENT IN

HD SUPPLY. THE NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL EXPIRE IF NOT

USED BY 2012. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL

LOSS CARRYOVER WILL BE REALIZED BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE

ADEQUATE CAPITAL GAIN INCOME DURING THE CARRYOVER PERIOD.

THEREFORE, NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

ON APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO

INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED

U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN

INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF

THIS LIABILITY.

ON JANUARY 29, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109 (FIN 48). AMONG OTHER

THINGS, FIN 48 REQUIRES APPLICATION OF A MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THRESHOLD TO THE RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION OF

TAX POSITIONS. IT FURTHER REQUIRES THAT A CHANGE IN JUDGMENT

RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS TAX POSITIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

QUARTER OF SUCH CHANGE. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 REDUCED THE

COMPANYS RETAINED EARNINGS BY $111 MILLION. AS A

RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION, THE GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS AT JANUARY 29, 2007 FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS

TOTALED $667 MILLION. A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND

ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CONTINUING

OPERATIONS IS AS FOLLOWS (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS).

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY DECREASED ITS INTEREST ACCRUAL

ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BY APPROXIMATELY

$19 MILLION AND PAID INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY

$12 MILLION. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

INTEREST ACCRUAL ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BY

APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION AND PAID INTEREST OF

APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION. TOTAL ACCRUED INTEREST AS OF

FEBRUARY 1, 2009 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2008 IS

$109 MILLION AND $140 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THERE

WERE NO PENALTY ACCRUALS DURING FISCAL 2008 OR 2007. INTEREST

AND PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OPERATING

EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CLASSIFICATION OF INTEREST AND

PENALTIES DID NOT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF

FIN 48.

THE COMPANYS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THESE AUDITS GENERALLY

INCLUDE QUERIES REGARDING THE COST RECOVERY OF CERTAIN ASSETS,

WHICH MAY RESULT IN TIMING DIFFERENCES. DURING 2007, THE IRS

COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL 2003 AND

2004 INCOME TAX RETURNS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN ISSUES

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER APPEAL. DURING 2008, THE IRS BEGAN ITS

EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005 AND 2006. THE CANADIAN

GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS PROVINCES, ARE CURRENTLY AUDITING

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2005. ALSO, DURING

2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT

WHICH SETTLED A TRANSFER PRICING ISSUE FOR THE YEARS 2004

THROUGH 2008 RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS PROVIDED FROM THE

U.S. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING U.S. STATE AND LOCAL

AUDITS COVERING TAX YEARS 2001 TO 2006. AT THIS TIME, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY INCOME TAX AUDIT TO

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS UNDER APPEAL FOR

THE COMPLETED IRS EXAMINATION, AS WELL AS CERTAIN STATE AUDITS,

WILL BE AGREED UPON WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE COMPANY

HAS CLASSIFIED APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION OF THE RESERVE FOR

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A SHORT-TERM LIABILITY IN THE

ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF

THESE AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS

THAN THESE AMOUNTS, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEASES

THE COMPANY LEASES CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFICE SPACE,

WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION SPACE, EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. WHILE

MOST OF THE LEASES ARE OPERATING LEASES, CERTAIN LOCATIONS AND

EQUIPMENT ARE LEASED UNDER CAPITAL LEASES. AS LEASES EXPIRE, IT

CAN BE EXPECTED THAT, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CERTAIN

LEASES WILL BE RENEWED OR REPLACED.

CERTAIN LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ESCALATING RENTS OVER THE LEASE

TERMS. THE COMPANY EXPENSES RENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THE LEASE TERM WHICH COMMENCES ON THE DATE THE COMPANY HAS THE

RIGHT TO CONTROL THE PROPERTY. THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE CUMULATIVE PAYMENTS IS

INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE COMPANY HAD A LEASE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY LEASED

CERTAIN ASSETS TOTALING $282 MILLION. THIS LEASE WAS

ORIGINALLY CREATED UNDER A STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND

INVOLVED TWO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY FINANCED A

PORTION OF ITS NEW STORES OPENED IN FISCAL YEARS 1997 THROUGH

2003 UNDER THIS LEASE AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE

LESSOR PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES, PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS

AND SUBSEQUENTLY LEASED THE FACILITIES TO THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY RECORDED THE RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS AS SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE $282 MILLION LEASE AGREEMENT EXPIRED IN FISCAL 2008,

AND THE COMPANY EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE THE ASSETS

UNDER THIS LEASE FOR $282 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THIS

PURCHASE, THE COMPANY PAID OFF $282 MILLION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT INCLUDED IN THE STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND

RECLASSIFIED $282 MILLION FROM LONG-TERM NOTES RECEIVABLE

TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

TOTAL RENT EXPENSE, NET OF MINOR SUBLEASE INCOME FOR FISCAL

2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $846 MILLION, $824 MILLION AND

$768 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN STORE LEASES ALSO

PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT RENT PAYMENTS BASED ON PERCENTAGES OF

SALES IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED MINIMUMS. CONTINGENT RENT EXPENSE

FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY

$5 MILLION, $6 MILLION AND $9 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, MAINTENANCE AND

OPERATING EXPENSES APPLICABLE TO THE LEASED PROPERTY ARE
