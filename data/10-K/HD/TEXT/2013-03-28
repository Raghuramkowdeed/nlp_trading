TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY

IN FISCAL

2012

, WE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING KEY INITIATIVES.

•

CUSTOMER SERVICE

. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF CREATING AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST, TAKING CARE OF OUR ASSOCIATES AND SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS. WE UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS INITIATIVE IN FISCAL 2012 BY RETRAINING ALL U.S. STORE ASSOCIATES ON OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST PROGRAM PRIOR TO THE SPRING SELLING SEASON. DURING FISCAL 2012, WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MADE CERTAIN STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS MORE EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS, WE HAVE CONTINUALLY IMPROVED OUR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY RESULTS. WE ALSO SOUGHT TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE WAGES AND INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR ASSOCIATES.

•

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

. OUR PRODUCT AUTHORITY INITIATIVE IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PRODUCT INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. IN FISCAL

2012

, WE INTRODUCED A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS TO OUR PROFESSIONAL AND DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON OFFERING EVERY DAY VALUES IN OUR STORES.

•

DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

. WE HAVE ADVANCED THIS INITIATIVE THROUGH BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLY CHAIN. DURING FISCAL

2012

, WE COMPLETED THE MECHANIZATION OF OUR RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTER ("RDC") NETWORK, AND WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OPERATING AND OPTIMIZING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK. WE ALSO ADVANCED THIS INITIATIVE THROUGH OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND EXPENSE CONTROL, WHICH DROVE HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ALLOWED US TO RETURN VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.

•

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL

. AS CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO BUY HOW, WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT, WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING A SEAMLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS, WITH AN EXPANDED ARRAY OF MERCHANDISE, WILL BE A KEY ENABLER FOR FUTURE SUCCESS. THE INTERCONNECTED RETAIL INITIATIVE IS WOVEN THROUGHOUT OUR BUSINESS AND CONNECTS OUR OTHER THREE KEY INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL

2012

, WE LAUNCHED SEVERAL PROJECTS TO SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE, STARTING IN THE FIRST QUARTER WITH THE ROLLOUT OF A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE TO OUR WEBSITE, WHICH ENHANCED THE LAYOUT, VISUAL APPEARANCE AND RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SITE. WE ALSO BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO SUPPORT DIRECT-TO-CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT, WITH A SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER ALSO UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND WE ADDED NEW CUSTOMER CALL CENTERS IN UTAH AND GEORGIA. LASTLY, WE INTRODUCED NEW PROGRAMS, SUCH AS BUY ONLINE, RETURN IN STORE ("BORIS") AND BUY ONLINE, SHIP TO STORE ("BOSS"), TO EXPAND UPON BUY ONLINE, PICK-UP IN STORE ("BOPIS"), WHICH WE INTRODUCED IN FISCAL 2011.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

OUR CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS, AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT CUSTOMER SERVICE APPROACHES TO MEET THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS.

•

DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. OUR ASSOCIATES ASSIST THESE CUSTOMERS WITH SPECIFIC PRODUCT AND INSTALLATION QUESTIONS BOTH IN OUR STORES AND THROUGH ONLINE RESOURCES AND OTHER MEDIA DESIGNED TO PROVIDE PRODUCT AND PROJECT KNOWLEDGE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF CLINICS AND WORKSHOPS BOTH TO IMPART THIS KNOWLEDGE AND TO BUILD AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS.

•

DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M") CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT OR INSTALLATION. OUR STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION SERVICES TARGETED AT D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS WHO SELECT AND PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND INSTALLATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS FROM US IN THE STORE. OUR INSTALLATION PROGRAMS INCLUDE PRODUCTS SUCH AS CARPETING, FLOORING, CABINETS, COUNTERTOPS AND WATER HEATERS. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION OF A NUMBER OF PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH OUR IN-HOME SALES PROGRAMS, SUCH AS ROOFING, SIDING, WINDOWS, FURNACES AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS.

•

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS

. THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND TRADESMEN. WE OFFER A VARIETY OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, DESIGNATED PARKING SPACES CLOSE TO STORE ENTRANCES AND BULK PRICING PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ONLINE AND IN-STORE PURCHASES. WE RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE SERVICE NEEDS OF THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER AND USE OUR EXPERTISE TO FACILITATE THEIR BUYING EXPERIENCE.

IN FISCAL

2012

, WE UNDERTOOK A NUMBER OF PROJECTS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS' SHOPPING EXPERIENCES. IN ADDITION TO RETRAINING OUR ASSOCIATES ON THE CUSTOMERS FIRST PROGRAM, WE ROLLED OUT THE "FIRST PHONE JUNIOR" TO ALL OF OUR

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STORES. THIS VERSION COMBINES THE COMMUNICATION FEATURES OF A PHONE WITH THE PRODUCT AND INVENTORY LOOKUP FEATURES OF OUR FIRST PHONE, BUT WITHOUT ITS COMPLEX BUSINESS ANALYTICS AND PRODUCT ORDERING FEATURES. WE CAN NOW SPREAD THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE BENEFITS OF THE FIRST PHONE THROUGHOUT THE STORE AT A LOWER COST. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NEW "STORE TO STORE" FEATURE, WHICH ALLOWS OUR ASSOCIATES TO LOOK UP INVENTORY IN OTHER STORES, RESERVE THE INVENTORY AND COMPLETE THE SALES TRANSACTION FOR THE CUSTOMER. WE CONTINUED TO TAKE TASKING OUT OF THE STORES SO THAT OUR ASSOCIATES CAN FOCUS ON ASSISTING CUSTOMERS. TO IMPROVE OUR LABOR EFFICIENCY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED TOOLS FOR AUTOMATED, IN-AISLE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT TO REPLACE OUR FORMER MANUAL, PAPER-DRIVEN PROCESSES. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, APPROXIMATELY 57% OF OUR STORE LABOR HOURS WERE DEDICATED TO CUSTOMER-FACING ACTIVITY, WITH A GOAL OF REACHING 60% BY THE END OF FISCAL 2013.

IN FISCAL 2012, WE CONTINUED TO AUTOMATE OUR SPECIAL ORDER AND INSTALLATION PROCESS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION AND TO SIMPLIFY THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND WE LAUNCHED MYINSTALL ON OUR WEBSITE, WHICH ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS AND TRACK THEIR PROJECTS ONLINE. OUR RECENT STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS ARE ALSO AIMED AT IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' HOME IMPROVEMENT EXPERIENCES. RED BEACON, ACQUIRED AT THE END OF FISCAL 2011, IS A WEBSITE THAT HELPS OUR D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS FIND PROFESSIONALS TO HELP THEM COMPLETE HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. THIS ACQUISITION ENABLES US TO DELIVER ON CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS BY MAKING IT EASIER TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE; IT ALLOWS US TO HELP OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS FIND JOBS; AND IT BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO ACQUIRED TWO COMPANIES THAT PROVIDED SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS – A FLOORING MEASUREMENT COMPANY AND A KITCHEN AND BATH REFACING COMPANY. THESE ACQUISITIONS ENABLE US TO STRENGTHEN AND UNIFY OUR CUSTOMERS' HOME SERVICES EXPERIENCE UNDER THE HOME DEPOT BRAND.

WE HELP OUR PROFESSIONAL, D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS FINANCE THEIR PROJECTS BY OFFERING PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT PRODUCTS IN OUR STORES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS. IN FISCAL

2012

, OUR CUSTOMERS OPENED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION NEW THE HOME DEPOT PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT ACCOUNTS, AND AT FISCAL YEAR END THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 MILLION. PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 22% OF SALES IN FISCAL

2012

. IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE AT THE REGISTER, WE COMPLETED OUR ROLLOUT OF PAYPAL

®

AS AN IN-STORE PAYMENT OPTION AND, IN CERTAIN STORES, IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THEIR RECEIPT.

OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ASSOCIATES ARE KEY TO OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE. WE EMPOWER OUR ASSOCIATES TO DELIVER EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGH OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST TRAINING PROGRAM, AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMPANY-SPONSORED PROGRAMS TO RECOGNIZE STORES AND INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER AND COMMUNITY SERVICE. AT THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 340,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 21,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE. WE MEASURE ASSOCIATE SATISFACTION REGULARLY AND MAINTAIN MULTIPLE MEANS OF ENSURING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR ASSOCIATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE VERY GOOD.

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. FISCAL 2012 INCLUDED 53 WEEKS, RATHER THAN 52 WEEKS. AS A RESULT, OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER IN 2012 INCLUDED AN EXTRA WEEK, WHICH INCREASED SALES FOR THAT QUARTER.

COMPETITION.

OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION BASED PRIMARILY ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY THE WORLD’S LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER, IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH INSTALLERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE FACE GROWING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE AND MULTICHANNEL RETAILERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

OUR BUSINESS HAS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED BRANDS IN NORTH AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE HOME DEPOT

®

TRADEMARK HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS, E-COMMERCE, STORES AND BUSINESS. WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION OF TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN PATENT PORTFOLIOS RELATING TO SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SEEK TO PATENT OR OTHERWISE PROTECT INNOVATIONS WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

LOGISTICS.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON CREATING A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH ENSURING PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVELY USING OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY, AND MANAGING TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. OUR FISCAL

2012

INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE AND EFFICIENTLY OPERATE OUR NETWORK, BUILD NEW LOGISTICS CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVE OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES.

OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL FLOW PATH FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT. RDCS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN OPTIMIZING OUR NETWORK AS THEY ALLOW FOR AGGREGATION OF PRODUCT NEEDS FOR MULTIPLE STORES TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON ARRIVAL AT THE RDC. THIS RESULTS IN A SIMPLIFIED ORDERING PROCESS AND IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. TO ENHANCE OUR RDC NETWORK, WE CONTINUED ADDING MECHANIZATION, AND AT THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, ALL 18 OF OUR U.S. RDCS WERE MECHANIZED. WE ALSO EXPANDED OUR U.S. TRANSLOAD PROGRAM FOR IMPORTED PRODUCTS TO FOUR FACILITIES OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES NEAR OCEAN PORTS. TRANSLOAD FACILITIES ALLOW US TO IMPROVE OUR IMPORT LOGISTICS COSTS AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT BY ENABLING IMPORTED PRODUCT TO FLOW THROUGH OUR RDC NETWORK.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE CENTRALIZED OUR INVENTORY PLANNING AND REPLENISHMENT FUNCTION AND IMPLEMENTED NEW FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS HAS HELPED US TO IMPROVE OUR IN-STOCK RATES AND OUR INVENTORY PRODUCTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME. AT THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, OVER 91% OF OUR U.S. STORE PRODUCTS WERE ORDERED THROUGH CENTRAL REPLENISHMENT.

IN ADDITION TO OUR 18 RDCS IN THE U.S., AT THE END OF FISCAL

, WE OPERATED 33 BULK DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHICH HANDLE PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED OPTIMALLY ON FLAT BED TRUCKS, IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. WE ALSO OPERATED 36 CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHICH INCLUDE STOCKING, DIRECT FULFILLMENT AND SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO LEVERAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITIES TO FULLY UTILIZE AND OPTIMIZE OUR IMPROVED LOGISTICS NETWORK.

COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS

.   THE HOME DEPOT IS COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THIS COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING ENERGY USAGE, SUPPLY CHAIN, STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, AND, AS NOTED ABOVE UNDER "ENERGY SAVING PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS," PRODUCT SELECTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

IN FISCAL

2012

, WE CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT STRICT OPERATIONAL STANDARDS THAT ESTABLISH ENERGY EFFICIENT PRACTICES IN ALL OF OUR U.S. FACILITIES. THESE INCLUDE HVAC UNIT TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND ADHERENCE TO STRICT LIGHTING SCHEDULES, WHICH ARE THE LARGEST SOURCES OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR STORES, AS WELL AS USE OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN EACH STORE TO MONITOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING AND UTILIZING THESE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS, WE HAVE SAVED OVER 5.5 BILLION KILOWATT HOURS (KWH) SINCE 2004, AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET OUR GOAL OF A 20% REDUCTION IN KWH PER SQUARE FOOT IN OUR U.S. STORES BY 2015.

THROUGH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "LOGISTICS," WE ARE TARGETING A 20% REDUCTION IN OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM 2008 TO 2015, WHICH WOULD EQUATE TO ANNUAL FUEL SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY 25 MILLION GALLONS. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO MONITOR OUR "CARBON FOOTPRINT" FROM THE OPERATION OF OUR STORES AS WELL AS FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY CHAIN ACTIVITIES. THROUGH OUR ENERGY CONSERVATION AND SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES, WE REDUCED OUR ABSOLUTE CARBON EMISSIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 777,000 METRIC TONS IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010.

WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUCTION OF OUR STORES, WE PARTNERED WITH THE U.S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL AND HAVE BUILT SEVEN LEED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION CERTIFIED OR SIMILARLY CERTIFIED STORES. IN 2012, WE OPENED A NEW STORE IN LODI, CALIFORNIA AND USED A GRANT FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO HELP DESIGN, MONITOR AND VERIFY THE ENERGY SAVINGS AT THAT STORE. THE BUILDING IS DESIGNED TO CONSUME SUBSTANTIALLY LESS ENERGY THAN THE 2007 90.1 ASHRAE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGINEERS, AN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY THAT SETS FORTH HVAC AND REFRIGERATION STANDARDS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A RAINWATER RECLAMATION PILOT IN 2010. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2012, WE HAVE RETROFITTED 81 OF OUR STORES WITH RECLAMATION TANKS TO COLLECT RAINWATER AND CONDENSATION FROM HVAC UNITS AND GARDEN CENTER ROOFS, WHICH IS IN TURN USED TO WATER PLANTS IN OUR OUTSIDE GARDEN CENTERS. IN SEPTEMBER 2011, WE OPENED A STORE IN ST. CROIX IN THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS WITH BOTH GROUND MOUNT AND ROOF MOUNT SOLAR PANEL SYSTEMS, AND WE ESTIMATE THE COMBINED TOTAL ANNUAL ENERGY PRODUCTION OF THESE SYSTEMS TO BE OVER 580 MEGAWATT HOURS.

OUR EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2012, WE WERE NAMED "RETAIL PARTNER OF THE YEAR" BY THE ENERGY STAR

®

DIVISION OF THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE "EPA") FOR OUR OVERALL EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND WE RECEIVED THE EPA'S WATERSENSE

®

"2012 ASSOCIATE EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AWARD." WE WERE ALSO RECOGNIZED AS A "HIGH PERFORMER" BY THE CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT.

WE ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE SHOPPING AND WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY ("EH&S") FUNCTION IS DEDICATED TO ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES, WITH TRAINED ASSOCIATES WHO EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS. OUR EH&S POLICIES ARE WOVEN INTO OUR EVERYDAY OPERATIONS AND ARE PART OF THE HOME DEPOT CULTURE. SOME COMMON PROGRAM ELEMENTS INCLUDE: DAILY STORE INSPECTION CHECKLISTS (BY DEPARTMENT); ROUTINE FOLLOW-UP AUDITS FROM OUR STORE-BASED SAFETY TEAM MEMBERS AND REGIONAL, DISTRICT AND STORE OPERATIONS FIELD TEAMS; EQUIPMENT ENHANCEMENTS AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL SAFETY; DEPARTMENTAL MERCHANDISING SAFETY STANDARDS; TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR ALL ASSOCIATES, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF TRAINING PROVIDED BASED ON AN ASSOCIATE'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES; AND AWARENESS, COMMUNICATION AND RECOGNITION PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO DRIVE OPERATIONAL AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF EH&S ISSUES.

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL

OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL INITIATIVE SUPPORTS AND CONNECTS OUR THREE OTHER KEY INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2012, WE FOCUSED ON LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER'S RETAIL EXPERIENCE AND PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS. AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THESE EFFORTS INCLUDED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT TAKE TASKS OUT OF THE STORE AND FREE OUR ASSOCIATES TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO CUSTOMER-FACING ACTIVITIES. THEY ALSO INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT WEBSITE ENHANCEMENTS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO MORE EASILY FIND AND PURCHASE AN EXPANDED ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE FOR THEIR PURCHASES (FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH OUR BOPIS, BORIS, BOSS AND "STORE TO STORE" PROGRAMS). THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES, CUSTOMERS CAN PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND TRACK THEIR INSTALLATION PROJECTS THROUGH MYINSTALL AND CAN CONNECT WITH OUR ASSOCIATES AND WITH ONE ANOTHER TO GAIN PRODUCT AND PROJECT KNOWLEDGE IN AREAS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IN FISCAL 2012, WE UPDATED THE ECO OPTIONS

®

PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTALLY-MINDED CUSTOMERS, AND WE HAD CONVENIENCE IN MIND WHEN WE INTRODUCED A MOBILE APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SELECT AND PURCHASE PRODUCTS QUICKLY. FURTHERMORE, TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR ASSOCIATES, MERCHANTS AND SUPPLIERS AND ENSURE THAT

THE RIGHT PRODUCT IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS, WE CONTINUED TO DEVELOP OUR DISTRIBUTION FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM FOR ENHANCED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CAUSING OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS – INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL – COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND APPEARANCE, AND QUALITY, AVAILABILITY AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS, AS WELL AS WITH INSTALLERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE FACE GROWING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE AND MULTICHANNEL RETAILERS AS OUR CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY USE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES TO SHOP ONLINE. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS OR OUR INABILITY TO ADAPT EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY TO A CHANGING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, OUR MARGINS OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, OUR MARKET SHARE AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS, CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS, AND UNEXPECTED WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHILE ALSO MANAGING INVENTORY LEVELS. FURTHER, WE HAVE AN AGING STORE BASE THAT REQUIRES MAINTENANCE TO DELIVER THE SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT OUR CUSTOMERS DESIRE. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING LABOR RELATIONS OR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF JOB SATISFACTION. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS (PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF CONTINUING ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE WORLD), SUPPLIERS’ NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, SHIPPING INTERRUPTIONS OR COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER OR COMPANY INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE TO AN INCREASING THREAT OF CONTINUALLY EVOLVING CYBERSECURITY RISKS. ANY SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF OUR DATA SECURITY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, CAUSE THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE, SUPPLIER OR COMPANY INFORMATION, AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS. WHILE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SECURED DATA AND PREVENT DATA LOSS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE PROCEDURES ARE ADEQUATE TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS.

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS AND MANAGE TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DATA IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS. WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR OUR INTERCONNECTED RETAIL STRATEGY AND GIVE RISE TO NEGATIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES.

THROUGH OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND A MULTICHANNEL EXPERIENCE THAT EMPOWERS OUR CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AND INTERACT WITH US FROM COMPUTERS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND OTHER MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES. WE USE OUR WEBSITE BOTH AS A SALES CHANNEL FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND ALSO AS A METHOD OF PROVIDING PRODUCT, PROJECT AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE BOTH IN-STORE AND ONLINE SALES. WE HAVE MULTIPLE ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND KNOWLEDGE CENTERS THAT ALLOW US TO INFORM, ASSIST AND INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. MULTICHANNEL RETAILING IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND EXPANDING, AND WE MUST EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS. DISRUPTIONS, FAILURES OR OTHER PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THESE CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD IMPAIR THE BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE TO OUR ONLINE AND IN-STORE BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHILE SIMPLIFYING CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A MORE INTERCONNECTED RETAIL EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYING NEW WEB-BASED TOOLS AND SERVICES, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MERCHANDISE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION WITHIN OUR LOGISTICS OR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK, INCLUDING DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INVENTORY IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOST SALES OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICE BUSINESS, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES AND BE SUBJECT TO FINES, LAWSUITS AND DAMAGED REPUTATION.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY OR PROVIDE PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THESE SERVICES, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS, AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. RECENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND REFORMS, AS WELL AS INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. CHANGES IN, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF, OR ADOPTION OF NEW FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER WAGE, LABOR OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS, THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, TAXES, ENERGY COSTS OR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS OR IMPACT OUR STORE OPERATIONS. HEALTHCARE REFORM UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS AND OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS UNDER OUR BENEFIT PLANS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT RETAIL OPERATIONS IN, AND SOURCE FROM, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME RISKS WE FACE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, POTENTIAL ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE, CHALLENGES IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVENTORIES, LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

WE ARE REPORTING THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS TO COMPLY WITH SEC REGULATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEEDINGS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS IF WE REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS MAY RESULT IN MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR MORE.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN SEPTEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY WAS CONTACTED BY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN THREE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT (THE "SCAQMD") AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES REGARDING ALLEGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY SOLD PRODUCTS IN THOSE COUNTIES WITH VOC (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND) LEVELS IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS PERMITTED BY SCAQMD RULES. IN JUNE 2011, TWO RELATED COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA – COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE FIRST ACTION WAS BROUGHT BY THE SCAQMD AND ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY SOLD PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER-THAN-PERMITTED VOC LEVELS. THIS ACTION SEEKS $30 MILLION IN CIVIL PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE SECOND ACTION WAS BROUGHT BY THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OF EACH OF ORANGE, RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES AND ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY ENGAGED IN UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FALSE ADVERTISING WHEN SELLING THESE PRODUCTS. THIS ACTION SEEKS UNSPECIFIED CIVIL PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. BOTH ACTIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE TRIED TOGETHER AS A BENCH TRIAL IN MAY 2013.

IN MARCH 2013, WE TENTATIVELY REACHED A JOINT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THESE ACTIONS FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $6.9 MILLION, PLUS $1.1 MILLION IN FEES AND COSTS. THE SETTLEMENT REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF THE TRIAL COURT.

EXCLUDING THE CHARGES RELATED TO THE CHINA STORE CLOSINGS, NET EARNINGS WERE $4.7 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $3.10 FOR FISCAL 2012.

NET SALES INCREASED

6.2%

TO $74.8 BILLION

FOR FISCAL

2012

FROM $70.4 BILLION

FOR FISCAL

FISCAL 2012 CONSISTED OF 53 WEEKS COMPARED WITH 52 WEEKS FOR FISCAL 2011. THE 53

RD

WEEK ADDED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN NET SALES AND INCREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.07 FOR FISCAL 2012.

IN FISCAL

2012

, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING FOUR KEY INITIATIVES.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

– OUR FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ANCHORED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF CREATING AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH CUSTOMERS, PUTTING CUSTOMERS FIRST AND SIMPLIFYING THE BUSINESS. IN FISCAL 2012, WE OPENED NEW CUSTOMER CALL CENTERS IN UTAH AND GEORGIA TO SUPPORT OUR INTERCONNECTED BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF INITIATIVES SUCH AS OUR NEW SCHEDULING SYSTEM FOR OUR ASSOCIATES AND A CENTRALIZED RETURN TO VENDOR PROCESS INITIATED IN FISCAL 2011, WE NOW HAVE APPROXIMATELY 57% OF OUR STORE LABOR HOURS DEDICATED TO CUSTOMER-FACING ACTIVITY AND EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF 60% IN FISCAL 2013. THROUGH THESE AND OTHER EFFORTS, WE CONTINUE TO SEE OUR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY SCORES IMPROVE.

PRODUCT AUTHORITY

– OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT AUTHORITY IS FACILITATED BY OUR MERCHANDISING TRANSFORMATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, WHICH IS AIMED AT DELIVERING PRODUCT INNOVATION, ASSORTMENT AND VALUE. AS PART OF THIS EFFORT, WE INTRODUCED INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS AND GREAT VALUES FOR BOTH OUR PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y CUSTOMERS IN A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS. ALSO IN FISCAL 2012, WE EXPANDED SOME OF OUR APPLIANCE SHOWROOMS TO INCLUDE THE ELECTROLUX

®

, WHIRLPOOL

®

AND FRIGIDAIRE

®

BRANDS. THESE BRANDS WERE ALSO ADDED TO OUR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM IN FISCAL 2012.

DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY

– OUR APPROACH TO DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY IS ADVANCED THROUGH CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT, INCREMENTAL SUPPLY CHAIN BENEFITS, DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND EXPENSE CONTROL AND BUILDING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH HIGHER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND TOTAL VALUE RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. IN FISCAL 2012, WE COMPLETED THE MECHANIZATION OF ALL OF OUR RDCS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PLATFORM. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO WAS 4.5 TIMES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO 4.3 TIMES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2011.

WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 74 MILLION SHARES FOR $4.0 BILLION THROUGH ASR AGREEMENTS AND THE OPEN MARKET DURING FISCAL

2012

. IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2013, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $17.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION, AND ANNOUNCED A 34% INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.39 PER SHARE.

INTERCONNECTED RETAIL

– OUR FOCUS ON INTERCONNECTED RETAIL IS BASED ON BUILDING A COMPETITIVE PLATFORM ACROSS ALL COMMERCE CHANNELS. DURING FISCAL 2012, WE LAUNCHED IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR WEBSITE, INCLUDING MYINSTALL, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION IN INSTALLATION PROJECTS AND TO SIMPLIFY THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE MADE SEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER WEBSITE, INCLUDING ADDING AN ONLINE BULK PRICING PROGRAM THAT MIRRORS OUR IN-STORE BULK PRICING PROGRAM. WE ALSO INTRODUCED NEW PROGRAMS, SUCH AS BUY ONLINE, RETURN IN STORE ("BORIS") AND BUY ONLINE, SHIP TO STORE ("BOSS") IN FISCAL 2012, TO EXPAND UPON BUY ONLINE, PICK-UP IN STORE ("BOPIS"), WHICH WE INTRODUCED IN FISCAL 2011.

IN MAY 2012, WE ACQUIRED MEASURECOMP L.L.C., A FLOORING MEASUREMENT AND QUOTE BUILDING COMPANY. MEASURECOMP'S BUSINESS WAS LARGELY DEDICATED TO THE HOME DEPOT AND BY IN-SOURCING THIS SERVICE UNDER HOME DEPOT MEASUREMENT SERVICES, WE EXPECT TO BUILD A SEAMLESS PROCESS FOR OUR FLOORING CUSTOMERS THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR THEM AND A BETTER CLOSE RATE FOR US.

IN OCTOBER 2012, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF U.S. HOME SYSTEMS, INC. ("USHS"). USHS WAS AN EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF KITCHEN AND BATH REFACING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS CLOSET AND GARAGE ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS TO THE HOME DEPOT. THIS ACQUISITION WILL ALLOW US TO CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN OUR STORES AND THE USHS IN-HOME SELLING PLATFORM UNDER HOME DEPOT INTERIORS, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH OUR ROOFING, SIDING AND WINDOWS BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BLACKLOCUS, INC. IN DECEMBER 2012. BLACKLOCUS IS A DATA ANALYTICS AND PRICING COMPANY, WHICH WILL BRING ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT OUR MERCHANDISING TEAM.

2012

, FOR A TOTAL STORE COUNT OF 2,256 AT THE END OF FISCAL

2012

. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, A TOTAL OF 280 OF OUR STORES, OR 12.4%, WERE LOCATED IN CANADA AND MEXICO.

2012

. WE USED THIS CASH FLOW TO FUND $4.0 BILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES, PAY $1.7 BILLION

OF DIVIDENDS AND FUND $1.3 BILLION

IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (COMPUTED ON NET OPERATING PROFIT AFTER TAX FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS AND THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY) WAS 17.0% FOR FISCAL

2012

COMPARED TO 14.9% FOR FISCAL

NON-GAAP MEASURES

TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO REFLECT CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2012 INCLUDED A $145 MILLION CHARGE, NET OF TAX, RELATED TO THE CHINA STORE CLOSINGS AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THERE WERE NO ADJUSTMENTS FOR FISCAL 2011 OR 2010 FOR EVENTS OF UNUSUAL NATURE OR FREQUENCY. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BETTER ENABLE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH MEANINGFUL INFORMATION RELEVANT TO EVENTS OF UNUSUAL NATURE OR FREQUENCY THAT IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. THE FOLLOWING RECONCILES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURES FOR FISCAL 2012 (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 3.5% TO $70.4 BILLION FROM $68.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2011 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASED 3.4% FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF 2.9% FOR FISCAL 2010.

THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2011 REFLECT A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE EXECUTION OF OUR KEY INITIATIVES, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN FISCAL 2011 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BENEFITS ARISING FROM OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION IN THE U.S., WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SHRINK COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010.

OPERATING EXPENSES

SG&A INCREASED 1.1% TO $16.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 FROM $15.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 22.8% FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO 23.3% FOR FISCAL 2010.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS $1.6 BILLION FOR BOTH FISCAL 2011 AND 2010. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.2% FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO 2.4% FOR FISCAL 2010. THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES REFLECTS EXPENSE LEVERAGE IN THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES ENVIRONMENT AND AN INCREASE IN FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 14.1% TO $6.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 FROM $5.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 9.5% FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO 8.6% FOR FISCAL 2010.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

IN FISCAL 2011, WE RECOGNIZED $593 MILLION OF INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, COMPARED TO $566 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.8% FOR BOTH FISCAL 2011 AND 2010. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2010 REFLECTS A $51 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE RELATED TO THE EXTENSION OF OUR HD SUPPLY GUARANTEE. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCED A $44 MILLION BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2010 THAT AROSE FROM FAVORABLE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE GUIDANCE AND A RESULTING REVERSAL OF AN INTEREST ACCRUAL.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED TO 36.0% FOR FISCAL 2011 FROM 36.7% FOR FISCAL 2010. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2011 REFLECTS A BENEFIT FROM THE REVERSAL OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO THE UTILIZATION OF CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FAVORABLE STATE AND LOCAL TAX SETTLEMENTS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $2.47 FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO $2.01 FOR FISCAL 2010. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL 2011 REFLECT $0.13 OF BENEFIT FROM REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 29, 2012.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL

2012

, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $7.0 BILLION

COMPARED TO $6.7 BILLION

FOR FISCAL

2011

. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS A $652 MILLION INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS RESULTING FROM HIGHER COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND EXPENSE CONTROLS. IN SUPPORT OF SALES GROWTH, WE GREW MERCHANDISE INVENTORY. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY, NET OF THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSETS THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY NET EARNINGS BY $330 MILLION.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL

2012

WAS $1.4 BILLION

COMPARED TO $1.1 BILLION

FOR FISCAL

2011

. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $105 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED, NET, IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011, NO PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF BUSINESS, NET, IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO $101 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011 RELATED TO THE SALE OF A NON-CORE CARPET CLEANING AND CABINET REFINISHING BUSINESS, AND A $91 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011.

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL

2012

WAS $5.0 BILLION

COMPARED TO $4.0 BILLION

FOR FISCAL

2011

. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HOW WE FUNDED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN FISCAL 2012, WE REPURCHASED $4.0 BILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK USING CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. IN FISCAL 2011, WE REPURCHASED $3.5 BILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES, AND FUNDED $1.0 BILLION OF THOSE REPURCHASES WITH PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. WE DID NOT ISSUE ANY LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IN FISCAL 2012. THE REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK IN FISCAL 2012 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $478 MILLION MORE IN PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF COMMON STOCK DUE TO INCREASED STOCK OPTION EXERCISES IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011.

IN FISCAL 2012, WE ENTERED INTO ASR AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REPURCHASE

$3.05 BILLION

OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, WE PAID

$3.05 BILLION

TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, USING CASH ON HAND, AND RECEIVED A TOTAL OF

58 MILLION

SHARES IN FISCAL 2012. ALSO IN FISCAL 2012, WE REPURCHASED 16 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $950 MILLION THROUGH THE OPEN MARKET. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $37.6 BILLION. IN FEBRUARY 2013, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $17.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MARCH 2011, WE ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 4.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2021 AT A DISCOUNT OF $2 MILLION AND $1.0 BILLION OF 5.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE APRIL 1, 2041 AT A DISCOUNT OF $4 MILLION (TOGETHER, THE "MARCH 2011 ISSUANCE"). INTEREST ON THESE SENIOR NOTES IS DUE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON APRIL 1 AND OCTOBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2011. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE MARCH 2011 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO REPURCHASE $1.0 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE BALANCE OF THE NET PROCEEDS WAS USED TO REPAY OUR 5.20% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED MARCH 1, 2011 IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MARCH 2011 ISSUANCE, WE ENTERED INTO AN ASR AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO REPURCHASE $1.0 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE PAID $1.0 BILLION TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 27 MILLION SHARES IN FISCAL 2011.

IN MARCH 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP THAT EXPIRES ON MARCH 1, 2016, WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, THAT SWAPS FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2016 FOR VARIABLE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 300 BASIS POINTS. AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THIS AGREEMENT WAS AN ASSET OF

$36 MILLION

, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT.

ALSO AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, WE HAD OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THAT EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 16, 2013 WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION THAT SWAP FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $1.25 BILLION 5.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16, 2013 FOR VARIABLE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 259 BASIS POINTS. AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS AN ASSET OF

$28 MILLION

, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENTS.

WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP TO

$2.0 BILLION

. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO

$2.0 BILLION

. AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS OR THE RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES IN JULY 2017 AND CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS, AND THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND RELATED CREDIT FACILITY.

WE USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY ON AUGUST 30, 2007, WE GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED AMORTIZING TERM LOAN OF HD SUPPLY. THE ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE OF THE GUARANTEE WAS AUGUST 30, 2012. IN MARCH 2010, WE AMENDED THE GUARANTEE TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE TO APRIL 1, 2014. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AT AUGUST 30, 2007 WAS $16 MILLION AND WAS RECORDED AS A LIABILITY IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THE EXTENSION OF THE GUARANTEE INCREASED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE TO $67 MILLION, RESULTING IN A $51 MILLION CHARGE TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2010. IN APRIL 2012, THE TERM LOAN GUARANTEE WAS TERMINATED. AS A RESULT, WE REVERSED THE $67 MILLION LIABILITY RELATED TO THE GUARANTEE, RESULTING IN A $67 MILLION PRETAX BENEFIT TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, FOR FISCAL 2012.

AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, WE HAD $2.5 BILLION

IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.

IN

MARCH 2013

, WE ENTERED INTO AN ASR AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO REPURCHASE

$1.5 BILLION

OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE WILL PAY

$1.5 BILLION

TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, USING CASH ON HAND, AND RECEIVE AN INITIAL DELIVERY OF APPROXIMATELY

18 MILLION

SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013. THE FINAL NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT WILL BE DETERMINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER THE TERM OF THE ASR AGREEMENT.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OPERATING LEASES FOR A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

(5)

EXCLUDES $533 MILLION OF NONCURRENT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE USED, AT TIMES, TO MANAGE OUR FIXED/FLOATING RATE DEBT PORTFOLIO. AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 82% OF OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AND 18% WAS FLOATING-RATE DEBT. A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE INTEREST COSTS OF FLOATING-RATE DEBT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $10.3 BILLION

OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THESE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

WAS APPROXIMATELY $12.2 BILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUES

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY

76%

VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER A COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE US, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2012

OR

2011.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

SELF-INSURANCE

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED LIABILITIES FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY (INCLUDING PRODUCTS LIABILITY), WORKERS’ COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL AND AUTOMOBILE CLAIMS FOR WHICH WE ARE SELF-INSURED. OUR SELF-INSURED RETENTION OR DEDUCTIBLE, AS APPLICABLE, FOR EACH CLAIM INVOLVING GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO $25 MILLION, $1 MILLION AND $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY STOP LOSS LIMITS FOR SELF-INSURED EMPLOYEE GROUP MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITIES REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED AND ARE ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES. THE LIABILITIES ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF VENDORS’ PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS’ PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS LOOK SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ON VARIABLES SUCH AS FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN GROWTH RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET COMPETITION AND INFLATION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE STORES WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ARE GENERALLY BASED ON MARKET APPRAISALS OF OWNED LOCATIONS AND ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL SUBLEASE INCOME AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE FOR LEASED LOCATIONS. A 10% DECREASE IN ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME AND A 10% INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO SUBLEASE WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATION COSTS ON CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS FOR THE CHINA STORE CLOSINGS IN FISCAL 2012, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL BUT DO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT, BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS. DURING FISCAL

2012

, FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS OTHER THAN OUR CHINA REPORTING UNIT, WE USED QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE THAT OUR GOODWILL BALANCES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WERE NOT IMPAIRED. FOR OUR CHINA REPORTING UNIT, WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $97 MILLION TO IMPAIR ALL OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REPORTING UNIT IN FISCAL

2012

. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR REMAINING GOODWILL WERE

NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

WE AMORTIZE THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE UP TO

TEN

YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS WARRANT. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL

2012

,

2011

OR

2010.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2011-05, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME" ("ASU NO. 2011-05"). ASU NO. 2011-05 ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNDER ASU NO. 2011-05, AN ENTITY CAN ELECT TO PRESENT ITEMS OF NET EARNINGS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN ONE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OR IN TWO SEPARATE, BUT CONSECUTIVE, STATEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011 AND FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS THEREAFTER, AND RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION WAS REQUIRED. THIS GUIDANCE IMPACTED THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY. BOTH THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE "EXCHANGE ACT"). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

IN PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT, INC.’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE "COMPANY") OPERATE THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY

104,000

SQUARE FEET OF ENCLOSED SPACE, WITH APPROXIMATELY

24,000

ADDITIONAL SQUARE FEET OF OUTSIDE GARDEN AREA. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY

30,000

TO

40,000

DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS OVER

600,000

PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS HOME DEPOT AND HOME DECORATORS COLLECTION WEBSITES. AT THE END OF FISCAL

2012

, THE COMPANY WAS OPERATING

2,256

THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH INCLUDED

1,976

STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO AND THE TERRITORIES OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND GUAM ("U.S."),

180

STORES IN CANADA AND

100

STORES IN MEXICO. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL YEAR

THE COMPANY’S FISCAL YEAR IS A

52

- OR

53

-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO

JANUARY 31

. THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

("FISCAL

2012

") INCLUDES 53 WEEKS AND FISCAL YEARS ENDED

JANUARY 29, 2012

("FISCAL

2011

") AND

JANUARY 30, 2011

("FISCAL

2010

") INCLUDE

52

WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF

THREE

MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY’S CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE COMPANY’S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE RELATED RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER EXPIRES IN

2018

, WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS’ USE OF THE CARDS AND ANY PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A"). THE SUM OF THE THREE IS REFERRED TO BY THE COMPANY AS "THE COST OF CREDIT" OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $42 MILLION

AND $45 MILLION

AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

AND

JANUARY 29, 2012

, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY’S VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2012

OR

2011.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS IN CANADA AND MEXICO, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY A COST METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

24%

OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING A COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER A COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL

2012

OR

2011.

INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF THOSE POSITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED. RECOGNIZED INCOME TAX POSITIONS ARE MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN

50%

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. CHANGES IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN JUDGMENT OCCURS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES FOR THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EACH QUARTER FOR INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE CURRENT PERIOD LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY OF LOSSES, MANAGEMENT’S DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OR WHEN CHANGES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE INDIVIDUAL STORE LEVEL.

THE ASSETS OF A STORE WITH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES MANAGEMENT’S ASSUMPTIONS OF CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THOSE ASSETS IN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING GROSS MARGIN ON NET SALES, PAYROLL AND RELATED ITEMS, OCCUPANCY COSTS, INSURANCE ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER COSTS TO OPERATE A STORE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LEASED LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

THE COMPANY ASSESSES QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES FROM

2012

TO

2029

. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE STATE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES. THEREFORE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2013

AND

JANUARY 29, 2012

WERE

$27 MILLION

AND

$19 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

IN FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE A PORTION OF ITS CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD. THIS UTILIZATION COMBINED WITH OTHER AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES ENABLED THE COMPANY TO RELEASE ITS

$45 MILLION

VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY

$2.7 BILLION

OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY’S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY APPEALING CERTAIN PROPOSED INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE EXAMINATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2007. THE COMPANY'S U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2009 ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE IRS. THERE ARE ALSO ONGOING U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AND OTHER FOREIGN AUDITS COVERING TAX YEARS 2005 TO 2010. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY INCOME TAX AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAX EXAMINATIONS COULD REDUCE OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY

$105 MILLION

. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS THAN THIS AMOUNT, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRICE AT WHICH THE ASSET COULD BE SOLD IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN UNRELATED KNOWLEDGEABLE AND WILLING PARTIES. A LIABILITY’S FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE PAID TO TRANSFER THE LIABILITY TO A NEW OBLIGOR, RATHER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE PAID TO SETTLE THE LIABILITY WITH THE CREDITOR. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ARE MEASURED USING A THREE-TIER FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THESE TIERS INCLUDE.

•

LEVEL 1

–

OBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS

•

LEVEL 2

–

INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE

•

LEVEL 3
