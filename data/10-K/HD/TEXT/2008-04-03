PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

INTRODUCTION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER AND THE SECOND LARGEST RETAILER IN THE UNITED STATES ("U.S."), BASED ON NET SALES FOR THE FISCAL

YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008 ("FISCAL 2007"). AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE WERE OPERATING 2,234 STORES, MOST OF WHICH ARE THE HOME DEPOT STORES.

THE

HOME DEPOT STORES SELL A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE A NUMBER OF SERVICES. THE HOME DEPOT STORES AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 105,000

SQUARE FEET OF ENCLOSED SPACE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 23,000 ADDITIONAL SQUARE FEET OF OUTSIDE GARDEN AREA. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE HAD 2,193 THE HOME DEPOT STORES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.

(INCLUDING THE TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND GUAM), CANADA, CHINA AND MEXICO. IN ADDITION, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY OPERATED 34 EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, TWO THD

DESIGN CENTER STORES AND FIVE YARDBIRDS STORES.

ON

AUGUST 30, 2007, WE CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $8.3 BILLION AND RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $4 MILLION, NET OF TAX, FOR THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WE PURCHASED A 12.5% EQUITY INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED HD SUPPLY FOR $325 MILLION AND GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED LOAN OF HD SUPPLY.

THE

HOME DEPOT, INC. IS A DELAWARE CORPORATION THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN 1978. OUR STORE SUPPORT CENTER (CORPORATE OFFICE) IS LOCATED AT 2455 PACES FERRY ROAD, N.W., ATLANTA, GEORGIA 30339. OUR

TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (770) 433-8211.

WE

MAINTAIN AN INTERNET WEBSITE AT WWW.HOMEDEPOT.COM. WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE, FREE OF CHARGE, OUR ANNUAL REPORTS TO SHAREHOLDERS, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, PROXY STATEMENTS AND FORMS 3, 4 AND 5 AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER FILING SUCH DOCUMENTS

WITH, OR FURNISHING SUCH DOCUMENTS TO, THE SEC.

WE

INCLUDE OUR WEBSITE ADDRESSES THROUGHOUT THIS FILING ONLY AS TEXTUAL REFERENCES. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OUR WEBSITES IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR BUSINESS

OPERATING STRATEGY.

IN FISCAL 2007, FOLLOWING CHANGES IN SENIOR COMPANY MANAGEMENT AND IN THE FACE OF RAPID

DETERIORATION IN THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, WE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF FOCUSING ON OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, INVESTING IN OUR ASSOCIATES AND

STORES, IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS. WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY; WE COMPLETED APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF OUR $22.5 BILLION

RECAPITALIZATION PLAN BY ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES; AND WE INVESTED OVER $2 BILLION IN FIVE KEY OPERATING PRIORITIES: ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT, PRODUCT EXCITEMENT,

PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND OWN THE PRO. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EFFORTS ON EACH OF THESE KEY PRIORITIES MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7.

CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.



DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y")

CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE EXPERTISE OF OUR

ASSOCIATES, THE HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE VENDORS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M")

CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY

HOME OWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR INSTALLATION. WE ARRANGE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A VARIETY OF THE HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS THROUGH

QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.



PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL REMODELERS, GENERAL

CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND TRADESMEN. IN MANY STORES, WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND WILL-CALL SERVICES,

DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE SELECTIONS AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE BELIEVE INCREASE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS.

TO

COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT SELECTION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF

WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. DURING FISCAL 2007, WE OFFERED A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BEHR PREMIUM

FROM

OUR STORE SUPPORT CENTER WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

MERCHANTS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND PURCHASE MARKET LEADING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE FOUR SOURCING OFFICES LOCATED IN THE CHINESE CITIES

STORES AND OUR TWO THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORES.

FINANCIAL

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. IS REPORTED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

DURING FISCAL 2007, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO BETTER

SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OVERALL SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE.

WITH

OUR FOCUS ON THE STORES, WE PROVIDED TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS DESIGNED TO HELP STORE ASSOCIATES PERFORM THEIR JOBS AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. OVER 650 STORES RECEIVED NEW COMPUTERS, REGISTERS

AND PRINTERS, WHILE OVER 1,100 STORES RECEIVED A REFRESH OF THEIR SELF-CHECKOUT EQUIPMENT. ALL STORES RECEIVED A DESIGN SYSTEM UPGRADE AND NEW EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW SALES TO BE PROCESSED IN

THE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AND OVER 100 STORES RECEIVED NEW PAINT DISPENSERS. A SATELLITE-BASED NETWORK WAS DEPLOYED TO ALL STORES IN ORDER TO INCREASE NETWORK RESILIENCY AND CONNECTIVITY TO OUR DATA

CENTERS. ALONG WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STORES, WE INSTALLED NEW HARDWARE IN APPROXIMATELY 18 LOGISTICS FACILITIES.

THE

INSTALLATION OF A NEW RADIO CALL BOX SYSTEM, DESIGNED TO HELP CUSTOMERS OBTAIN IN-AISLE ASSISTANCE, WAS COMPLETED IN EVERY STORE ACROSS THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE DEPLOYMENT OF

SELF-CHECKOUT REGISTERS TO ALL OUR STORES WAS COMPLETED, AND NEW COUPON HANDLING AUTOMATION WAS IMPLEMENTED. WE EQUIPPED MANAGERS, DESIGNERS AND EXPEDITERS WITH BLACKBERRY/CELL PHONE

DEVICES AND E-MAIL ACCOUNTS ENABLING THEM TO MORE EASILY COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS.

IN

ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN STORE TECHNOLOGY, NEW WAREHOUSE AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY WAS IMPLEMENTED IN SUPPORT OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. A NEW CUSTOMER CARE TECHNOLOGY WAS

IMPLEMENTED IN THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER AND EACH STORE TO ASSIST WITH RECORDING AND

RESOLVING CUSTOMER DISPUTES. CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WAS MADE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ERP SYSTEM (CORE RETAIL) THAT WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED IN CANADA IN 2008.

CREDIT SERVICES.

WE OFFER SIX CREDIT PROGRAMS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDERS TO PROFESSIONAL,

D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2007, APPROXIMATELY 4.3 MILLION NEW THE HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS WERE OPENED, AND THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF THE HOME DEPOT ACTIVE ACCOUNT HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 29% OF STORE SALES IN FISCAL 2007.

LOGISTICS.

OUR LOGISTICS PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY AND LOW TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE

4

OPERATED

30 LUMBER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO, AND 39 CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE ALSO OPERATED

EIGHT TRANSIT FACILITIES IN THE U.S. AND MEXICO TO RECEIVE AND CONSOLIDATE STORE MERCHANDISE ORDERS FROM SUPPLIERS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES.

IN

FISCAL 2007, APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE MERCHANDISE SHIPPED TO OUR U.S. STORES FLOWED THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, AND ABOUT 20% THROUGH THE TRANSIT FACILITIES. THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WAS

SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS TO OUR STORES.

DURING

FISCAL 2007, WE INTRODUCED IMPROVED FLOW-THROUGH DISTRIBUTION PROCESSES IN AN EXISTING U.S. TRANSIT FACILITY BY CONVERTING IT TO A RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTER ("RDC"). RDCS ALLOW

FOR AGGREGATION OF STORE PRODUCT NEEDS TO A SINGLE PURCHASE ORDER, AND THEN RAPID ALLOCATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY TO INDIVIDUAL STORES UPON ARRIVAL AT THE CENTER. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS IMPROVED

TRANSPORTATION, SIMPLIFIED ORDER PROCESSING AT SUPPLIERS, AND REDUCED LEAD TIME FROM STORE PRODUCT NEED DETERMINATION TO REPLENISHMENT. WE OPENED A SECOND RDC FACILITY IN JANUARY 2008. WE PLAN TO OPEN

SEVERAL MORE RDCS IN THE U.S. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO INCREASE OUR CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT FLOW-THROUGH.

IN

ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE DELIVERY OF IN-STOCK AND SPECIAL ORDER PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

ASSOCIATES.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 331,000 ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 26,000

WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY OR TEMPORARY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 67% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

ARE VERY GOOD. TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED

FOR REGISTRATION, IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FOR A VARIETY OF INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES, SERVICE MARKS AND TRADEMARKS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE HOME DEPOT®; HAMPTON

BAY® FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES; GLACIER BAY® TOILETS, SINKS AND FAUCETS; PEGASUS® FAUCETS AND BATH ACCESSORIES; COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC® LIGHTING

FIXTURES; WORKFORCE® TOOLS, TOOL BOXES AND SHELVING; AND WWW.DOITHERSELF.COM. WE HAVE ALSO OBTAINED AND NOW MAINTAIN PATENT PORTFOLIOS RELATING TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY

THE HOME DEPOT, AND CONTINUALLY SEEK TO PATENT OR OTHERWISE PROTECT SELECTED INNOVATIONS WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE REGARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS HAVING

SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO OUR BUSINESS AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF OUR BRAND, E-COMMERCE, STORES AND NEW AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS THAT COULD

BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM.

WE HAVE BOTH QUALITY ASSURANCE AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES WHO OVERSEE THE QUALITY OF OUR

DIRECTLY IMPORTED GLOBALLY-SOURCED AND PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS. THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR SUPPLIER AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE OUR PRODUCTS COMPLY

WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL QUALITY/PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THESE PROGRAMS ALSO ALLOW US TO MEASURE AND TRACK TIMELINESS OF SHIPMENTS. THESE PERFORMANCE RECORDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO

ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE PROGRAM ADDRESSES QUALITY ASSURANCE AT THE FACTORY, PRODUCT AND PACKAGING LEVELS.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH & SAFETY ("EH&S").

WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR

CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. OUR EH&S FUNCTION IN THE FIELD IS DIRECTED BY TRAINED ASSOCIATES FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EXECUTION OF

THE EH&S PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE AN ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED EH&S PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE, DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND PROGRAMS ON A

COMPANY-WIDE BASIS.

5

ENVIRONMENTAL.

THE HOME DEPOT IS COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND THIS

COMMITMENT IMPACTS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING STORE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, ENERGY USAGE, PRODUCT SELECTION AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION. IN FISCAL 2007, WE BUDGETED APPROXIMATELY

$50 MILLION FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY RELATED PROJECTS. BY REPLACING HVAC UNITS IN APPROXIMATELY 200 EXISTING STORES AND SWITCHING TO THE USE OF T-5 LIGHTING IN APPROXIMATELY

600 EXISTING STORES, WE ESTIMATE SAVINGS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION SINCE FISCAL 2006. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED STRICT OPERATIONAL STANDARDS THAT ESTABLISH ENERGY EFFICIENT

PRACTICES IN ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. THESE INCLUDE HVAC UNIT TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND ADHERENCE TO STRICT LIGHTING SCHEDULES, WHICH ARE THE LARGEST SOURCES OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OUR STORES, AS

WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NOVAR ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND ALARM SYSTEM IN EACH STORE TO MONITOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT BY IMPLEMENTING THESE ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMS WE HAVE AVOIDED

907 MILLION POUNDS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO REMOVING APPROXIMATELY 75,000 CARS FROM THE HIGHWAY.

WE

HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO FURTHER OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS. WE PARTNERED WITH THE U.S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL AND HAVE BUILT FIVE LEED GREEN CERTIFIED STORES. WE OFFSET THE CARBON

EMISSIONS CREATED BY OUR FACILITIES AND A PORTION OF THOSE EMISSIONS CREATED BY BUSINESS RELATED TRAVEL THROUGH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CONSERVATION FUND THAT RESULTED IN THE PLANTING OF THOUSANDS OF

TREES THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE HEAT-ISLAND EFFECT IN URBAN AREAS, REDUCE EROSION AND HELP CLEAN THE AIR. THROUGH OUR ECO OPTIONS

SM

PROGRAM, WE HAVE CREATED PRODUCT

CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EASILY IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERRED PRODUCT SELECTIONS IN OUR STORES. WE IMPLEMENTED A SUPPLIER SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT

OUR SUPPLIERS ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR

SECOND FISCAL QUARTER AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND

ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH

RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.

DUE TO THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSUMPTIONS, EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS ARE REASONABLE IN VIEW OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, YOU ARE

CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE EVENTS, RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES  MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL OR ARE UNKNOWN TO US  AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS"

IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT,

GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. SUCH FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

6

THE STATE OF THE HOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS, RISING COSTS, A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, WEATHER AND OTHER

CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

IN RECENT MONTHS, THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS HAVE DETERIORATED DRAMATICALLY. WE EXPECT THE DETERIORATION TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2008, AND

OUR FISCAL 2008 NET SALES AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO DECLINE. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS,

LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS

AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL  COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS COULD.



INCREASE

OUR COSTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY UNDERTAKING OR DETERMINE NOT TO UNDERTAKE NEW HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND



LEAD

TO A DECLINE IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS, AND IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OUR ABILITY TO

TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH

STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS' NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY OF PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF

WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIATION.

ANY INABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ON SCHEDULE WILL DELAY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE NEW STORES TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN CERTAIN EXISTING MARKETS AND ENTER NEW MARKETS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO.



IDENTIFY

ATTRACTIVE LOCATIONS,



NEGOTIATE

LEASES OR REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS,



ATTRACT

AND TRAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND



MANAGE

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

7

ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS, LOCAL ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LAND USE AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS WILL AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO OPEN STORES ON SCHEDULE, WHICH WILL DELAY THE IMPACT OF THESE NEW STORES ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW

OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A BETTER EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND

TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO DESIGN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES, SPENDING

PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT OUR

SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

OUR STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND THE OPENING OF NEW STORES. OUR ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN EXPANDING OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND

DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES.

TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT

TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS,

8

INCLUDING

PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE IN HOURLY POSITIONS WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH TURNOVER RATES. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL

BUSINESSES FOR THESE ASSOCIATES AND INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. WE ALSO DEPEND ON OUR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY ASSOCIATES FOR OUR SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT

WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE

RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, INVENTORIES, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE

ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INCREASED COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE

SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT

STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR

SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALERS AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASES. INTENSE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY,

SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOMES OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, WITH CERTAINTY. THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TAX REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

MASSACHUSETTS, MISSOURI, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, TENNESSEE, TEXAS AND VIRGINIA, FIVE YARDBIRDS STORES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND TWO THD DESIGN CENTER STORES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. WE

ALSO OPERATED NINE HOME DECORATORS COLLECTION LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KANSAS, MISSOURI, NORTH CAROLINA AND OKLAHOMA.

OF

OUR 2,234 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, APPROXIMATELY 87% WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 205.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET, AND

APPROXIMATELY 13% OF SUCH STORES WERE LEASED CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 29.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE OWNED.

AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE UTILIZED 206 WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN 46 STATES, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 30.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY

0.5 MILLION IS OWNED AND APPROXIMATELY 29.6 MILLION IS LEASED.

OUR

EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF, DIVISIONAL STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WE

STORE SUPPORT CENTERS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTERS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INFORMAL REQUEST FROM THE STAFF OF THE SEC FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES. SUBSEQUENT TO AUGUST 2005, THE SEC STAFF REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SUCH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE SEC STAFF LAST CONTACTED THE COMPANY REGARDING THIS MATTER IN

JANUARY 2007. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THIS REQUEST AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC STAFF. THE SEC HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMAL INQUIRY IS NOT AN INDICATION THAT ANY

VIOLATIONS OF LAW HAVE OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS INFORMAL INQUIRY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JUNE 2006, THE SEC COMMENCED AN INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES, AND THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALSO REQUESTED

INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT. THE SEC STAFF LAST CONTACTED THE COMPANY REGARDING THIS MATTER IN JANUARY 2007. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO EACH REQUEST AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC AND

THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY. IN ADDITION, A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWED THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND ENGAGED INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO ASSIST IN THIS

MATTER. ON DECEMBER 6, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE UNRECORDED EXPENSE FROM 1981 THROUGH THE PRESENT IS APPROXIMATELY

$227 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING RELATED TAX ITEMS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, "CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS

WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS," THE COMPANY CORRECTED THESE ERRORS BY DECREASING BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 BY $227 MILLION, WITH

OFFSETTING ENTRIES TO PAID-IN CAPITAL, OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, WITHIN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE MATTERS, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND, IN SOME CASES, AGAINST CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT

THEIR OUTCOME, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ACTIONS, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, SIX PURPORTED, BUT AS YET UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA, ALLEGING CERTAIN MISREPRESENTATIONS IN VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND

RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE FILED BY CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF THE

COMPANY. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS DISMISSED HIS COMPLAINT. THE COURT PRELIMINARILY APPOINTED A LEAD PLAINTIFF, AND THE LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN

EACH OF THE REMAINING FIVE ACTIONS. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT INCLUDES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. ON JULY 18, 2007, THE COURT GRANTED THE DEFENDANTS'

MOTIONS TO DISMISS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND AND ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS' APPEAL FROM THE DISMISSAL IS PENDING IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT.

IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, THREE PURPORTED, BUT UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE HOME DEPOT FUTUREBUILDER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE AND CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES IN FEDERAL COURT IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN VIOLATION OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR AND STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA

IN ATLANTA. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, THE PLAINTIFFS JOINED TOGETHER IN ONE CASE AND VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THE OTHER TWO CASES. IN MARCH 2007, THE THREE ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS AND TWO

ADDITIONAL FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED A JOINT

12

AMENDED

COMPLAINT SEEKING CERTIFICATION AS A CLASS ACTION, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, COSTS, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2007, THE COURT GRANTED THE

DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS AND ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR THE DEFENDANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS' APPEAL FROM THE DISMISSAL IS PENDING IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT.

IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, SIX SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS WERE FILED NOMINALLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AGAINST CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ABUSE OF CONTROL, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S

RETURN-TO-VENDOR, STOCK OPTION, AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. RELIEF SOUGHT IN EACH ACTION INCLUDES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, BENEFITS AND

COMPENSATION OBTAINED BY THE DEFENDANTS, COSTS, AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. SUBSEQUENTLY, ONE JOINT AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON BEHALF OF ALL PLAINTIFFS ENCOMPASSING ALL THE VARIOUS CLAIMS AND SEEKING THE

SAME RELIEF. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS OR ALTERNATIVELY STAY THE LITIGATION.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, THREE ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS WERE FILED NOMINALLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AGAINST CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT DIRECTORS AND ITS FORMER

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA. THE THREE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, AND PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED

COMPLAINT, ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ABUSE OF CONTROL, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION

PRACTICES. RELIEF SOUGHT

IN THE ACTION INCLUDES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, A PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY FILED A SECURITIES LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS, ALLEGING THAT THE DEFENDANTS VIOLATED SECTION 14(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 14A-9 THEREUNDER IN CONNECTION WITH

THE ISSUANCE OF THE COMPANY'S 2005 PROXY STATEMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE 2005 PROXY WAS MATERIALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE IT DID NOT DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH SEEKING SHAREHOLDER

APPROVAL OF A NEW STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN THAT THE COMPANY HAD GRANTED BACKDATED STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE OLD PLAN. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS TO VOID THE VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE NEW PLAN, CANCEL THE NEW PLAN, AND

CANCEL OR VOID ANY STOCK OPTIONS OR OTHER AWARDS MADE OR ISSUED UNDER THE NEW PLAN. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

THE

PARTIES TO THE DERIVATIVE AND SECTION 14(A) ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT DATED MARCH 28, 2008. PURSUANT TO THE STIPULATION, THE COMPANY WILL

MAINTAIN OR ADOPT CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGREED TO PAY PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES IN THE AMOUNT OF

$14.5 MILLION. THE SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING THE AWARD TO PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL, IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS.

FROM

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001 THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, CURRENT AND FORMER HOURLY ASSOCIATES HAVE FILED EIGHT CURRENT LAWSUITS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS, CONTAINING MULTIPLE CLASS-ACTION

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY FORCED THEM TO WORK "OFF THE CLOCK" OR FAILED TO PROVIDE WORK BREAKS, OR OTHERWISE THAT THEY WERE NOT PAID FOR WORK PERFORMED. THE COMPLAINTS GENERALLY SEEK UNSPECIFIED

MONETARY DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR BOTH. CLASS OR COLLECTIVE-ACTION CERTIFICATION HAS YET TO BE ADDRESSED IN MOST OF THESE CASES. THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE

OF LOSS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM THESE LAWSUITS. THESE MATTERS, IF DECIDED ADVERSELY TO OR SETTLED BY THE COMPANY, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITSELF AGAINST THESE ACTIONS.

IN

COMPLIANCE WITH SEC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDING SET FORTH BELOW INVOLVES POTENTIAL MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR MORE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME

13

OF

THIS PROCEEDING, IT DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SUCH OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA

FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008 ("FISCAL 2007"), WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF $4.4 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.37 COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS

OF $5.8 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.79 FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2007 ("FISCAL 2006").

ON

AUGUST 30, 2007, WE CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $8.3 BILLION FOR THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY AND RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $4 MILLION, NET OF TAX, FOR THE

SALE OF THE BUSINESS. HD SUPPLY IS BEING REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

WE

REPORTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $4.2 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.27 FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS OF $5.3 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.55 FOR FISCAL 2006. NET SALES DECREASED 2.1% TO $77.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM

$79.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS 33.6% AND OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 9.4% FOR FISCAL 2007.

FISCAL

2007 CONSISTED OF 53 WEEKS COMPARED WITH 52 WEEKS FOR FISCAL 2006. THE 53

RD

WEEK ADDED APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION IN NET SALES AND INCREASED DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR FISCAL 2007.

THE

SLOWDOWN IN THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2007. OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINED 6.7% IN FISCAL 2007 DRIVEN BY A 4.4%

DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS A 2.4% DECLINE IN OUR AVERAGE TICKET TO $57.48.

WE

BELIEVE THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET WILL REMAIN SOFT IN 2008. WE EXPECT OUR NET SALES TO DECLINE BY 4% TO 5% AND OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 19% TO 24% FOR FISCAL 2008.

WE

REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF OUR BUSINESS THROUGH OUR STRATEGY OF INVESTING IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE KEY PRIORITIES.

ASSOCIATE

ENGAGEMENT  WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT BY CHANGING THE WAY OUR ASSOCIATES ARE COMPENSATED, RECOGNIZED AND REWARDED, INCLUDING

RESTRUCTURING OUR SUCCESS SHARING PROGRAM, AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR OUR HOURLY ASSOCIATES DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUAL STORE PERFORMANCE. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, 44% OF OUR STORES WERE ELIGIBLE TO

RECEIVE A SUCCESS SHARING PAYOUT FOR THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 23% OF STORES FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A PROGRAM EARLIER THIS YEAR TO HIRE MASTER TRADE

SPECIALISTS TO BRING ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING EXPERIENCE AND KNOW-HOW TO THE STORES AND TO TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE TO OTHER ASSOCIATES. WE NOW HAVE OVER 2,500 MASTER TRADE SPECIALISTS IN OUR

STORES.

PRODUCT

EXCITEMENT  IN FISCAL 2007, WE ACCELERATED CLEARANCE MARKDOWNS TO SELL THROUGH EXISTING PRODUCT IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR NEW MERCHANDISE AS WE LAUNCHED OUR ENHANCED

PRODUCT LINE REVIEW PROCESS AND IN SUPPORT OF MERCHANDISING RESET ACTIVITIES. WE GAINED MARKET SHARE IN PAINT, APPLIANCES AND POWER TOOLS IN FISCAL 2007 THROUGH THE ADDITION OF NEW STYLES AND COLOR

CHOICES AND BY ENHANCING OUR PRODUCT DISPLAYS. IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR MERCHANDISING RESETS AND IMPLEMENTED CHANGE FROM OUR PRODUCT LINE REVIEW PROCESS, COLLECTIVELY THESE CATEGORIES ARE

OUTPERFORMING STORE SALES PERFORMANCE IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS.

SHOPPING

ENVIRONMENT  WE CONTINUED OUR STORE REINVESTMENT PROGRAM BY COMPLETING AN AGGRESSIVE LIST OF MAINTENANCE PROJECTS, INCLUDING NEW LIGHTING AND BASIC CLEAN-UP

ACTIVITIES FOR OVER HALF OF OUR STORES, AS WELL AS MORE COMPLEX REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES FOR HUNDREDS OF OTHER STORES. IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMMATIC MAINTENANCE, OUR INTEGRATED FIELD AND

SUPPORT CENTER TEAMS HAVE ROLLED OUT STORE

19

STANDARDS

TO ALL STORES. WE DEVELOPED AND PILOTED COMMON GUIDELINES ON STORE APPEARANCE AND SHOPABILITY, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR FRONT APRON MERCHANDISING, WINGSTACK USAGE, SIGNAGE PRESENTATION,

FIXTURING AND OFF-SHELF PRODUCT. THIS INITIATIVE HELPS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME OUR STORE MANAGERS SPEND ON THESE ISSUES, REMOVES UNNECESSARY CLUTTER FROM THE AISLES AND IMPLEMENTS A

BASIC CONSISTENT APPROACH IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE.

PRODUCT

AVAILABILITY  WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSFORMATION TO IMPROVE PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. WE HAVE IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF OUR IN-STOCK

POSITION, IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR REPLENISHMENT SYSTEMS AND BEGUN A ROLLOUT OF A NEW WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A PILOT OF OUR RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS. OPTIMALLY, MORE

VOLUME WILL PASS THROUGH THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT CENTERS THAN THROUGH OUR TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.

OWN

THE PRO  WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE OUR PRO CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH OUR PRO BID ROOM. THE PRO BID ROOM, WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN ALL

OF OUR STORES, ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE THE BUYING POWER OF THE HOME DEPOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR PRO CUSTOMERS. OUR DIRECT SHIP PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO HAVE LARGE ORDERS DELIVERED FROM OUR VENDORS TO THE

CUSTOMER'S JOB SITE DIRECTLY, REDUCING HANDLING, LEAD-TIME AND COST WHILE BUILDING LOYALTY WITH THE PRO CUSTOMER.

WE

OPENED 110 NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2007, INCLUDING 10 RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR TOTAL STORE COUNT AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007 TO 2,234. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, 243, OR APPROXIMATELY 11%, OF OUR

STORES WERE LOCATED IN CANADA, MEXICO OR CHINA COMPARED TO 228 AS OF FISCAL 2006.

WE

GENERATED $5.7 BILLION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2007. WE USED THIS CASH FLOW, ALONG WITH THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY, TO FUND $10.8 BILLION OF SHARE

REPURCHASES, INCLUDING $10.7 BILLION USED TO REPURCHASE 289 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TENDER OFFER, AND $1.7 BILLION OF CASH DIVIDENDS. WE ALSO

SPENT $3.6 BILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2007, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 64.3% COMPARED TO 46.5% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL FOR CONTINUING

OPERATIONS (COMPUTED ON THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS) WAS 13.9% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 16.8% FOR FISCAL 2006.

WE

BELIEVE THE SELECTED SALES DATA, THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NET SALES AND MAJOR CATEGORIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF

EACH OF THE ITEMS PRESENTED BELOW IS IMPORTANT IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE OPERATE IN ONE OPERATING SEGMENT AND BELIEVE THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN OUR MANAGEMENT'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

NET SALES

FISCAL 2007 CONSISTED OF 53 WEEKS COMPARED TO 52 WEEKS IN FISCAL 2006. NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2007 DECREASED 2.1%, OR $1.7 BILLION, TO $77.3 BILLION

FROM $79.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2007 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET SALES OF $3.7 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2007 FROM NEW STORES AND $1.1 BILLION OF NET SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN FISCAL 2007. COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 6.7% FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF

2.8% FOR FISCAL 2006.

THERE

WERE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINE. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS CONTINUED TO BE SOFT, ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF OUR

TRADITIONALLY STRONG MARKETS SUCH AS FLORIDA, CALIFORNIA AND THE NORTHEAST. WE SAW RELATIVE STRENGTH IN FLOORING, PLUMBING, GARDEN, AND PAINT AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN THESE AREAS WERE ABOVE THE

COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2007. WE GAINED MARKET SHARE IN POWER TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT, DUE IN PART TO OUR LAUNCH OF RYOBI ONE+ LITHIUM PRODUCTS IN FISCAL 2007. COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR LUMBER,

BUILDING MATERIALS, HARDWARE, LIGHTING, KITCHEN/BATH AND MILLWORK WERE BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR FISCAL 2007. THE COMBINATION OF SOFTNESS IN OUR BIG TICKET CATEGORIES AND COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AVERAGE TICKET, WHICH DECREASED 2.4% TO $57.48 FOR FISCAL 2007.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PERFORMED WELL IN FISCAL 2007. OUR MEXICAN STORES POSTED A DOUBLE DIGIT COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASE FOR FISCAL 2007, AND CANADA'S COMPARABLE STORE SALES WERE ALSO

POSITIVE.

IN

ORDER TO MEET OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE OBJECTIVES, WE STRATEGICALLY OPEN STORES NEAR MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES ("CANNIBALIZE") TO ENHANCE SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND

INCREASE MARKET PENETRATION. OUR NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR EXISTING STORES AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, WHICH HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY

1%.

WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR SALES PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN, AND COULD CONTINUE TO BE, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS MARKETS. DUE TO THE HIGHLY-FRAGMENTED U.S. HOME

IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY, IN WHICH WE ESTIMATE OUR MARKET SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY 15%, MEASURING THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS IS DIFFICULT.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT DECREASED 2.1% TO $26.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $26.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 33.6% FOR FISCAL 2007,

FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006. LOWER DEFERRED INTEREST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD FINANCING PROGRAMS PROVIDED A BENEFIT OF 39 BASIS POINTS TO GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES FOR FISCAL 2007. THROUGH OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD, WE OFFER NO INTEREST/NO PAYMENT PROGRAMS. THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. FOR

FISCAL 2007, THE PENETRATION OF OUR PRIVATE LABEL AND CO-BRANDED CREDIT SALES WAS 29.4% COMPARED TO 28.0% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE DEFERRED INTEREST BENEFIT WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER

PENETRATION OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS SUCH AS APPLIANCES AND MARKDOWNS TAKEN TO CLEAR THROUGH SOME SEASONAL ITEMS, SUCH AS OUTDOOR POWER EQUIPMENT AND GRILLS, AND TO ALLOW US TO TRANSITION INTO NEW

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ASSEMBLED CABINETS AND KITCHEN ACCESSORIES.

22

OPERATING EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 6.1% TO $18.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $17.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WERE 24.3% FOR

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 22.4% FOR FISCAL 2006.

SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A") INCREASED 5.9% TO $17.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $16.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 22.1% FOR

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 20.4% FOR FISCAL 2006. OUR DELEVERAGE IN SG&A REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, WHERE FOR EVERY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OF NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES,

WE EXPECT TO DELEVERAGE EXPENSES BY ABOUT 20 BASIS POINTS. ADDITIONALLY IN FISCAL 2007, OUR PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO WAS

$275 MILLION LESS THAN WHAT WE RECEIVED IN FISCAL 2006. WE ACCOUNT FOR PROFIT SHARING AS A REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZED $88 MILLION OF WRITE-OFFS

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FUTURE STORE LOCATIONS THAT WE DETERMINED WE WILL NOT OPEN AND $34 MILLION OF EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING OUR 11 HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES AND OUR TAMPA

CALL CENTER IN FISCAL 2007. SG&A ALSO REFLECTS INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN SUPPORT OF OUR FIVE KEY PRIORITIES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, TOTAL PAYROLL INCREASED BY 76 BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2007

OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS REFLECTS INVESTMENTS IN STORE LABOR AND OUR MASTER TRADE SPECIALISTS PROGRAM, THE IMPACT OF OUR SUCCESS SHARING BONUS PLANS, AS WELL AS THE NEGATIVE SALES

ENVIRONMENT. THE INCREASE IN SG&A FOR FISCAL 2007 OVER FISCAL 2006 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $129 MILLION OF EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2006.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 8.1% TO $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $1.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.2% FOR

FISCAL 2007 AND 2.0% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 18.3% TO $7.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM $8.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 9.4% FOR FISCAL

2007 COMPARED TO 11.2% FOR FISCAL 2006.

INTEREST, NET

IN FISCAL 2007, WE RECOGNIZED $622 MILLION OF NET INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO $364 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS

0.8% FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO 0.5% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCURRED RELATED TO THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE

SENIOR NOTES, $1.25 BILLION OF 5.25% SENIOR NOTES AND $3.0 BILLION OF 5.875% SENIOR NOTES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED TO 36.4% FOR FISCAL 2007 FROM 38.1% FOR FISCAL 2006. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE

INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2007 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF A ONE-TIME RETROACTIVE TAX ASSESSMENT RECEIVED FROM THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 AND TAX

BENEFITS RECOGNIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF SEVERAL STATE AUDITS AND COMPLETION OF THE FISCAL 2003 AND 2004 FEDERAL TAX AUDITS IN FISCAL 2007.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.27 FOR FISCAL 2007 AND $2.55 FOR FISCAL 2006. THE 53

RD

WEEK INCREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 FOR FISCAL 2007. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE

23

FAVORABLY

IMPACTED IN BOTH FISCAL 2007 AND 2006 BY THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR $40.0 BILLION REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. WE REPURCHASED 293 MILLION SHARES FOR

$10.8 BILLION IN FISCAL 2007 AND 174 MILLION SHARES FOR $6.7 BILLION IN FISCAL 2006. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 743 MILLION SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $27.2 BILLION. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, WE HAD $12.8 BILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONSIST OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH AUGUST 30, 2007 AND A LOSS ON THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. NET SALES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE

$7.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO $11.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, WERE $185 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, COMPARED TO

$495 MILLION FOR LAST YEAR. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2007 INCLUDE A $4 MILLION LOSS, NET OF TAX, RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 29, 2006 ("FISCAL 2005")

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2006 INCREASED 2.6%, OR $2.0 BILLION, TO $79.0 BILLION FROM $77.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. FISCAL 2006 NET SALES GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY NET SALES OF $4.0 BILLION FROM NEW STORES. COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 2.8% FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF 3.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES

WAS DRIVEN BY A 4.6% DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS OFFSET IN PART BY A 1.6% INCREASE IN AVERAGE TICKET. OUR AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED TO $58.90 FOR FISCAL 2006 AND INCREASED IN 8 OF

10 SELLING DEPARTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. RETAIL HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET AS WELL AS DIFFICULT

YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS DUE TO SALES ARISING FROM HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN FISCAL 2005. BOTH CANADA AND MEXICO EXPERIENCED POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2006.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES RESULTS REFLECT IN PART THE IMPACT OF CANNIBALIZATION. OUR NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR EXISTING STORES DURING FISCAL 2006, WHICH HAD A

NEGATIVE IMPACT TO COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 2%.

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 2.3% TO $26.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $25.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES DECREASED 9 BASIS POINTS

TO 33.6% FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 33.7% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE DECLINE IN GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES REFLECTS A CHANGING MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN APPLIANCES WHOSE

MARGIN RATE IS BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 4.7% TO $17.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $16.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WERE 22.4% FOR

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 21.9% FOR FISCAL 2005.

SG&A

INCREASED 4.0% TO $16.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $15.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 20.4% FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 20.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE

IN SG&A DURING FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE TO ADDED ASSOCIATE LABOR HOURS ON THE FLOOR OF OUR STORES, INCREASED SPENDING ON STORE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND THE EXPANSION OF MERCHANDISE DISPLAY RESETS. THIS

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SELF-INSURANCE COSTS AS WE CONTINUE TO REALIZE BENEFITS FROM SAFETY PROGRAMS AND OTHER INITIATIVES. ALSO IN FISCAL 2006, WE RECEIVED MORE BENEFITS

UNDER OUR PROFIT SHARING PROVISION WITH THE THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO THAN IN FISCAL 2005.

ALSO

IMPACTING OUR SG&A IN FISCAL 2006 WAS EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE OF $129 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS")

NO. 123(R),

24

"SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT" ("SFAS 123(R)"), WHEREBY WE RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION OF STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CONTINUED VESTING OF OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO FISCAL

2003. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN SG&A WAS $91 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND EXPENSE RELATED TO LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSING OF 20 EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IN

FISCAL 2005.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 11.6% TO $1.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $1.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 2.0% FOR

FISCAL 2006 AND 1.8% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DEPRECIATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 2.0% TO $8.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $9.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 11.2% FOR FISCAL

2006 AND 11.8% FOR FISCAL 2005.

INTEREST, NET

IN FISCAL 2006, WE RECOGNIZED $364 MILLION OF NET INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO $80 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.5%

FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 0.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCURRED RELATED TO THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE OF $1.0 BILLION OF 5.20% SENIOR NOTES AND

$3.0 BILLION OF 5.40% SENIOR NOTES AND THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES, $1.25 BILLION OF 5.25% SENIOR NOTES AND $3.0 BILLION OF

5.875% SENIOR NOTES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED TO 38.1% FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM 37.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF A RETROACTIVE TAX ASSESSMENT FROM THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, THE QUEBEC NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED

LEGISLATION THAT RETROACTIVELY CHANGED CERTAIN TAX LAWS THAT SUBJECTED US TO ADDITIONAL TAX AND INTEREST. AS A RESULT, WE RECEIVED AN

ASSESSMENT FROM QUEBEC FOR $57 MILLION IN RETROACTIVE TAX AND $12 MILLION IN RELATED INTEREST FOR THE 2002 THROUGH 2005 TAXABLE YEARS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $2.55 FOR FISCAL 2006 AND $2.63 FOR FISCAL 2005. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE FAVORABLY

IMPACTED IN BOTH FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005 BY THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2007, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $5.7 BILLION AS COMPARED

TO $7.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF DECREASED NET EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $4.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO $7.6 BILLION USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2006. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

$8.3 BILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 AND $4.3 BILLION LESS IN PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN FISCAL 2007. THE SALE OF HD

SUPPLY PRINCIPALLY RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS: RECEIVABLES, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, GOODWILL, OTHER ASSETS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED SALARIES AND RELATED

EXPENSES.

ADDITIONALLY

IN FISCAL 2007, WE SPENT $3.6 BILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: 56% FOR NEW STORES, 8% FOR STORE MODERNIZATION, 15% FOR TECHNOLOGY AND 21% FOR OTHER

INITIATIVES. OF THE

25

$3.6 BILLION

IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY $3.4 BILLION WAS FOR RETAIL OPERATIONS. IN FISCAL 2007, WE ADDED 110 NEW STORES, INCLUDING 10 RELOCATIONS.

NET

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2007 WAS $10.6 BILLION COMPARED WITH $203 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO $4.1 BILLION MORE IN COMMON STOCK SHARE REPURCHASES THAN LAST YEAR, INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF 289 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $10.7 BILLION IN CONNECTION WITH

OUR TENDER OFFER, ALONG WITH $8.9 BILLION LESS IN PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL 2007.

ON

JUNE 18, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A RECAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL $22.5 BILLION IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY

ON AUGUST 30, 2007 AND USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE AND CASH ON HAND TO REPURCHASE 289 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $10.7 BILLION, OR $37 PER SHARE, IN SETTLEMENT OF

A RELATED TENDER OFFER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, WE RETIRED 735 MILLION SHARES OF OUR TREASURY STOCK. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED

743 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $27.2 BILLION. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, $12.8 BILLION REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. WE ANTICIPATE

ISSUING DEBT TO COMPLETE THE REMAINDER OF OUR RECAPITALIZATION PLAN.

WE

HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.25 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR

BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION. AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THERE WAS $1.7 BILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE

RELATED CREDIT FACILITY. WE DO NOT FORESEE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS BEYOND THE $3.0 BILLION BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2010,

CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, ALL OF WHICH WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH. NONE OF THE COVENANTS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

WE

USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS

REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 64.3% COMPARED TO 46.5% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS THE

NET INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT AS A RESULT OF THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES, $1.25 BILLION OF 5.25% SENIOR NOTES AND

$3.0 BILLION OF 5.875% SENIOR NOTES.

AS

OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, WE HAD $457 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE

SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE

FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

DURING

FISCAL 2007, WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $2.0 BILLION THAT SWAP FIXED RATE INTEREST ON OUR $3.0 BILLION 5.40%

SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE RATE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 60 TO 149 BASIS POINTS THAT EXPIRE ON MARCH 1, 2016. AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS

AN ASSET OF $29 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE SIMILAR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES.

ALSO

DURING FISCAL 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $750 MILLION THAT SWAPS VARIABLE RATE INTEREST ON OUR

$750 MILLION FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES FOR FIXED RATE INTEREST AT 4.36% THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 16, 2009. AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THIS AGREEMENT WAS A

LIABILITY OF $17 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE WOULD HAVE PAID TO SETTLE SIMILAR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES.

(4)

EXCLUDES $602 MILLION OF NONCURRENT UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE FIN 48

LIABILITIES.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES, AS

WELL AS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE DEBT.

AS

OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $11.0 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, WERE

APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

27

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR

SALES RETURNS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR

ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE

CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE

OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. WE ALSO RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZE THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 89% VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY

METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER THE COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE THE HOME DEPOT, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL

INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL

VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE

EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED

UNDER THE COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007 OR 2006.

INDEPENDENT

PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A

STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY

OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK RESULTS

FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. ACTUAL SHRINK RESULTS DID NOT VARY

MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 OR 2005.

SELF-INSURANCE

WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITY

REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND

ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE

28

ESTIMATES

ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS, DIFFER FROM

OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS DID NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 OR 2005.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE

PROMOTION OF VENDORS' PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS

EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR

ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME

REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT

IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS' PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET

AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE EVALUATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN MANAGEMENT MAKES THE DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION, OR WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. A STORE'S ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, A PROVISION IS MADE TO WRITE DOWN THE RELATED ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE IF THE

CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE FAIR VALUE. WE MAKE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN COMPLETING IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES ARE

REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A

IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LOCATION CLOSES, WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

IN

FISCAL 2005, WE RECORDED $91 MILLION IN SG&A RELATED TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND ON-GOING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING 20 EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RECORDED $29 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN COST OF SALES IN FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO INVENTORY MARKDOWNS IN THESE STORES. WE ALSO RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS ON OTHER CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

29

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS"

("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. SFAS 157 APPLIES UNDER OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE FASB HAVING PREVIOUSLY CONCLUDED IN THOSE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT

FAIR VALUE IS THE RELEVANT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE. ACCORDINGLY, SFAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS 157 BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2007, AND WILL THEREFORE BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE HOME DEPOT IN FISCAL 2008. IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS 157 AS IT RELATES TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND

NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN AN ENTITY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS, HAS BEEN DEFERRED TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2008. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 IN FISCAL 2008 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME

DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE

BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND

REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINS THE

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY. BOTH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F)

PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL

OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 IN PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

FEBRUARY 3, 2008 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED ON PAGE 32 IN THIS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE HOME DEPOT INC.'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE HOME DEPOT INC.'S MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT

ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 AND JANUARY 28, 2007, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE "COMPANY") OPERATE THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES AVERAGING

APPROXIMATELY 105,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY 35,000 TO 45,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD

TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS, HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS, TRADESPEOPLE AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ("EXPO"), WHICH OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY RELATED TO DESIGN AND RENOVATION PROJECTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY WAS

OPERATING 2,234 STORES IN TOTAL, WHICH INCLUDED 1,950 THE HOME DEPOT STORES, 34 EXPO STORES, FIVE YARDBIRDS STORES AND TWO THD DESIGN CENTER STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE

TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND GUAM ("U.S."), 165 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CANADA, 66 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN MEXICO AND 12 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CHINA.

INFORMATION

RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED HD SUPPLY BUSINESS IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL YEAR

THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31. FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2008

("FISCAL 2007") INCLUDES 53 WEEKS AND FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 28, 2007 ("FISCAL 2006") AND JANUARY 29, 2006 ("FISCAL 2005") INCLUDE 52 WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE U.S. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM

MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION "SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS" IN THIS NOTE 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE

CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HIGH-GRADE COMMERCIAL PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

38

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGES THE COMPANY'S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND OWNS THE

RELATED RECEIVABLES. WE EVALUATED THE THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES HOLDING THE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAM AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R), "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES." THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER EXPIRES IN 2011,

WITH THE COMPANY HAVING THE OPTION, BUT NO OBLIGATION, TO PURCHASE THE RECEIVABLES AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT. THE DEFERRED INTEREST CHARGES INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS DEFERRED FINANCING

PROGRAMS OFFERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. THE INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE CUSTOMERS' USE OF THE CARDS AND THE PROFIT SHARING WITH THE THIRD-PARTY

ADMINISTRATOR ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A").

IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $57 MILLION AND

$1.8 BILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 AND JANUARY 28, 2007, RESPECTIVELY, A DECREASE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. THE COMPANY'S VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007 OR 2006.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL

INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN MEXICO AND CHINA, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS

DETERMINED BY THE COST

METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 11% OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH

QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER THE COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2007 OR 2006.

INDEPENDENT

PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK ON A

STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND

EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX BENEFITS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE

EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

39

THE

COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE

ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION

FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES FOR THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANY'S BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF

THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER. THE

COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED USING THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

LIFE

BUILDINGS

10-45 YEARS

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3-20 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

5-45 YEARS

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND AMORTIZES THESE COSTS USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH IS THREE TO SIX YEARS. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT

COSTS NOT MEETING THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS AND SALES TAX, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE LIABILITY FOR SALES

RETURNS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER

HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE

IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED

BASED UPON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION PATTERNS AND REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF GIFT CARDS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDEMPTION BY THE CUSTOMER IS REMOTE. DURING FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND

2005, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $36 MILLION, $33 MILLION AND $52 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. FISCAL 2005 WAS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME, AND THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED INCLUDES THE GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME RELATED TO GIFT CARDS SOLD SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE GIFT CARD PROGRAM. THIS INCOME IS RECORDED

AS OTHER INCOME AND IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AS A REDUCTION IN SG&A.

SERVICES REVENUE

NET SALES INCLUDE SERVICES REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION, HOME MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS. IN THESE PROGRAMS, THE CUSTOMER SELECTS AND

PURCHASES MATERIAL FOR A PROJECT AND THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S STORES. UNDER CERTAIN PROGRAMS, WHEN THE COMPANY

PROVIDES OR ARRANGES THE INSTALLATION OF A PROJECT AND THE SUBCONTRACTOR PROVIDES MATERIAL AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION, BOTH THE

40

MATERIAL

AND LABOR ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES REVENUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETE.

ALL

PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF SERVICES ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. SERVICES REVENUE WAS $3.5 BILLION,

$3.8 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. THE EXPECTED

ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL

DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES.

PREPAID ADVERTISING

TELEVISION AND RADIO ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS, ALONG WITH MEDIA PLACEMENT COSTS, ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT FIRST APPEARS. INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE

ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE $31 MILLION AND $44 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007 AND 2006 RELATING TO PREPAYMENTS OF PRODUCTION COSTS FOR PRINT AND

BROADCAST ADVERTISING AS WELL AS SPONSORSHIP PROMOTIONS.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE

PROMOTION OF VENDORS' PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS

EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES.

VOLUME

REBATES AND CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED

PRODUCT IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS' PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN

OFFSET AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, GROSS ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.2 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN

SG&A. ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES WERE $120 MILLION, $83 MILLION AND $50 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO

ADVERTISING EXPENSE IN SG&A.

COST OF SALES

COST OF SALES INCLUDES THE ACTUAL COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD AND SERVICES PERFORMED, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS TO THE COMPANY'S STORES, LOCATIONS OR

CUSTOMERS, THE OPERATING COST OF THE COMPANY'S SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

THE

COST OF HANDLING AND SHIPPING MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANY'S STORES, LOCATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE CUSTOMER IS CLASSIFIED AS SG&A. THE COST OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING, INCLUDING INTERNAL

COSTS AND PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES, CLASSIFIED AS SG&A WAS $571 MILLION, $545 MILLION AND $480 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

41

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF

GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANY'S IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS

WERE ESTIMATED USING THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

THE

COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE FROM 1 TO 20 YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 OR 2005.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN MANAGEMENT MAKES THE DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION, OR WHEN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. A STORE'S ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, A PROVISION IS MADE TO WRITE DOWN THE RELATED ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES

ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE

OBLIGATIONS, LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME.

IN

FISCAL 2005 THE COMPANY RECORDED $91 MILLION IN SG&A RELATED TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND ON-GOING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING 20 OF ITS EXPO STORES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED $29 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN COST OF SALES IN FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO INVENTORY MARKDOWNS IN THESE STORES. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS ON OTHER CLOSINGS

AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 3, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF RECORDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION" ("SFAS 123"). THE COMPANY SELECTED THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION AS DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 148,

"ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE," AND ACCORDINGLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED, MODIFIED OR

SETTLED AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ("ESPP") AFTER THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 30, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R), "SHARE-BASED PAYMENT" ("SFAS 123(R)"), USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, THE COMPANY

BEGAN EXPENSING UNVESTED OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO FISCAL 2003 IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING TO RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AWARDED SINCE THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123 IN FISCAL 2003. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123(R).

RESULTS OF PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED.

42

THE

PER SHARE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED DURING FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WAS $9.45, $11.88 AND $12.83, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS WAS DETERMINED AT THE

DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.

2.     DISPOSITION AND ACQUISITIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2007, THE COMPANY CLOSED THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $8.3 BILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FOR THE SALE OF HD SUPPLY AND RECOGNIZED A

$4 MILLION LOSS, NET OF TAX, ON THE SALE OF THE BUSINESS, SUBJECT TO THE FINALIZATION OF WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS. ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, THE COMPANY PURCHASED A 12.5% EQUITY

INTEREST IN THE NEWLY FORMED HD SUPPLY FOR $325 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

ALSO

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, THE COMPANY GUARANTEED A $1.0 BILLION SENIOR SECURED LOAN ("GUARANTEED LOAN") OF HD SUPPLY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE, WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION, IS RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND INCLUDED IN OTHER

LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THE GUARANTEED LOAN HAS A TERM OF FIVE YEARS AND THE COMPANY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UP TO $1.0 BILLION AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF

NON-PAYMENT BY HD SUPPLY. THE GUARANTEED LOAN IS COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN ASSETS OF HD SUPPLY.

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

3.     STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108

IN FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, "CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT

YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 ADDRESSES THE PROCESS OF QUANTIFYING PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 108 ALLOWED COMPANIES TO REPORT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CORRECTING IMMATERIAL PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL METHOD FOR EVALUATING

MISSTATEMENTS, BY ADJUSTING THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION RATHER THAN AMENDING PREVIOUSLY FILED REPORTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SAB 108, THE COMPANY ADJUSTED BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE ITEMS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER

THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANY OF THE PRIOR YEARS AFFECTED.

HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REQUESTED THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEW ITS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNDERTOOK THE

REVIEW WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL, AND IT HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW. THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF THE 2006 REVIEW WERE AS FOLLOWS.



ALL

OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE PERIOD FROM 2002 THROUGH THE PRESENT HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE THE GRANT WAS APPROVED BY

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AN OFFICER ACTING PURSUANT TO DELEGATED AUTHORITY. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT CORRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY AND WITHOUT SEPARATE

APPROVALS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS INCLUDED INADVERTENT OMISSIONS OF GRANTEES FROM LISTS THAT WERE APPROVED PREVIOUSLY AND MISCALCULATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO PARTICULAR EMPLOYEES ON

APPROVED LISTS.



ALL

OPTIONS GRANTED FROM DECEMBER 1, 2000 THROUGH THE END OF 2001 HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF A MEETING OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR SOME OTHER DATE SELECTED WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. THE FEBRUARY 2001 ANNUAL GRANT WAS NOT FINALLY ALLOCATED TO RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE GRANT WAS

APPROVED. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ALSO CORRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY AND WITHOUT SEPARATE APPROVALS AS IN THE PERIOD 2002 TO THE PRESENT.



FOR

ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS AND CERTAIN QUARTERLY OPTION GRANTS FROM 1981 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2000, THE STATED GRANT DATE WAS ROUTINELY EARLIER THAN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH THE

GRANTS WERE APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE, THE STOCK PRICE ON THE APPARENT APPROVAL DATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE ON THE STATED GRANT DATE. THE

BACKDATING OCCURRED FOR GRANTS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE COMPANY. MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE SINCE LEFT THE COMPANY, GENERALLY FOLLOWED A PRACTICE OF REVIEWING CLOSING PRICES FOR A PRIOR PERIOD AND

SELECTING A DATE WITH A LOW STOCK PRICE TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE OPTIONS TO EMPLOYEES ON LISTS OF GRANTEES SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.



THE

ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS IN 1994 THROUGH 2000, AS WELL AS MANY QUARTERLY GRANTS DURING THIS PERIOD, WERE NOT FINALLY ALLOCATED AMONG THE RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER

THE STATED GRANT DATE. BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF RECORDS PRIOR TO 1994, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ALLOCATIONS ALSO POSTDATED THE SELECTED GRANT DATES FROM 1981 THROUGH 1993. MOREOVER, FOR MANY OF THESE

ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY GRANTS FROM 1981 THROUGH DECEMBER 2000, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO

45

DETERMINE

WITH CERTAINTY WHEN THE GRANTS WERE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FINALLY, THE COMPANY'S STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ALSO RETROACTIVELY ADDED EMPLOYEES TO

LISTS OF APPROVED GRANTEES, OR CHANGED THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES, WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR A BOARD COMMITTEE, TO CORRECT ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS.



NUMEROUS

OPTION GRANTS TO RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES WERE MADE PURSUANT TO DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE UNDER DELAWARE LAW.



IN

NUMEROUS INSTANCES, AND PRIMARILY PRIOR TO 2003, BENEFICIARIES OF GRANTS WHO WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEM TO THE SEC FAILED TO DO SO IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.



THE

SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING BY ANY CURRENT MEMBER OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TEAM OR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THESE ERRORS, IT HAD UNRECORDED EXPENSE OVER THE AFFECTED PERIOD (1981 THROUGH 2005) OF $227 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING RELATED TAX ITEMS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 108, THE COMPANY DECREASED BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 BY $227 MILLION WITHIN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE STAFF OF THE SEC BEGAN IN JUNE 2006 AN INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HAS ALSO

REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO COOPERATE WITH THESE AGENCIES. WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECT OF THE STOCK OPTION ADJUSTMENT WAS MATERIAL, EITHER QUANTITATIVELY OR QUALITATIVELY, IN ANY OF THE YEARS COVERED BY THE REVIEW OF THESE ITEMS. IN REACHING

THAT DETERMINATION, THE FOLLOWING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES WERE CONSIDERED (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

RESPECTIVELY.

5.     DEBT

THE COMPANY HAS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.25 BILLION. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN FISCAL 2007 AND 2006

WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY HAS A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO

$3.0 BILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2010, CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $2.0 BILLION THAT SWAP FIXED

RATE INTEREST ON THE COMPANY'S $3.0 BILLION 5.40% SENIOR NOTES FOR VARIABLE RATE INTEREST EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 60 TO 149 BASIS POINTS THAT EXPIRE ON MARCH 1, 2016. AT FEBRUARY 3,

2008, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS AN ASSET OF $29 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED TO SETTLE SIMILAR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES.

AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING AN INTEREST RATE SWAP, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $750 MILLION THAT SWAPS VARIABLE RATE INTEREST ON

THE COMPANY'S $750 MILLION FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES FOR FIXED RATE INTEREST AT 4.36% THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 16, 2009. AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE OF THIS

AGREEMENT WAS A LIABILITY OF $17 MILLION, WHICH IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE PAID TO SETTLE SIMILAR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AT CURRENT INTEREST RATES.

IN

DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED $750 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16, 2009 AT PAR VALUE, $1.25 BILLION OF 5.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16,

2013 AT A DISCOUNT OF $7 MILLION AND $3.0 BILLION OF 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16, 2036 AT A DISCOUNT OF $42 MILLION, TOGETHER THE "DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE." THE NET

PROCEEDS OF THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO FUND, IN PART, THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE

$49 MILLION DISCOUNT AND $37 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

ADDITIONALLY

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE

MARCH 1, 2016 AT A DISCOUNT OF $15 MILLION, TOGETHER THE "MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE." THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO PAY FOR THE ACQUISITION PRICE OF HUGHES

$19 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

ADDITIONALLY

IN MARCH 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE

INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2016. UPON ISSUANCE OF THE HEDGED DEBT, THE COMPANY SETTLED ITS FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENTS AND RECORDED A $12 MILLION DECREASE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED

DEBT.

IN

AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 4.625% NOTES DUE AUGUST 15, 2010 ("AUGUST 2005 ISSUANCE") AT A DISCOUNT OF $5 MILLION. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $995 MILLION

WERE USED TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE ACQUISITION PRICE OF NATIONAL WATERWORKS, INC. THE $5 MILLION DISCOUNT AND $7 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUGUST 2005

ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAD $1.0 BILLION OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO WITH THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE, MARCH

2006 ISSUANCE AND AUGUST 2005 ISSUANCE AS "SENIOR NOTES." THE SENIOR NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST UP TO THE

REDEMPTION DATE. THE REDEMPTION PRICE IS EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (1) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED, OR (2) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE

REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TO MATURITY. ADDITIONALLY, IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS, AS DEFINED BY THE TERMS OF THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE, HOLDERS OF THE

DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REDEEM THOSE NOTES AT 101% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST UP TO THE REDEMPTION DATE.

THE

COMPANY IS GENERALLY NOT LIMITED UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES IN ITS ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR SPECIFIED LEVELS OF NET

WORTH OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

INTEREST

EXPENSE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS IS NET OF INTEREST CAPITALIZED OF $46 MILLION, $47 MILLION AND $51 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

2011, $23 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2012 AND $7.5 BILLION THEREAFTER.

AS

OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SENIOR NOTES WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL OTHER LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, EXCLUDING CAPITAL

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $307 MILLION COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF $302 MILLION. THESE FAIR VALUES WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS BASED ON THE

COMPANY'S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN

FUTURE PERIODS AND, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES DISCUSSED BELOW, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. AS A RESULT

51

OF

DISPOSITION OF HD SUPPLY, $139 MILLION OF NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER.

AT

FEBRUARY 3, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AVAILABLE TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES FROM 2010 TO 2027. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSSES ARE IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE

EXPIRATION PERIOD IS TOO SHORT TO BE ASSURED OF UTILIZATION. THEREFORE, A $7 MILLION VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET RELATED TO NET OPERATING LOSSES TO AN

AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008 WERE $7 MILLION.

AS

A RESULT OF ITS SALE OF HD SUPPLY, THE COMPANY INCURRED A TAX LOSS, RESULTING IN A NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER OF APPROXIMATELY $159 MILLION. THE TAX LOSS ON SALE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE

COMPANY'S TAX BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS BOOK INVESTMENT IN HD SUPPLY. THE NET CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL EXPIRE IN 2012. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX

BENEFITS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL LOSS CARRYOVER WILL BE REALIZED BASED ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADEQUATE CAPITAL GAIN INCOME DURING THE CARRYOVER PERIOD. THEREFORE, NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN

PROVIDED.

THE

COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY

REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER,

UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE

COMPANY'S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY UNDER AUDIT BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THESE AUDITS GENERALLY INCLUDE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS

AND THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. IN 2005, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ("IRS") COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL

YEARS 2001 AND 2002. DURING 2007, THE IRS ALSO COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AND 2004 INCOME TAX RETURNS. CERTAIN ISSUES RELATING TO THE EXAMINATIONS OF FISCAL YEARS 2001

THROUGH 2004 ARE UNDER APPEAL, BUT ONLY YEARS AFTER FISCAL 2004 REMAIN SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION. THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY AUDITING THE MEXICAN OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES' FISCAL YEAR 2005

RETURNS, ALTHOUGH YEARS AFTER 2001 REMAIN SUBJECT TO AUDIT. THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS PROVINCES, ARE CURRENTLY AUDITING INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2001 THROUGH 2005. THERE ARE

ALSO U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AUDITS COVERING TAX YEARS 2001 TO 2005. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESULTS FROM ANY INCOME TAX AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109"

("FIN 48"). AMONG OTHER THINGS, FIN 48 REQUIRES APPLICATION OF A "MORE LIKELY THAN NOT" THRESHOLD TO THE RECOGNITION AND DERECOGNITION OF TAX POSITIONS. IT FURTHER REQUIRES THAT A CHANGE

IN JUDGMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS' TAX POSITIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTER OF SUCH CHANGE. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 REDUCED THE COMPANY'S RETAINED EARNINGS BY $111 MILLION. AS A RESULT

OF THE IMPLEMENTATION, THE GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT JANUARY 29, 2007 FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $667 MILLION. A RECONCILIATION OF THE

52

BEGINNING

AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS AS FOLLOWS (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS).

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 INCLUDES $368 MILLION OF NET UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

DURING

FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS INTEREST ACCRUAL ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION AND PAID INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION. TOTAL

ACCRUED INTEREST AS OF FEBRUARY 3, 2008 IS $140 MILLION. THERE WERE NO PENALTY ACCRUALS DURING FISCAL 2007. INTEREST AND

PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OPERATING EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CLASSIFICATION OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES DID NOT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTMENTS UNDER APPEAL FOR THE COMPLETED IRS AND CANADA AUDITS, AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AUDITS, WILL BE AGREED UPON WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE IRS

ISSUES GENERALLY CONCERN THE USEFUL LIFE OF ASSETS AND RELEVANT TRANSFER PRICING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS PROVIDED TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THE CANADA ISSUES GENERALLY CONCERN THE RELEVANT TRANSFER PRICING

FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS PROVIDED FROM THE U.S. STATE ISSUES GENERALLY CONCERN RELATED PARTY EXPENSE ADD-BACK PROVISIONS AND FORCED COMBINATION FILINGS. THE COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED

APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION OF THE RESERVE FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A SHORT-TERM LIABILITY IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A REASONABLE

POSSIBILITY THAT THE COMPANY MAY RESOLVE THE QUEBEC ASSESSMENT FROM PRIOR YEARS, WHICH TOTALED $65 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 3, 2008, WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE

AUDIT ISSUES MAY RESULT IN PAYMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS THAN THESE AMOUNTS, BUT THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

7.     EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. 2005 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN ("2005 PLAN") AND THE HOME DEPOT, INC. 1997 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN ("1997 PLAN" AND COLLECTIVELY WITH

RESTRICTED STOCK LAPSING UPON THE EARLIER OF THE ASSOCIATE'S ATTAINMENT OF AGE 60 OR THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY DATE. THE RESTRICTED STOCK ALSO INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE SHARES, THE PAYOUT OF

WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY'S TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS RETURN PERCENTILE RANKING COMPARED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES INCLUDED IN THE S&P 500 INDEX AT THE END OF THE

THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN AWARDS MAY BECOME NON-FORFEITABLE UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF AGE 60, PROVIDED THE ASSOCIATE HAS HAD FIVE YEARS OF

CONTINUOUS SERVICE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK IS EXPENSED OVER THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE. THE COMPANY RECORDED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED

STOCK OF $122 MILLION, $95 MILLION AND $32 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THERE WERE 593,000, 417,000 AND 461,000 DEFERRED SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, GRANTED UNDER THE PLANS. EACH DEFERRED SHARE ENTITLES THE ASSOCIATE TO ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS TWO ESPPS (U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS). THE PLAN FOR U.S. ASSOCIATES IS A TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN UNDER SECTION 423 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE

NON-U.S. PLAN IS NOT A SECTION 423 PLAN. THE ESPPS ALLOW ASSOCIATES TO PURCHASE UP TO 152 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH 128 MILLION SHARES HAVE BEEN

PURCHASED FROM INCEPTION OF THE PLANS. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES UNDER THE ESPPS IS EQUAL TO 85% OF THE STOCK'S FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE PURCHASE PERIOD. DURING FISCAL 2007, THERE

8.     LEASES

THE COMPANY LEASES CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFICE SPACE, WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION SPACE, EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. WHILE MOST OF THE LEASES ARE OPERATING LEASES, CERTAIN

LOCATIONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE LEASED UNDER CAPITAL LEASES. AS LEASES EXPIRE, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CERTAIN LEASES WILL BE RENEWED OR REPLACED.

CERTAIN

LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ESCALATING RENTS OVER THE LEASE TERMS. THE COMPANY EXPENSES RENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE WHICH COMMENCES ON THE DATE THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE PROPERTY. THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE CUMULATIVE PAYMENTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED

EXPENSES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE

COMPANY HAS A LEASE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY LEASES CERTAIN ASSETS TOTALING $282 MILLION. THIS LEASE WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED UNDER A STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND INVOLVES

TWO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY FINANCED A PORTION OF ITS NEW STORES OPENED IN FISCAL YEARS 1997 THROUGH 2003 UNDER THIS LEASE AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE LESSOR PURCHASED THE

PROPERTIES, PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY LEASED THE FACILITIES TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY RECORDS THE RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS AS SG&A IN

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE

$282 MILLION LEASE AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN FISCAL 2008 WITH NO RENEWAL OPTION. THE LEASE PROVIDES FOR A SUBSTANTIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE LIMITED TO 79% OF THE INITIAL BOOK VALUE OF THE

ASSETS AND INCLUDES A PURCHASE OPTION AT THE ORIGINAL COST OF EACH PROPERTY. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE THE ASSETS UNDER THIS LEASE FOR

$282 MILLION AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM IN FISCAL 2008.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REVISED VERSION OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R), "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46

REQUIRES CONSOLIDATION OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY IF A COMPANY'S VARIABLE INTEREST ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED LOSSES OR RECEIVES A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS, OR BOTH. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE ONE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES THAT, BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 46, MET

THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-CONSOLIDATION. THE SECOND SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY THAT OWNS THE ASSETS LEASED BY THE COMPANY TOTALING $282 MILLION IS NOT OWNED BY OR AFFILIATED WITH THE

COMPANY, ITS MANAGEMENT OR ITS OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO FIN 46, THE COMPANY WAS NOT DEEMED TO HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST, AND THEREFORE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THIS ENTITY.

FIN 46

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MEASURE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS, WHICH AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IF FIN 46 HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE

TRANSACTION. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED LONG-TERM DEBT OF $282 MILLION AND LONG-TERM NOTES RECEIVABLE OF

$282 MILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE LIABILITY WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS IT IS DUE IN FISCAL 2008. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECORD THE RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS AS SG&A IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 HAD NO ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE
