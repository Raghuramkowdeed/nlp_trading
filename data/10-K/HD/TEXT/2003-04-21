RETAIL BUSINESSES

HOME DEPOT STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY OF HOME DEPOT IS TO OFFER A BROAD

ASSORTMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES USING

HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE, SERVICE-ORIENTED PERSONNEL AND AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISING. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT

TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR MARKETING APPROACH AND OUR

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. WE REGULARLY CHECK OUR COMPETITORS'

PRICES TO ENSURE THAT OUR PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH MARKET.

CUSTOMERS. HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.

-        DO-IT-YOURSELF ("D-I-Y") CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE THEIR

OWN PROJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS. TO COMPLEMENT THE IN-STORE

EXPERTISE OF OUR ASSOCIATES, HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER MANY

D-I-Y "HOW-TO" CLINICS TAUGHT BY ASSOCIATES AND MERCHANDISE

VENDORS.

3

-        DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M") CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE

TYPICALLY HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASE MATERIALS THEMSELVES AND

HIRE THIRD PARTIES TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND/OR

INSTALLATION. WE OFFER THESE CUSTOMERS INSTALLATION SERVICES

FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS.

-        PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS: THESE CUSTOMERS ARE PROFESSIONAL

REMODELERS, GENERAL CONTRACTORS, REPAIRMEN AND TRADESMEN. IN

MANY STORES WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO THESE

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DELIVERY AND

WILL-CALL SERVICES, DEDICATED STAFF, EXTENSIVE MERCHANDISE

SELECTIONS AND EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS, ALL OF WHICH WE

BELIEVE INCREASE SALES.

PRODUCTS. A TYPICAL HOME DEPOT STORE STOCKS APPROXIMATELY 40,000 TO 50,000

PRODUCTS DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING BOTH NATIONAL BRAND NAME AND PROPRIETARY

ITEMS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES OF EACH MAJOR

PRODUCT GROUP (AND RELATED SERVICES) FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.

=====        =====        =====

WE BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE ARE

NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE VENDOR. MOST OF OUR MERCHANDISE IS PURCHASED

DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS, WHICH ELIMINATES "MIDDLEMAN" COSTS. WE BELIEVE

THAT COMPETITIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IN HOME DEPOT STORES.

WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SOURCING MERCHANDISE PROGRAM TO SOURCE HIGH-QUALITY

PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OVERSEAS MANUFACTURERS, WHICH GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS A

BROADER SELECTION OF PRODUCTS AND BETTER VALUES WHILE ENHANCING OUR GROSS

MARGIN. OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANTS TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY TO IDENTIFY

OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE ITEMS DIRECTLY FOR OUR STORES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE

OPENED TWO SOURCING OFFICES LOCATED IN SHANGHAI AND SHENZHEN, CHINA, AND HAVE A

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MERCHANT LOCATED IN BONN, GERMANY. THESE INITIATIVES ENABLE

US TO IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY, TO IMPORT PRODUCTS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO

OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER PRODUCTS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE

AVAILABLE IF PURCHASED FROM THIRD-PARTY IMPORTERS. WE CURRENTLY SOURCE PRODUCTS

FROM MORE THAN 500 FACTORIES IN APPROXIMATELY 40 COUNTRIES.

TO COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR CURRENT PRODUCT SELECTION, WE HAVE FORMED

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO

MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. AT THE END OF

FISCAL YEAR 2002, WE OFFERED A NUMBER OF PROPRIETARY AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, JOHN DEERE(R) LAWN AND GARDEN TRACTORS;

THOMASVILLE(R) KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINETS; SILESTONE(R) COUNTERTOPS;

RIDGID(R) POWER TOOLS; BEHR PREMIUM PLUS(R) PAINT; MILL'S PRIDE(R) CABINETS;

HUSKY(R) HAND TOOLS; GE SMARTWATER(TM) WATER HEATERS; PHILIPS(R) LIGHT BULBS;

TORO(R) LAWN MOWERS; VIGORO(R) LAWN CARE PRODUCTS GAF(R) ROOFING PRODUCTS,

HONDA(R) LAWN MOWERS AND LITHONIA LIGHTING(TM) FLUORESCENT LIGHTING PRODUCTS.

IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ALIGNMENTS WITH OTHER

SUPPLIERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF

PRODUCTS AVAILABLE UNDER BRAND NAMES THAT ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE HOME DEPOT.

4

AT-HOME SERVICES. HOME DEPOT STORES OFFER A VARIETY OF INSTALLED SALES AND HOME

MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH ITS AT-HOME SERVICES(R) BUSINESS. THIS SERVICE

TARGETS THE DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMER WHO WILL SELECT AND PURCHASE MATERIALS FOR A

PROJECT AND PREFERS THE COMPANY TO ARRANGE PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. WE

IMPLEMENT OUR INSTALLED SALES PROGRAMS THROUGH INDEPENDENT QUALIFIED

CONTRACTORS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO. THESE

PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES, SUCH

AS CARPETING, HARD FLOORING, CABINETS AND SOLID SURFACE COUNTERTOPS, AS WELL AS

THE INSTALLATION BY STRATEGIC PARTNERS OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS ROOFING, GENERATORS

AND FURNACE AND CENTRAL AIR SYSTEMS.

STORE-RELATED PROGRAMS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR BUSINESS TO FIND

OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY, THEREBY INCREASING SALES.

ACCORDINGLY, WE IMPLEMENTED OR EXPANDED A NUMBER OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES IN

HOME DEPOT STORES AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT SUPPORTING STORE OPERATIONS DURING

FISCAL 2002, INCLUDING.

-        PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMER INITIATIVE. WE ARE COMMITTED

TO BEING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING REMODELERS, CARPENTERS, PLUMBERS,

PAINTERS, ELECTRICIANS, BUILDING MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS

AND DESIGNERS. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR

"PRO" INITIATIVE, WHICH ADDS SERVICE-RELATED PROGRAMS TO OUR

STORES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES TO PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS. STORES PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM HAVE ADDED

ASSOCIATES AT A SALES DESK DEDICATED TO PROVIDING MORE

PERSONALIZED SERVICE TO PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

MANAGING ACCOUNTS AND TAKING AND FILLING ORDERS FOR PICK-UP

OR DELIVERY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE HOURS WHEN

PROFESSIONALS TYPICALLY SHOP, THESE STORES HAVE ASSIGNED

SALES ASSOCIATES IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO ASSIST THESE

CUSTOMERS. TO BETTER SERVE OUR PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS, WE

HAVE ALSO INCREASED QUANTITIES OF EXISTING PRODUCTS TYPICALLY

PURCHASED BY PROFESSIONALS IN BULK QUANTITIES, AND WE OFFER

CERTAIN ITEMS IN EACH DEPARTMENT PACKAGED IN BULK TO OFFER

ADDITIONAL SAVINGS. WHILE AIMED AT THE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER,

THIS PROGRAM ALSO ENABLES US TO BETTER SERVE OUR D-I-Y

CUSTOMER WITH IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE, INCLUDING DELIVERY

AND WILL-CALL SERVICES, EXPANDED CREDIT PROGRAMS AND

ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE. THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE, WE HAVE

IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES IN SERVING OUR PROFESSIONAL

CUSTOMERS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN MANY OF OUR STORES

WITHOUT MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS. BY THE END OF FISCAL 2002,

WE HAD EXPANDED THE PRO INITIATIVE INTO 1,135 STORES, 600 OF

WHICH WERE ADDED DURING THE YEAR. WE ANTICIPATE THAT DURING

FISCAL 2003, WE WILL EXPAND THIS INITIATIVE TO MORE THAN 204

ADDITIONAL STORES.

-        SPI PROGRAM. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE IMPLEMENTED THE SERVICE

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OR "SPI" PROGRAM IN ALL OF OUR NEW

STORES. THROUGH THE PROGRAM, CERTAIN ASSOCIATES ARE ASSIGNED

SPECIFIC TASKS, ALLOWING OTHERS TO FOCUS ON ASSISTING

CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE SCHEDULE ASSOCIATES TO RECEIVE

SHIPMENTS AND STOCK MERCHANDISE WHEN OUR STORES ARE CLOSED OR

DURING HOURS WHEN THEY HAVE FEWER CUSTOMERS.

-        APPLIANCE SALES. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE CONTINUED THE

ROLL-OUT OF OUR APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO OUR STORES IN THE

U.S. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WE SELL APPLIANCES MANUFACTURED BY

GENERAL ELECTRIC(R), MAYTAG(R) AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS

THROUGH 1,500 TO 2,000 FEET OF DEDICATED APPLIANCE SELLING

SPACE IN SELECTED STORES. WE DISPLAY AND STOCK THE MORE

POPULAR APPLIANCES IN OUR STORES AND OFFER THE ABILITY TO

SPECIAL ORDER OVER 2,300 ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THROUGH COMPUTER

KIOSKS LOCATED IN THE STORES. THROUGH THE COMPUTER KIOSKS WE

CAN CHECK INVENTORY AND ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER

DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS SOON AS 48 HOURS AFTER THE

ORDER IS PLACED. 743 OF OUR STORES HAD APPLIANCE SHOWROOMS AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2002, AND WE ANTICIPATE ADDING THE

APPLIANCE SALES PROGRAM TO AN ADDITIONAL 671 STORES BY THE

END OF FISCAL 2003.

5

-        DESIGNPLACE INITIATIVE. WE CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT OUR

DESIGNPLACE INITIATIVE DURING FISCAL 2002, ROLLING THE

INITIATIVE OUT TO AN ADDITIONAL 668 STORES. THE INITIATIVE

OFFERS AN ENHANCED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO OUR DESIGN AND

DECOR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING PERSONALIZED SERVICE FROM

SPECIALLY TRAINED ASSOCIATES AND ENHANCED MERCHANDISE

SELECTION IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING. WE EXPECT TO ADD THE

DESIGNPLACE INITIATIVE TO AN ADDITIONAL 556 STORES DURING

FISCAL 2003.

-        TOOL RENTAL. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO SATISFY A BROAD RANGE

OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL AND D-I-Y CUSTOMERS, WE

OFFER A TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN CERTAIN STORES. UNDER THIS

PROGRAM, WE RENT APPROXIMATELY 200 COMMERCIAL-QUALITY TOOLS

IN TEN CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SAWS, FLOOR SANDERS, GENERATORS,

GAS POWERED LAWN EQUIPMENT AND PLUMBING TOOLS. CUSTOMERS CAN

RENT THE TOOLS ON AN HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS.

OUR ASSOCIATES WHO WORK IN THE TOOL RENTAL AREA RECEIVE

SPECIAL TRAINING IN THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TOOLS. AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE OFFERED TOOL RENTAL SERVICE IN 601

STORES COMPARED TO 466 STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2001. BY

THE END OF FISCAL 2003, WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TOOL RENTAL

SERVICES IN APPROXIMATELY 800 STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT

OFFERING THIS SERVICE INCREASES THE SALES OF RELATED

MERCHANDISE WITHOUT REDUCING THE SALES OF EQUIPMENT SIMILAR

TO THAT AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL.

-        CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE BEGAN TESTING

THE USE OF A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER TO ASSIST WITH

EXPEDITING SPECIAL ORDERS AND MANAGING INSTALLATION PROJECTS.

THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER ALSO SUPPORTS THE SALE AND

INSTALLATION OF WATER HEATERS AND HVAC EQUIPMENT NATIONWIDE.

CALLS COME INTO THE CENTER WHERE CUSTOMER SERVICE

REPRESENTATIVES ASSIST CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCT SELECTION AND

SCHEDULING INSTALLATIONS. THE ORDERS ARE THEN FULFILLED

THROUGH OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CUSTOMER CONTACT

CENTER WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOTH

IN OUR STORES AND ON THE PHONE, WHILE REDUCING COSTS. WE

ANTICIPATE CONTINUING THIS TEST DURING FISCAL 2003.

-        CUSTOMER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE OFFER SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO

ENHANCE THE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR D-I-Y CUSTOMERS. OUR

ASSOCIATES AND VENDORS TEACH "HOW-TO" CLINICS THAT FOCUS ON

D-I-Y PROJECTS, SUCH AS INSTALLING GARBAGE DISPOSALS, LAYING

PATIO PAVERS OR BUILDING A DECK. IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICS,

WE OFFER HOME DEPOT UNIVERSITY(SM), WHICH PRESENTS FOUR-WEEK

MODULES ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEVERAL FACETS

OF A HOME IMPROVEMENT TOPIC. FOR EXAMPLE, A ROOM ENHANCEMENT

MODULE MAY PROVIDE INSTRUCTION ON PAINT, WALLPAPER AND WINDOW

TREATMENTS. THROUGH THE HOME DEPOT'S KIDS WORKSHOP(SM)

PROGRAM, CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN TOOL SAFETY AND COMPLETE A

SMALL BUILDING PROJECT, SUCH AS A BIRDHOUSE OR TOOL BOX. WE

BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCREASE OUR

SALES BY ENCOURAGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERTAKE MORE PROJECTS,

DIFFERENTIATING US FROM OUR COMPETITION AND REINFORCING OUR

POSITION AS EXPERTS IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

STORE GROWTH

UNITED STATES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE WERE OPERATING 1,370 HOME DEPOT

STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE

OPENED 167 NEW HOME DEPOT STORES IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THESE NEW STORE OPENINGS

OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN EXISTING MARKETS, WE CONTINUED OUR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION

BY OPENING STORES IN A NUMBER OF NEW MARKETS.

TO INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND ENHANCE

LONG-TERM MARKET PENETRATION, WE OFTEN OPEN NEW STORES NEAR THE EDGE OF MARKET

AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES. WHILE THESE OPENINGS MAY INITIALLY HAVE A

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMPARABLE STORE-FOR-STORE SALES, WE BELIEVE THIS

"CANNIBALIZATION" STRATEGY INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND OVERALL MARKET

SHARE BY REDUCING DELAYS IN SHOPPING, INCREASING UTILIZATION BY EXISTING

CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS TO MORE

6

CONVENIENT LOCATIONS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE BELIEVE THAT APPROXIMATELY

21% OF OUR STORES WERE CANNIBALIZED BY CERTAIN NEW STORES.

CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE WERE OPERATING 89 HOME DEPOT STORES IN

SEVEN CANADIAN PROVINCES. OF THESE STORES, 11 WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2002.

MEXICO. IN JUNE 2002, WE PURCHASED THE ASSETS OF MADERERIA DEL NORTE, A

FOUR-STORE CHAIN OF HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES IN JUAREZ, MEXICO. AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2002, WE WERE OPERATING 12 STORES IN MEXICO.

HOME DEPOT URBAN STORES

WE OPENED OUR FIRST TWO URBAN STORES IN FISCAL 2002. THE FIRST OPENED IN

BROOKLYN WITH APPROXIMATELY 61,000 SQUARE FEET AND THE SECOND OPENED IN STATEN

ISLAND WITH APPROXIMATELY 79,000 SQUARE FEET. THESE STORES WILL CARRY

APPROXIMATELY 20,000 ITEMS, WHICH ARE SELECTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH THE STORE IS LOCATED. WE PLAN TO OPEN TWO OTHER URBAN

STORES IN FISCAL 2003. WE ARE CONTINUING TO ANALYZE OTHER URBAN AND

HIGH-DENSITY SUBURBAN MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR ADDITIONAL SITES TO

TEST THIS SMALLER STORE CONCEPT.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

OPERATING STRATEGY. THE OPERATING STRATEGY BEHIND OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES

IS TO BE A COMPLETE HOME DECORATING AND REMODELING RESOURCE. EACH OF THESE

STORES OFFERS 10 SPECIALTY BUSINESSES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FEATURES DESIGN

SHOWROOMS WITH FULL-SIZE DISPLAYS TO HELP CUSTOMERS VISUALIZE THE END RESULT OF

POSSIBLE INTERIOR DESIGN PROJECTS. TO ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO OFFER

COMPLETE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, WE EMPLOY

ASSOCIATES WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN DESIGNING, PLANNING AND COMPLETING DECORATING

AND REMODELING PROJECTS.

CUSTOMERS. TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ARE MIDDLE TO

UPPER INCOME D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS, WHO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE FOR INSTALLATION BY

OTHERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE OFFER INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE PRODUCTS WE

SELL AT THESE STORES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR TRADE CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY CUSTOM

BUILDERS, REMODELERS, DESIGNERS AND ARCHITECTS.

PRODUCTS. EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER INTERIOR DESIGN PRODUCTS AND

INSTALLATION SERVICES FOR KITCHENS, BATHS AND APPLIANCES, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS

FOR LIGHTING, DECORATING AND STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PROJECTS.

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF MERCHANDISE IN AN EFFORT TO

MEET THE NEEDS OF SHOPPERS WHOSE INTERIOR DESIGN PREFERENCES MAY GO BEYOND THE

ITEMS AVAILABLE IN A HOME DEPOT STORE. WHILE THERE IS MINIMAL OVERLAP BETWEEN

THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN HOME DEPOT STORES AND EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, THOSE

PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES REPRESENT A BROADER AND MORE

UNIQUE ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN ADDITION TO NATIONALLY ADVERTISED BRAND

NAME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO OFFER ITEMS THAT MUST BE SPECIAL ORDERED OR THAT ARE

TYPICALLY OFFERED THROUGH SHOWROOMS OPEN ONLY TO DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.

IN-STORE SERVICES. WE HAVE ASSOCIATES AT OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES TO

ASSIST WITH EVERY PHASE OF A PROJECT. CERTIFIED KITCHEN AND BATH DESIGNERS ARE

ON STAFF, AS WELL AS DESIGN PROFESSIONALS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS DESIGN

LIGHTING, TILE AND FLOORING, CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY AND BEDDING, CUSTOM CLOSETS AND

WINDOW TREATMENTS. INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR MOST PRODUCTS AT

EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, INCLUDING KITCHENS, BATHS, FLOORING, WALLPAPER,

TILE, LIGHTING FIXTURES AND WINDOW TREATMENTS. OUR PROJECT MANAGERS ENSURE THAT

THE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN SCHEDULE LICENSED THIRD PARTY

7

CONTRACTORS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. WE ALSO OFFER SPECIAL TRADE SERVICES, SUCH AS

DEDICATED OUTSIDE SALES PEOPLE AND DESIGNERS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO HELPING

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

STORE GROWTH. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE WERE OPERATING 52 EXPO DESIGN

CENTER STORES, 11 OF WHICH WERE OPENED DURING 2002. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE

OPENING TWO ADDITIONAL EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES IN 2003. THESE NEW STORES ARE

EXPECTED TO AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 90,000 SQUARE FEET AND WILL INCORPORATE A

SHOWROOM ENVIRONMENT.

WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO OPEN TOTAL OF 206 STORES DURING FISCAL 2003, INCLUDING

HOME DEPOT STORES, EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES AND OTHER FORMATS.

ACQUISITION OF GEORGIA LIGHTING HAS ALLOWED US TO STRENGTHEN OUR SOURCING,

CENTER STORES. IN FISCAL 2003, GEORGIA LIGHTING WILL TRANSFER ITS RETAIL

OPERATIONS TO EXPO DESIGN CENTER AND ITS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS TO YOUR

THEIR ABILITY TO BE DELIVERED VIA UNITED PARCEL SERVICE(R) AND FEDEX(R).

DURING FISCAL 2002, WE ENHANCED THE CONTENT OF THE WEBSITE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

AT-HOME SERVICES DIVISION TO DESCRIBE EACH OF THE SERVICES OFFERED AND ADDED

THE CAPABILITY TO ALLOW POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO CONVENIENTLY SIGN UP ONLINE FOR

IN-HOME CONSULTATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND

CANADIAN CUSTOMERS. THE SITE IS INFORMATIONAL ONLY AND PROVIDES INFORMATION ON

THE HOME DEPOT, A STORE LOCATOR, AS WELL AS A LINK TO WWW.HOMEDEPOT.COM. THE

WEBSITE IS BILINGUAL (ENGLISH AND FRENCH) TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS IN CANADA'S

TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES.

STORE SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. DURING FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS FOCUS

ON THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF OUR GROWING BUSINESS AND FAMILY OF

COMPANIES. CURRENTLY WE PROVIDE BUSINESS INFORMATION THROUGH EXTENSIVE

FAULT-TOLERANT, HIGH-SPEED NETWORKS AND THROUGH AN ARRAY OF APPROXIMATELY

135,000 PERSONAL COMPUTERS, 7,000 SERVERS AND 125,000 OTHER NETWORK-CONNECTED

DEVICES. THESE SYSTEMS PROVIDE STORE, CORPORATE, FINANCIAL, MERCHANDISING AND

OTHER BACK OFFICE FUNCTION SUPPORT.

DURING FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY BEGAN THE INSTALLATION OF SELF-CHECKOUT

SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS A TOTAL REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADE OF OUR POS SYSTEMS. IN

ADDITION, STORE MANAGERS RECEIVED NEW TOOLS FOR LABOR PLANNING, STAFFING,

SCHEDULING AND WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT TO BETTER ALLOCATE ASSOCIATES TO SUPPORT

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IMPROVE EXECUTION OF IN-STORE INITIATIVES. THE COMPANY

ALSO DEPLOYED AUTOMATED TOOLS TO ASSIST OUR MERCHANTS WITH ASSORTMENT PLANNING,

PRICING, MARKDOWN MANAGEMENT AND SPACE MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED AN

ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA WAREHOUSE TO CAPTURE, MANAGE AND REPORT INFORMATION

RELATING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ASSOCIATES. WE BELIEVE THESE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS

WILL PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENT CUSTOMER CHECK-OUT AND RETURNS, STORE-BASED

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, RAPID ORDER REPLENISHMENT, LABOR PLANNING SUPPORT AND

IMPROVED ANALYTICAL TOOLS.

WHILE OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OUR STORES, WE ARE

ALSO MAKING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS IN LOGISTICS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE

FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPANY. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE CONTINUED MULTI-YEAR PROJECTS

TO UPGRADE OUR HUMAN RESOURCES AND ENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE

THESE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP US MANAGE AND CONTROL THE GROWTH AND INCREASING

COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT

REPORTING.

ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE EMPLOYED OVER 280,000

ASSOCIATES, OF WHOM APPROXIMATELY 17,000 WERE SALARIED, WITH THE REMAINDER

COMPENSATED ON AN HOURLY BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 63% OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE

EMPLOYED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE GOOD.

TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE

SALARY AND WAGE LEVELS IN EACH MARKET AREA. STORE MANAGERS HAVE ACCESS TO

INFORMATION REGARDING COMPETITIVE SALARY RATES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

10

WE DEVELOP OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF

OUR ASSOCIATES. THESE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MANDATORY PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TRAINING

CLASSES, ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ASSOCIATES' KNOWLEDGE OF MERCHANDISING

DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS, AND TO EDUCATE, DEVELOP AND TEST THE SKILLS OF THOSE

ASSOCIATES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BEING PROMOTED. BECAUSE WE PROMOTE OR RELOCATE

CURRENT ASSOCIATES TO SERVE AS MANAGERS AND ASSISTANT MANAGERS FOR NEW STORES,

TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATES IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR GROWTH. OUR

DISTRICT MANAGERS AND STORE MANAGERS TYPICALLY MEET WITH OUR HUMAN RESOURCES

MANAGERS TO DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND CERTAIN

DEPARTMENT HEADS AND CONSIDER POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION.

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS IN OUR STORES AND DIVISIONAL OFFICES TO ENSURE WE

HIRE AND PROMOTE THE MOST QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAY. ONE

OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS WE HAVE IS OUR ANNUAL HUMAN RESOURCES REVIEW

PROCESS, WHICH ASSESSES LEADERS AND TEAMS, REVIEWS SUCCESSION PLANNING AND

EXECUTIVE PIPELINE, HIGH POTENTIAL ASSOCIATES, STAFFING, RETENTION, DIVERSITY,

TRAINING AND COMPLIANCE. THE PROGRAM IS CLOSELY LINKED TO OUR PERFORMANCE

MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WHICH EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE, LEADERSHIP AND POTENTIAL

OF ALL ASSOCIATES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A LIST OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHO ARE

INTERESTED IN NEW ASSIGNMENTS AND OF QUALIFIED OUTSIDE APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE

REVIEWED WHEN POSITIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.

MARKETING. WE ARE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAIL ADVERTISERS, AND WE UTILIZE

ALL FORMS OF MASS MEDIA AND SELECTED FORMS OF HIGHLY TARGETED MEDIA. WE ALSO

INCORPORATE MAJOR SPONSORSHIPS INTO OUR MARKETING PLAN, SUCH AS NASCAR(R), THE

OLYMPIC(R) GAMES, THE HOME DEPOT CENTER, CBS(R) COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND HOME AND

GARDEN SHOWS. WE EXTEND OUR REACH AND EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH PROPRIETARY

PUBLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE 1-2-3(SM) HOME IMPROVEMENT BOOK SERIES AND STYLE

IDEAS(SM) MAGAZINE.

WE EXECUTE OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON BOTH A NATIONAL AND LOCAL BASIS. BECAUSE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR STORES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA, WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAN SMALLER RETAILERS BY USING

NATIONAL ADVERTISING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE TAILOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR

ADVERTISING LOCALLY TO RESPOND TO MARKET DIFFERENCES, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTS

AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

CREDIT SERVICES. HOME DEPOT OFFERS CREDIT PURCHASE PROGRAMS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY

CREDIT PROVIDERS TO BOTH PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS AND D-I-Y AND D-I-F-M

CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2002, 3.3 MILLION OF THESE NEW HOME DEPOT CREDIT ACCOUNTS

WERE OPENED, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOME DEPOT ACCOUNT HOLDERS TO

APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION. PROPRIETARY CREDIT CARD SALES ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 23% OF ALL HOME DEPOT SALES IN FISCAL 2002. WE ALSO OFFER AN

UNSECURED HOME IMPROVEMENT LOAN THAT GIVES OUR CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN OUR STORES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LOAN PROGRAM

NOT ONLY INCREASES LARGE SALES, SUCH AS KITCHEN AND BATH REMODELS, BUT ALSO

GENERATES INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HOMER TLC, INC., WE

HAVE REGISTERED OR APPLIED FOR REGISTRATION FOR A VARIETY OF TRADE NAMES,

SERVICE MARKS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE

HOME DEPOT(R), THE "HOMER"(R) CHARACTER, EXPO DESIGN CENTER(R) STORES, HAMPTON

BAY(R) FANS, LIGHTING AND ACCESSORIES, GLACIER BAY(R) TOILETS, SINKS AND

FAUCETS, PEGASUS(R) FAUCETS AND BATH ACCESSORIES, TRAFFIC MASTER(R) CARPET,

COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC(R) LIGHTING FIXTURES, WORKFORCE(R) TOOLS, TOOL BOXES AND

SHELVING AND PREMIUMCUT(R) LUMBER. WE REGARD OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS

HAVING SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND AS BEING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE MARKETING OF

OUR COMPANY AND OUR STORES. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS THAT COULD BE

EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

11

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR OUR GLOBALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT WE DIRECTLY

IMPORT, WE HAVE A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR VENDOR OR FACTORY AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, WHICH

MEASURE FACTORS INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY, TIMELY SHIPMENTS AND FILL RATE. THE

PERFORMANCE RECORD IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FACTORIES TO ALLOW THEM TO STRIVE

FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM HAS FOUR COMPONENTS.

-        WE AUTHORIZE LABORATORIES TO TEST PRODUCTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS;

-        WE DEVELOP AND DOCUMENT PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS, BASED ON TEST

RESULTS, APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND

FEATURES DETERMINED BY OUR MERCHANTS;

-        WE ASSESS THE CAPABILITY OF FACTORIES TO MANUFACTURE QUALITY

PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED, AS

WELL AS TO ASSESS THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HOME DEPOT POLICIES;

AND

-        WE ROUTINELY ASSESS PRODUCT QUALITY AND FACTORY PERFORMANCE

BY CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS AT THE FACTORY ON SHIPMENTS TO

ASSURE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS.

LOGISTICS. WE USE SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASE

OUR EFFICIENCIES. IMPORT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS PROCESS OUR GLOBALLY-SOURCED

MERCHANDISE. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE HAD EIGHT IMPORT DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, WE

ALSO HAD 30 LUMBER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA TO

SUPPORT THE LUMBER DEMANDS OF OUR STORES. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE OPENED SEVEN

TRANSIT FACILITIES, INCREASING OUR TRANSIT FACILITY NETWORK TO TEN. AT THESE

FACILITIES, WE RECEIVE MERCHANDISE FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IMMEDIATELY CROSS

DOCK IT ONTO TRUCKS FOR DELIVERY TO OUR STORES. WE PLAN TO ADD BETWEEN FOUR AND

SIX TRANSIT FACILITIES IN FISCAL 2003. THE TRANSIT FACILITY NETWORK WILL

PROVIDE SERVICE TO ALL STORES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND TO EASTERN

CANADA BY THE END OF 2003. WE ALSO OPERATE OTHER SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

FOR SPECIFIC MERCHANDISE NEEDS. THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT FACILITIES

ALLOW US TO PROVIDE HIGH SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR STORES AT RELATIVELY LOW COSTS.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE MERCHANDISE SHIPPED TO OUR

STORES WAS PROCESSED THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSIT

FACILITIES. AS OUR NETWORKS EVOLVE, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE PERCENT OF

MERCHANDISE PROCESSED BY OUR FACILITIES. THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WILL BE

SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM OUR VENDORS TO OUR STORES.

IN ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE SUPPLIES AT OUR STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE

DELIVERY SERVICES DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS

OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO BETTER SATISFY THE NEEDS

OF OUR STORES AND OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO LOWER COSTS.

SAFETY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

AND ASSOCIATES. OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT CONSISTS OF A TEAM OF DIRECTORS AND

MANAGERS IN THE FIELD FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AS WELL AS

AN ATLANTA-BASED TEAM OF DEDICATED SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO EVALUATE AND

IMPLEMENT POLICIES AND PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE. OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING OUR COMPANY'S SAFETY PROGRAM, WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH STORE-LEVEL ASSOCIATES, STORE AND DIVISION MANAGEMENT, AND THE

HUMAN RESOURCES AND MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS. THE PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF OUR

SAFETY PROGRAM ARE (1) ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFETY STANDARDS AND PROCESSES FOR ALL

ASPECTS OF STORE OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, (2) EFFECTIVE TRAINING OF

APPROPRIATE ASSOCIATES ON ALL APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND (3) MONITORING

COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED SAFETY STANDARDS.

12

COMPETITION. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED IN PART ON PRICE, STORE

LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE

SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL,

PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO

SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND

NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT

BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO

THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY

DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN

PROFESSIONALS. DUE TO THE VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO

PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS. WE ESTIMATE THAT

OUR SHARE OF THE HOME IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY IS APPROXIMATELY 10% AND WE BELIEVE

THAT WE ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITOR IN OUR MARKETS.

PREFER TO OWN STORES BECAUSE OF GREATER OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY,

GENERALLY LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. WE

BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF EXISTING LEASE TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE CAN

BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE SPACE FOR LEASE OR PURCHASE THAT IS

READILY AVAILABLE.

1,774,000 SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. IN
