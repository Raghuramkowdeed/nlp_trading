part i
item 1.       business
the home depot, inc. ("home depot" or the "company") is the world's largest
home improvement retailer and the second largest retailer in the united states,
based on net sales volume for fiscal 2002. at the end of the fiscal year ended
february 2, 2003 ("fiscal 2002"), we were operating 1,532 stores. most of our
stores are either home depot(r) stores or expo design center(r) stores. a
description of each of these types of stores is as follows:
-        home depot stores: home depot stores sell a wide assortment
of building materials and home improvement and lawn and
garden products and provide a number of services. home depot
stores average approximately 108,000 square feet of enclosed
space, with an additional approximately 22,000 square feet in
the outside garden area. at the end of fiscal 2002, we had
1,471 home depot stores located throughout the united states
(including puerto rico), canada and mexico. in february 2002,
the company sold its four stores in argentina.
-        expo design center stores: expo design center stores sell
products and services primarily for home decorating and
remodeling projects. unlike home depot stores, expo design
center stores do not sell building materials and lumber. expo
design center stores offer interior design products, such as
kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, soft and hard flooring,
appliances, window treatments, lighting fixtures and
installation services. an average expo design center has
approximately 100,000 square feet of enclosed space. at the
end of fiscal 2002, we were operating 52 expo design center
stores in the united states.
in addition to home depot and expo design center stores, we also have two new
store formats focused on the professional customer called home depot supply and
home depot landscape supply. at the end of fiscal 2002, we were operating five
home depot supply stores and three home depot landscape supply stores. we also
have one test store located in texas called the home depot floor store(sm) that
sells only flooring products.
we operate four wholly-owned subsidiaries, georgia lighting, inc., apex supply
company, inc., your "other" warehouse, inc. and hd builder solutions group,
inc. georgia lighting(r), a specialty lighting designer, distributor and
retailer, has five showroom locations in georgia. apex supply
company is a wholesale supplier of plumbing, hvac, appliances and other related
professional products with 23 locations in florida, georgia, south carolina and
tennessee. your "other" warehouse(r) is a plumbing distributor that focuses on
special order fulfillment through its five distribution centers and one call
center located in louisiana and nevada. hd builder solutions group, inc.
provides products and arranges flooring installation services for professional
homebuilders through 16 locations in maryland, virginia, new jersey, ohio,
pennsylvania, kentucky, florida, colorado and arizona. this business was
acquired in october 2002 when the company acquired substantially all of the
assets of floorworks, inc. and arvada hardwood floor company, and all of the
common stock of floors, inc.
in addition to these subsidiaries, we offer products through two direct
marketing subsidiaries. maintenance warehouse(r), a wholly-owned subsidiary, is
a direct marketer of maintenance, repair and operations products serving
primarily the multi-family housing and lodging facilities management market.
the company fills orders through its 21 distribution centers, which are located
in the united states. national blinds & wallpaper(sm), a wholly-owned subsidiary

wallpaper, custom window treatments and rugs.

retail businesses
home depot stores
operating strategy. the operating strategy of home depot is to offer a broad
assortment of high-quality merchandise and services at competitive prices using
highly knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and aggressive advertising. we
believe that our associates' knowledge of products and home improvement
techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our
ability to maintain customer satisfaction. we regularly check our competitors'
prices to ensure that our prices are competitive within each market.
customers. home depot stores serve three primary customer groups:
-        do-it-yourself ("d-i-y") customers: these customers are
typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their
own projects and installations. to complement the in-store
expertise of our associates, home depot stores offer many
d-i-y "how-to" clinics taught by associates and merchandise
vendors.
-        do-it-for-me ("d-i-f-m") customers: these customers are
typically homeowners who purchase materials themselves and
hire third parties to complete the project and/or
installation. we offer these customers installation services
for a variety of products through third party contractors.
-        professional customers: these customers are professional
remodelers, general contractors, repairmen and tradesmen. in
many stores we offer a variety of programs to these
professional customers, including additional delivery and
will-call services, dedicated staff, extensive merchandise
selections and expanded credit programs, all of which we
believe increase sales.
products. a typical home depot store stocks approximately 40,000 to 50,000
products during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary
items. the following table shows the percentage of revenues of each major
product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years:

=====        =====        =====
we buy our store merchandise from vendors located throughout the world. we are
not dependent on any single vendor. most of our merchandise is purchased
directly from manufacturers, which eliminates "middleman" costs. we believe
that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all
of the products we sell in home depot stores.
we maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality
products directly from overseas manufacturers, which gives our customers a
broader selection of products and better values while enhancing our gross
margin. our product development merchants travel internationally to identify
opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores. additionally, we have
opened two sourcing offices located in shanghai and shenzhen, china, and have a
product development merchant located in bonn, germany. these initiatives enable
us to improve product quality, to import products not currently available to
our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would otherwise be
available if purchased from third-party importers. we currently source products
from more than 500 factories in approximately 40 countries.
to complement and enhance our current product selection, we have formed
strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to
market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. at the end of
fiscal year 2002, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands,
including, but not limited to, john deere(r) lawn and garden tractors;
thomasville(r) kitchen and bathroom cabinets; silestone(r) countertops;
ridgid(r) power tools; behr premium plus(r) paint; mill's pride(r) cabinets;
husky(r) hand tools; ge smartwater(tm) water heaters; philips(r) light bulbs;
toro(r) lawn mowers; vigoro(r) lawn care products gaf(r) roofing products,
honda(r) lawn mowers and lithonia lighting(tm) fluorescent lighting products.
in the future, we may consider additional strategic alignments with other
suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of
products available under brand names that are exclusive to the home depot.
at-home services. home depot stores offer a variety of installed sales and home
maintenance programs through its at-home services(r) business. this service
targets the do-it-for-me customer who will select and purchase materials for a
project and prefers the company to arrange professional installation. we
implement our installed sales programs through independent qualified
contractors and strategic partners in the u.s., canada and mexico. these
programs include the installation of products that are sold in our stores, such
as carpeting, hard flooring, cabinets and solid surface countertops, as well as
the installation by strategic partners of products such as roofing, generators
and furnace and central air systems.
store-related programs. we continually assess our business to find
opportunities to increase customer loyalty, thereby increasing sales.
accordingly, we implemented or expanded a number of in-store initiatives in
home depot stores and programs aimed at supporting store operations during
fiscal 2002, including:
-        professional business customer initiative. we are committed
to being the supplier of choice to a variety of professional
customers, including remodelers, carpenters, plumbers,
painters, electricians, building maintenance professionals
and designers. during fiscal 2002, we continued to expand our
"pro" initiative, which adds service-related programs to our
stores that are designed to increase sales to professional
customers. stores participating in the program have added
associates at a sales desk dedicated to providing more
personalized service to professional customers, including
managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pick-up
or delivery. additionally, during the hours when
professionals typically shop, these stores have assigned
sales associates in certain departments to assist these
customers. to better serve our professional customers, we
have also increased quantities of existing products typically
purchased by professionals in bulk quantities, and we offer
certain items in each department packaged in bulk to offer
additional savings. while aimed at the professional customer,
this program also enables us to better serve our d-i-y
customer with improved customer service, including delivery
and will-call services, expanded credit programs and
additional merchandise. through this initiative, we have
identified best practices in serving our professional
customers that are being implemented in many of our stores
without material additional costs. by the end of fiscal 2002,
we had expanded the pro initiative into 1,135 stores, 600 of
which were added during the year. we anticipate that during
fiscal 2003, we will expand this initiative to more than 204
additional stores.
-        spi program. during fiscal 2002, we implemented the service
performance improvement or "spi" program in all of our new
stores. through the program, certain associates are assigned
specific tasks, allowing others to focus on assisting
customers. additionally, we schedule associates to receive
shipments and stock merchandise when our stores are closed or
during hours when they have fewer customers.
-        appliance sales. during fiscal 2002, we continued the
roll-out of our appliance sales program to our stores in the
u.s. through this program we sell appliances manufactured by
general electric(r), maytag(r) and other manufacturers
through 1,500 to 2,000 feet of dedicated appliance selling
space in selected stores. we display and stock the more
popular appliances in our stores and offer the ability to
special order over 2,300 additional products through computer
kiosks located in the stores. through the computer kiosks we
can check inventory and arrange for delivery to the customer
directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the
order is placed. 743 of our stores had appliance showrooms at
the end of fiscal 2002, and we anticipate adding the
appliance sales program to an additional 671 stores by the
end of fiscal 2003.
-        designplace initiative. we continued to implement our
designplace initiative during fiscal 2002, rolling the
initiative out to an additional 668 stores. the initiative
offers an enhanced shopping experience to our design and
decor customers by providing personalized service from
specially trained associates and enhanced merchandise
selection in an attractive setting. we expect to add the
designplace initiative to an additional 556 stores during
fiscal 2003.
-        tool rental. as part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range
of the needs of our professional and d-i-y customers, we
offer a tool rental service in certain stores. under this
program, we rent approximately 200 commercial-quality tools
in ten categories, including saws, floor sanders, generators,
gas powered lawn equipment and plumbing tools. customers can
rent the tools on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.
our associates who work in the tool rental area receive
special training in the use and maintenance of the tools. at
the end of fiscal 2002, we offered tool rental service in 601
stores compared to 466 stores at the end of fiscal 2001. by
the end of fiscal 2003, we anticipate having tool rental
services in approximately 800 stores. we believe that
offering this service increases the sales of related
merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment similar
to that available for rental.
-        customer contact center. during fiscal 2001, we began testing
the use of a customer contact center to assist with
expediting special orders and managing installation projects.
the customer contact center also supports the sale and
installation of water heaters and hvac equipment nationwide.
calls come into the center where customer service
representatives assist customers with product selection and
scheduling installations. the orders are then fulfilled
through our stores. we believe that the customer contact
center will allow us to provide better customer service, both
in our stores and on the phone, while reducing costs. we
anticipate continuing this test during fiscal 2003.
-        customer education programs. we offer several programs to
enhance the skills and confidence of our d-i-y customers. our
associates and vendors teach "how-to" clinics that focus on
d-i-y projects, such as installing garbage disposals, laying
patio pavers or building a deck. in addition to the clinics,
we offer home depot university(sm), which presents four-week
modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets
of a home improvement topic. for example, a room enhancement
module may provide instruction on paint, wallpaper and window
treatments. through the home depot's kids workshop(sm)
program, children are instructed in tool safety and complete a
small building project, such as a birdhouse or tool box. we
believe that these types of educational programs increase our
sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects,
differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our
position as experts in home improvement.
store growth
united states. at the end of fiscal 2002, we were operating 1,370 home depot
stores in the united states, including puerto rico. during fiscal 2002, we
opened 167 new home depot stores in the u.s. although these new store openings
occurred primarily in existing markets, we continued our geographic expansion
by opening stores in a number of new markets.
to increase customer service levels, gain incremental sales and enhance
long-term market penetration, we often open new stores near the edge of market
areas served by existing stores. while these openings may initially have a
negative impact on comparable store-for-store sales, we believe this
"cannibalization" strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market
share by reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing
customers and attracting new customers to more
convenient locations. at the end of fiscal 2002, we believe that approximately
21% of our stores were cannibalized by certain new stores.
canada. at the end of fiscal 2002, we were operating 89 home depot stores in
seven canadian provinces. of these stores, 11 were opened during fiscal 2002.
mexico. in june 2002, we purchased the assets of madereria del norte, a
four-store chain of home improvement stores in juarez, mexico. at the end of
fiscal 2002, we were operating 12 stores in mexico.
home depot urban stores
we opened our first two urban stores in fiscal 2002. the first opened in
brooklyn with approximately 61,000 square feet and the second opened in staten
island with approximately 79,000 square feet. these stores will carry
approximately 20,000 items, which are selected specifically for the
neighborhood in which the store is located. we plan to open two other urban
stores in fiscal 2003. we are continuing to analyze other urban and
high-density suburban markets throughout the country for additional sites to
test this smaller store concept.
expo design center stores
operating strategy. the operating strategy behind our expo design center stores
is to be a complete home decorating and remodeling resource. each of these
stores offers 10 specialty businesses under one roof and features design
showrooms with full-size displays to help customers visualize the end result of
possible interior design projects. to assist our customers, we also offer
complete project management and installation services. accordingly, we employ
associates who have expertise in designing, planning and completing decorating
and remodeling projects.
customers. typically, customers at expo design center stores are middle to
upper income d-i-f-m customers, who purchase merchandise for installation by
others. accordingly, we offer installation services for most of the products we
sell at these stores. additionally, our trade customers are generally custom
builders, remodelers, designers and architects.
products. expo design center stores offer interior design products and
installation services for kitchens, baths and appliances, as well as products
for lighting, decorating and storage and organization projects.
expo design center stores offer a broad range of merchandise in an effort to
meet the needs of shoppers whose interior design preferences may go beyond the
items available in a home depot store. while there is minimal overlap between
the products offered in home depot stores and expo design center stores, those
products available at expo design center stores represent a broader and more
unique assortment of merchandise. in addition to nationally advertised brand
name products, we also offer items that must be special ordered or that are
typically offered through showrooms open only to design professionals.
in-store services. we have associates at our expo design center stores to
assist with every phase of a project. certified kitchen and bath designers are
on staff, as well as design professionals to help our customers design
lighting, tile and flooring, custom upholstery and bedding, custom closets and
window treatments. installation services are available for most products at
expo design center stores, including kitchens, baths, flooring, wallpaper,
tile, lighting fixtures and window treatments. our project managers ensure that
the products are available and then schedule licensed third party
contractors to complete the work. we also offer special trade services, such as
dedicated outside sales people and designers who are dedicated to helping
professional customers.
store growth. at the end of fiscal 2002, we were operating 52 expo design
center stores, 11 of which were opened during 2002. we currently anticipate
opening two additional expo design center stores in 2003. these new stores are
expected to average approximately 90,000 square feet and will incorporate a
showroom environment.
we currently plan to open total of 206 stores during fiscal 2003, including
home depot stores, expo design center stores and other formats.
other businesses
apex supply company

and other related products. the company employs approximately 570 associates
through 23 locations in florida, georgia, south carolina and tennessee. apex

georgia lighting
georgia lighting is a specialty lighting designer, distributor and retailer
based in atlanta, georgia. the company, which has five showroom locations,
offers an extensive collection of decorative lighting fixtures, supplies,
accents and accessories to commercial and retail customers. we believe that the
acquisition of georgia lighting has allowed us to strengthen our sourcing,
training and merchandising in lighting for both the home depot and expo design
center stores. in fiscal 2003, georgia lighting will transfer its retail
operations to expo design center and its distribution operations to your
"other" warehouse.
hd builder solutions group
in october 2002, we became the largest residential floor covering company
servicing the new home construction industry through our acquisition of floors,
inc., arvada hardwood floor company and floorworks, inc. as a result of these
acquisitions, hd builder solutions group has relationships with each of the top
10 homebuilders in the united states, as well as other regional and local
homebuilders. through these operations we manage the complete new-home flooring
process, from helping the homebuilder's customer make flooring design choices
to scheduling and overseeing the installation of flooring for entire housing
developments. we currently conduct operations from 16 facilities and employ
approximately 1,100 associates.
home depot landscape supply
during fiscal 2002, we opened three home depot landscape supply stores in the
atlanta, georgia market. home depot landscape supply locations are designed to
extend the reach of home depot's garden departments, focusing on the
professional landscapers and avid do-it-yourself garden enthusiasts. each
location has a heated/cooled space of about 12,000 square feet, complete with a
tool rental department, in front of a covered greenhouse. each site also
features a 1 to 3 acre fenced-in "pro-yard." during fiscal 2003, we plan to
open six additional stores in georgia and texas.
home depot supply
home depot supply stores offer personal service to contractors and other
professional customers by providing experienced account managers, expanded
assortments, greater quantities of merchandise and expanded delivery services.
at the end of fiscal 2002, we were operating 5 of these stores in california,
arizona, texas and colorado.

repair and operating supplies to the multi-family housing and lodging
industries. through its catalogs and direct mail programs, maintenance

and personalized service. orders are typically placed over the telephone,
through a field sales representative or through the company's website at
www.mwh.com. orders are filled through one of maintenance warehouse's 21
distribution centers and are shipped for same-day or next-day delivery to
customers across the united states.
national blinds & wallpaper
national blinds and wallpaper sells decor products through telephone sales
under the name designplace direct(sm). designplace direct markets primarily
through home depot advertising and direct mail pieces. designplace direct
maintains no inventory, as orders are shipped directly from the supplier to the
customer.
the home depot floor store
during fiscal 2000, we opened a test store in plano, texas that offers only
flooring products. the home depot floor store's merchandise assortment includes
carpet, ceramic, wood, laminate and vinyl flooring. we continue to analyze the
results of this test.
your "other" warehouse
acquired in november 2001, your "other" warehouse is a distributor of special
order faucet and plumbing fixture products, serving both home depot and other
third party resellers. your "other" warehouse carries over 36,000 products from
over 100 plumbing vendors, including kohler(r), american standard(r) and other
major manufacturers. your "other" warehouse operates five distribution
facilities and a call center.
internet
our primary website is located at www.homedepot.com. the site offers an
assortment of products available for sale on-line, information about projects
and our products, calculators to estimate the amount and kinds of materials
needed to complete a project, as well as information about our company and
links to our other on-line businesses. as with our stores, the focus of our
website is customer service. we believe our internet site provides us with an
opportunity to build relationships with our customers, educate our customers,
improve service, provide convenient shopping from home and increase store
sales. customers may also order select products from www.expo.com, the website
of our expo design center stores, and obtain information about these stores and
the products and services they offer.
through www.homedepot.com, we offer an assortment of approximately 18,000 items
for sale. these items are chosen based on their potential for online sales and
their ability to be delivered via united parcel service(r) and fedex(r).
managing product selection and pricing nationally allows us to promote the same
product and price to all www.homedepot.com visitors and allows us to leverage
certain online marketing channels that reach across many or all home depot
store pricing markets.
during fiscal 2002, we enhanced the content of the website associated with our
at-home services division to describe each of the services offered and added
the capability to allow potential customers to conveniently sign up online for
in-home consultations. we anticipate continuing to improve the quality and
quantity of services-related content on the site.
in fiscal 2002, the website www.homedepot.ca was launched to service our
canadian customers. the site is informational only and provides information on
the home depot, a store locator, as well as a link to www.homedepot.com. the
website is bilingual (english and french) to service our customers in canada's
two official languages.
store support services
information technologies. during fiscal 2002, the company increased its focus
on the information technology needs of our growing business and family of
companies. currently we provide business information through extensive
fault-tolerant, high-speed networks and through an array of approximately
135,000 personal computers, 7,000 servers and 125,000 other network-connected
devices. these systems provide store, corporate, financial, merchandising and
other back office function support.
during fiscal 2002, the company began the installation of self-checkout
systems, as well as a total replacement and upgrade of our pos systems. in
addition, store managers received new tools for labor planning, staffing,
scheduling and workload management to better allocate associates to support
customer service and improve execution of in-store initiatives. the company
also deployed automated tools to assist our merchants with assortment planning,
pricing, markdown management and space management. we have also implemented an
enterprise-wide data warehouse to capture, manage and report information
relating to our customers and associates. we believe these system enhancements
will provide more efficient customer check-out and returns, store-based
inventory management, rapid order replenishment, labor planning support and
improved analytical tools.
while our technology investments are primarily focused on our stores, we are
also making technology improvements in logistics and the administrative
functions of the company. during fiscal 2002, we continued multi-year projects
to upgrade our human resources and enterprise financial systems. we believe
these investments will help us manage and control the growth and increasing
complexity of our business, as well as provide more comprehensive management
reporting.
associate development. at the end of fiscal 2002, we employed over 280,000
associates, of whom approximately 17,000 were salaried, with the remainder
compensated on an hourly basis. approximately 63% of our associates are
employed on a full-time basis. we believe that our employee relations are good.
to attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive
salary and wage levels in each market area. store managers have access to
information regarding competitive salary rates in their respective markets.
we develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of
our associates. these programs, including mandatory product knowledge training
classes, are designed to increase associates' knowledge of merchandising
departments and products, and to educate, develop and test the skills of those
associates who are interested in being promoted. because we promote or relocate
current associates to serve as managers and assistant managers for new stores,
training and assessment of our associates is essential to our growth. our
district managers and store managers typically meet with our human resources
managers to discuss the development of assistant managers and certain
department heads and consider possible candidates for promotion.
we have implemented programs in our stores and divisional offices to ensure we
hire and promote the most qualified associates in a non-discriminatory way. one
of the most significant programs we have is our annual human resources review
process, which assesses leaders and teams, reviews succession planning and
executive pipeline, high potential associates, staffing, retention, diversity,
training and compliance. the program is closely linked to our performance
management process, which evaluates the performance, leadership and potential
of all associates. we also maintain a list of qualified associates who are
interested in new assignments and of qualified outside applicants that can be
reviewed when positions become available.
marketing. we are one of the nation's largest retail advertisers, and we utilize
all forms of mass media and selected forms of highly targeted media. we also
incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan, such as nascar(r), the
olympic(r) games, the home depot center, cbs(r) college football and home and
garden shows. we extend our reach and educate our customers through proprietary
publications, such as the 1-2-3(sm) home improvement book series and style
ideas(sm) magazine.
we execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis. because
the vast majority of our stores are located throughout the united states and
canada, we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers by using
national advertising. at the same time, we tailor the majority of our
advertising locally to respond to market differences, both in terms of products
and the competitive environment.
credit services. home depot offers credit purchase programs through third-party
credit providers to both professional customers and d-i-y and d-i-f-m
customers. in fiscal 2002, 3.3 million of these new home depot credit accounts
were opened, bringing the total number of home depot account holders to
approximately 12 million. proprietary credit card sales accounted for
approximately 23% of all home depot sales in fiscal 2002. we also offer an
unsecured home improvement loan that gives our customers the opportunity to
purchase products and services in our stores. we believe that this loan program
not only increases large sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also
generates incremental sales from our customers.
intellectual property. through our wholly-owned subsidiary, homer tlc, inc., we
have registered or applied for registration for a variety of trade names,
service marks, trademarks and copyrights for use in our business, including the
home depot(r), the "homer"(r) character, expo design center(r) stores, hampton
bay(r) fans, lighting and accessories, glacier bay(r) toilets, sinks and
faucets, pegasus(r) faucets and bath accessories, traffic master(r) carpet,
commercial electric(r) lighting fixtures, workforce(r) tools, tool boxes and
shelving and premiumcut(r) lumber. we regard our intellectual property as
having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of
our company and our stores. we are not aware of any facts that could be
expected to negatively impact our intellectual property.
quality assurance program. for our globally sourced products that we directly
import, we have a quality assurance program. through this program, we have
established criteria for vendor or factory and product performance, which
measure factors including product quality, timely shipments and fill rate. the
performance record is made available to the factories to allow them to strive
for improvement. the quality assurance program has four components:
-        we authorize laboratories to test products prior to purchase
to ensure compliance with requirements;
-        we develop and document product requirements, based on test
results, applicable national and international standards and
features determined by our merchants;
-        we assess the capability of factories to manufacture quality
products that meet the expectations we have developed, as
well as to assess their compliance with home depot policies;
and
-        we routinely assess product quality and factory performance
by conducting inspections at the factory on shipments to
assure continued compliance with our product requirements.
logistics. we use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase
our efficiencies. import distribution centers process our globally-sourced
merchandise. at the end of fiscal 2002, we had eight import distribution
centers located in the united states and canada. at the end of fiscal 2002, we
also had 30 lumber distribution centers in the united states and canada to
support the lumber demands of our stores. during fiscal 2002, we opened seven
transit facilities, increasing our transit facility network to ten. at these
facilities, we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately cross
dock it onto trucks for delivery to our stores. we plan to add between four and
six transit facilities in fiscal 2003. the transit facility network will
provide service to all stores in the continental united states and to eastern
canada by the end of 2003. we also operate other specialty distribution centers
for specific merchandise needs. the distribution centers and transit facilities
allow us to provide high service levels to our stores at relatively low costs.
at the end of fiscal 2002, approximately 30% of the merchandise shipped to our
stores was processed through our network of distribution centers and transit
facilities. as our networks evolve, we expect to increase the percent of
merchandise processed by our facilities. the remaining merchandise will be
shipped directly from our vendors to our stores.
in addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores, we also provide
delivery services directly to our customers. we continually assess
opportunities to improve our distribution network to better satisfy the needs
of our stores and our customers and to lower costs.
safety. we are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers
and associates. our safety department consists of a team of directors and
managers in the field focused primarily on education and training, as well as
an atlanta-based team of dedicated safety professionals who evaluate and
implement policies and processes company-wide. our safety department is
responsible for managing our company's safety program, which is implemented in
conjunction with store-level associates, store and division management, and the
human resources and merchandising departments. the primary elements of our
safety program are (1) establishment of safety standards and processes for all
aspects of store operations and merchandising, (2) effective training of
appropriate associates on all applicable standards and (3) monitoring
compliance with established safety standards.
competition. our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store
location, customer service and depth of merchandise. in each of the markets we
serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical,
plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. with respect to
some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and
national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent
building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. in addition to
these entities, our expo design center stores also compete with specialty
design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design
professionals. due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to
precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. we estimate that
our share of the home improvement industry is approximately 10% and we believe
that we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets.

18% were leased consisting of approximately 29,122,000 square feet. in recent
years, we have increased the relative percentage of new stores that are owned.
although we take advantage of lease financing opportunities, we generally
prefer to own stores because of greater operating control and flexibility,
generally lower occupancy costs and certain other economic advantages. we
believe that at the end of existing lease terms, our current leased space can
be either relet or replaced by alternate space for lease or purchase that is
readily available.
