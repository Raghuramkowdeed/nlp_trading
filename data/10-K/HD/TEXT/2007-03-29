CUSTOMERS.

THE HOME DEPOT STORES SERVE THREE PRIMARY CUSTOMER GROUPS.

AND MERCHANDISE VENDORS.



DO-IT-FOR-ME ("D-I-F-M") CUSTOMERS.

OUR LOGISTICS PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE EXCELLENT PRODUCT AVAILABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS, EFFECTIVE

USE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY AND LOW TOTAL SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, WE OPERATED 18 IMPORT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, WE

EVOLVE, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR FLOW-THROUGH. THE REMAINING MERCHANDISE WILL BE SHIPPED DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR STORES. IN ADDITION TO REPLENISHING MERCHANDISE SUPPLIES AT OUR

STORES, WE ALSO PROVIDE DELIVERY SERVICES DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR

SECOND FISCAL QUARTER AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OTHER

RETAILERS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ENTITIES, OUR EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. DUE TO THE

VARIETY OF COMPETITION WE FACE, WE ARE UNABLE TO PRECISELY MEASURE THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS.

HD SUPPLY SEGMENT

OPERATING STRATEGY.

OUR OPERATING STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE A TOTAL SOLUTION FOR EVERY PHASE OF A BUILDING PROJECT,

FROM INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONSTRUCTION TO LIFETIME MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND REMODEL. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROAD PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING, OUR HIGHLY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALES FORCE AND OUR REPUTATION FOR

SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ENABLE US TO BE A SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT LIFECYCLE.

4

CUSTOMERS.

WE DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS AND OFFER SERVICES PRIMARILY TO BUILDERS, CONTRACTORS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES,

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS. OUR CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY SELECT THEIR VENDORS PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND EXPERTISE OF SALES PERSONNEL,

PRICE AND THE QUALITY AND SCOPE OF SERVICES OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS GENERALLY PURCHASE LARGE VOLUMES, ARE REPEAT BUYERS BECAUSE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN LONGER-TERM

PROJECTS AND REQUIRE SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE COMPLEMENT OUR PRODUCT OFFERING WITH CUSTOMER-DRIVEN, VALUE-ADDED SERVICES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED SUPPLY, DESIGN ASSISTANCE, KITTING, ASSEMBLY AND

FABRICATION SERVICES.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE FOCUSED AROUND THE FOLLOWING FOUR MAJOR CATEGORIES THAT ARE

RELATED TO DIFFERENT PHASES OF A BUILDING PROJECT.



INFRASTRUCTURE.

THIS CATEGORY COVERS THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSTRUCT AND SUPPORT THE PUBLIC WORKS SYSTEMS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROJECTS.



CONSTRUCTION.

THIS CATEGORY COVERS THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR STRUCTURAL BUILDING COMPONENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROJECTS.



MAINTENANCE.

THIS CATEGORY COVERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATIONS NEEDS OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING, HOSPITALITY, HEALTHCARE, GOVERNMENT

AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES.



REPAIR

AND REMODEL: THIS CATEGORY COVERS HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND BUILDING MATERIALS, SERVING THE CONSUMER, PROFESSIONAL HANDYMAN AND LIGHT REMODELER MARKETS.

INVENTORIES.

WE MAINTAIN EXTENSIVE INVENTORIES TO MEET THE RAPID DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR

INVENTORIES ARE BASED ON THE NEEDS, DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND LEAD TIMES OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE FOCUS ON DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS THAT LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, PURCHASING, SPECIALIZED

SALES FORCE, DISTRIBUTION AND LOGISTICS, CREDIT MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

CREDIT SERVICES.

OVER 90% OF OUR SALES VOLUME IS FACILITATED THROUGH THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR

BUSINESSES OFFER CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS, EITHER THROUGH UNSECURED CREDIT THAT IS BASED SOLELY UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER, OR SECURED CREDIT FOR MATERIALS SOLD FOR A SPECIFIC JOB WHERE THE

SECURITY LIES IN LIEN RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MATERIAL GOING INTO THE JOB. THE TYPE OF CREDIT OFFERED DEPENDS BOTH ON THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH

THE CUSTOMER IS INVOLVED. END USERS, RESELLERS AND OTHER NON-CONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS GENERALLY PURCHASE MORE ON UNSECURED CREDIT THAN SECURED CREDIT. THESE LINES OF CREDIT ARE GRANTED ONLY

AFTER A SUFFICIENT REVIEW OF THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, ON A REGULAR BASIS, LARGE UNSECURED CREDIT LINES ARE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THEY ARE STILL FINANCIALLY SOUND.

LOGISTICS.

OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK CONSISTS OF OVER 1,000 COMBINED BRANCHES AND CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN

THE UNITED STATES. THE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IS CRITICAL IN PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE. OUR CENTRAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND BRANCHES USE WAREHOUSE

MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE RECEIVING, INVENTORY CONTROL AND PICKING, PACKING AND SHIPPING FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE LEVERAGE SEVERAL OF OUR LARGER BRANCHES AS DISTRIBUTION POINTS FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCT LINES.

THE

MAJORITY OF CUSTOMER ORDERS ARE SHIPPED FROM INVENTORY AT OUR BRANCHES. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE DELIVERY PROCESS, WE USE OVER 4,000 VEHICLES FROM OUR TOTAL VEHICLE FLEET TO

DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO ACCOMMODATE SPECIAL ORDERS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AND FACILITATE THE SHIPMENT OF CERTAIN LARGE VOLUME ORDERS DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE CUSTOMER.

ORDERS FOR LARGER CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS NORMALLY REQUIRE LONG-TERM DELIVERY SCHEDULES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF CONSTRUCTION, WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

5

SEASONALITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR

SECOND FISCAL QUARTER AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION.

WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS OF OUR RANGE OF PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WE

BELIEVE THAT NO OTHER COMPANY COMPETES AGAINST US ACROSS ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES. HOWEVER, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINES. OUR COMPETITION INCLUDES OTHER

WHOLESALERS, MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CUSTOMER BASE AND SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS THAT RESELL OUR PRODUCTS. TO A LIMITED EXTENT, RETAILERS OF PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL

FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES, BUILDING MATERIALS, MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND OPERATIONS SUPPLIES AND CONTRACTORS' TOOLS ALSO COMPETE WITH US. COMPETITION VARIES DEPENDING ON PRODUCT LINE, CUSTOMER CLASSIFICATION

AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES; TECHNICAL PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE AS TO

APPLICATION AND USAGE; ADVISORY OR OTHER SERVICE CAPABILITIES; ABILITY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS; SAME-DAY DELIVERY CAPABILITIES IN CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES; PRICING OF

PRODUCTS AND PROVISION OF CREDIT.

SUPPORT SERVICES

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

DURING FISCAL 2006, WE CONTINUED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS

TO SUPPORT BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PROVIDE AN IMPROVED SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT IN OUR STORES. WE COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF SELF-CHECKOUT REGISTERS TO ALL OUR U.S. STORES AND THE

MAJORITY OF OUR STORES IN CANADA AND ENHANCED OUR COUPON PROCESSING AT ALL CHECK-OUTS. WE ALSO BEGAN IMPLEMENTING IN-STORE CALL BOXES AND INSTALLED VOICE OVER INTERNET PHONE

SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS FASTER ASSISTANCE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR APPLIANCE BUSINESS, WE UPGRADED OUR PROPRIETARY DEPOT DIRECT APPLIANCE FULFILLMENT

SYSTEM.

IN

ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN STORE TECHNOLOGY, WE UPGRADED OUR ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WHICH IMPROVES THE SPEED AND ACCURACY OF ONLINE ORDER PROCESSING AND PROVIDES CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY

TO CHECK SPECIAL ORDER STATUS ON THE INTERNET. WE ALSO DEFINED A SET OF COMMON ENTERPRISE SYSTEM PLATFORMS FOR OUR HD SUPPLY WHOLESALE BUSINESSES AND BEGAN MIGRATING THE HD SUPPLY BUSINESSES TO THESE

PLATFORMS, BEGINNING WITH THE PAYROLL AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS.

WE

ALSO BEGAN WORK ON THE STRATEGIC EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT A NEW RETAIL SYSTEMS PLATFORM TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MERCHANDISING FUNCTIONS AND STORE OPERATIONS. WE ALSO COMMENCED THE

EFFORT TO ADD NEW AUTOMATION INTO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN FUNCTIONS FOCUSING ON NEW SYSTEMS FOR WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION, TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCEMENTS TO SUPPORT GREATER ORDER PENETRATION THROUGH

OUR CENTRALIZED REPLENISHMENT SYSTEMS.

ASSOCIATES.

ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT, GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL, THAT COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS. FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO UPDATE THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. YOU ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO REVIEW ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED

SUBJECTS IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS WITH THE SEC.

RISING COSTS, A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF DOING

BUSINESS, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR AVERAGE TICKET PRICE.

INTEREST RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, EMPLOYMENT, STATE OF THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING MARKETS,

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND GENERAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORISM AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT ADVERSELY

7

AFFECT

CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS COULD.



INCREASE

OUR COSTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY UNDERTAKING OR DETERMINE NOT TO UNDERTAKE NEW HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY OR DETERMINE NOT TO UNDERTAKE NEW SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL, RESIDENTIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS, AND



LEAD

TO A DECLINE IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND IN AVERAGE TICKET PRICE.

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS, AND IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OUR ABILITY TO

TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN

SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES ALSO CAN BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS' NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT

CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF

WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIATION.

ANY INABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ON SCHEDULE WILL DELAY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE NEW STORES TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN EXISTING MARKETS AND ENTER NEW MARKETS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO.



IDENTIFY

ATTRACTIVE LOCATIONS,



NEGOTIATE

LEASES OR REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS,



ATTRACT

AND TRAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND



MANAGE

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

OUR

ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ALSO WILL BE AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LOCAL ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LAND USE. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS

WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN STORES ON SCHEDULE, WHICH WILL DELAY THE IMPACT OF THESE NEW STORES ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

8

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS BOTH IN OUR STORES AND BRANCHES AND IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES ARE

DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS A BETTER EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL

PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR NEW OR UPGRADED

TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR THE TECHNOLOGY MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND

TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO DESIGN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES, SPENDING

PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT OUR

SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

OUR STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN EXISTING AND NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND THE OPENING OF NEW STORES AND

BRANCHES. OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN EXPANDING OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES.

TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE CONTROLLING RELATED LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL

LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE IN HOURLY POSITIONS WITH HISTORICALLY

HIGH TURNOVER RATES. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL AND NON-RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR THESE ASSOCIATES AND INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND

9

MOTIVATING

THEM. WE ALSO DEPEND ON OUR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY ASSOCIATES FOR OUR SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE

RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, INVENTORIES, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE

ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY OUR MANAGEMENT. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS BY OUR MANAGEMENT COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INCREASED COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR RETAIL BUSINESS COMPETES PRINCIPALLY BASED ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH OF

MERCHANDISE. OUR HD SUPPLY BUSINESS COMPETES PRINCIPALLY BASED ON ABILITY TO PROVIDE AND DELIVER SUPPLIES, PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, ADVISORY SERVICES AND AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. IN EACH MARKET

WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT

STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR

SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALERS AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASES. INTENSE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE PRESSURES, OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY,

SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE

OUTCOMES OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, WITH CERTAINTY. THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX REGULATIONS

COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ADDITIONALLY, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, WE HAD 47 OTHER RETAIL STORE LOCATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED 34 EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES LOCATED IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA,

FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ILLINOIS, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, MISSOURI, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, TENNESSEE, TEXAS AND VIRGINIA; 11 THE HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES LOCATED IN GEORGIA AND TEXAS; AND TWO THE

HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORES LOCATED IN FLORIDA AND TEXAS. WE ALSO OPERATED SEVEN HOME DECORATORS COLLECTION LOCATIONS IN ILLINOIS, KANSAS, MISSOURI AND OKLAHOMA.

OF

OUR 2,147 RETAIL STORES AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, APPROXIMATELY 87% WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 196.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET, AND

APPROXIMATELY 13% OF SUCH STORES WERE LEASED CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 29.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF NEW STORES THAT ARE

OWNED. WE GENERALLY PREFER TO OWN RETAIL STORES BECAUSE OF GREATER OPERATING CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY, GENERALLY LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES.

AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2006, OUR RETAIL SEGMENT UTILIZED 195 WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN 42 STATES, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 28.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY

2.0 MILLION IS OWNED AND APPROXIMATELY 26.2 MILLION IS LEASED.

HD

SUPPLY CONSISTS OF FOUR MAJOR PLATFORMS: INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND REMODEL. THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM CONSISTS OF 325 U.S. BRANCHES IN 41 STATES AND FOUR BRANCHES

IN CANADA. THE CONSTRUCTION PLATFORM CONSISTS OF 527 U.S. BRANCHES IN 35 STATES AND 56 BRANCHES IN CANADA. THE MAINTENANCE PLATFORM CONSISTS OF 90 U.S. BRANCHES IN 25 STATES AND FIVE BRANCHES IN

CANADA. FINALLY, THE REPAIR AND REMODEL PLATFORM CONSISTS OF 13 U.S. BRANCHES IN TWO STATES. ONE OR MORE PLATFORMS MAY OPERATE MULTIPLE BRANCHES AT ONE HD SUPPLY LOCATION.

12

OF OUR 893 HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, APPROXIMATELY 13% WERE OWNED (INCLUDING THOSE OWNED SUBJECT TO A GROUND LEASE) AND APPROXIMATELY 87% OF SUCH STORES WERE LEASED. WE GENERALLY

PREFER TO LEASE HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS AS IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND WITH OUR HD SUPPLY CUSTOMER BASE. ADDITIONALLY, HD SUPPLY HAD 66 U.S. WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED

IN 19 STATES AND TWO IN CANADA TO SUPPORT OTHER HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS. THE HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS, WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY 23.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY 2.8 MILLION IS OWNED AND APPROXIMATELY 20.9 MILLION IS LEASED AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006.

OUR

EXECUTIVE, CORPORATE STAFF, DIVISIONAL STAFF AND FINANCIAL OFFICES OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF LEASED AND OWNED SPACE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, WE

OCCUPIED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET IS OWNED AND APPROXIMATELY 1.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET IS LEASED, FOR

STORE SUPPORT CENTERS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTERS.

WE

BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF EXISTING LEASE TERMS, OUR CURRENT LEASED SPACE CAN BE EITHER RELET OR REPLACED BY ALTERNATE SPACE FOR LEASE OR PURCHASE THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INFORMAL REQUEST FROM THE STAFF OF THE SEC FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO THIS AND SUBSEQUENT REQUESTS AND CONTINUES TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC STAFF. THE SEC HAS INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE INFORMAL INQUIRY IS

NOT AN INDICATION THAT ANY VIOLATIONS OF LAW HAVE OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS INFORMAL INQUIRY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JUNE 2006, THE SEC COMMENCED AN INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES, AND THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HAS ALSO

REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT. IN ADDITION, A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEWED THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND ENGAGED INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO ASSIST IN

THIS MATTER. ON DECEMBER 6, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE UNRECORDED EXPENSE FROM 1981 THROUGH THE PRESENT IS APPROXIMATELY

$227 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING RELATED TAX ITEMS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, "CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS

WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS

IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS," THE COMPANY CORRECTED THESE ERRORS BY DECREASING BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 BY $227 MILLION, WITH OFFSETTING ENTRIES TO

PAID-IN CAPITAL, OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, WITHIN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE ARE CONTINUING TO COOPERATE WITH THE SEC

AND THE OFFICE OF U.S. ATTORNEY. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND, IN SOME CASES, AGAINST CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT

THEIR OUTCOME, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ACTIONS, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AND RULE 10B-5 THEREUNDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE FILED BY CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE COMPANY. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS

13

DISMISSED

HIS COMPLAINT. THE COURT HAS PRELIMINARILY APPOINTED A LEAD PLAINTIFF, AND THE LEAD PLAINTIFF HAS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN EACH OF THE REMAINING FIVE ACTIONS. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE

AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY.

IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, THREE PURPORTED, BUT AS YET UNCERTIFIED, CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE HOME DEPOT FUTUREBUILDER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE AND

OF 1974 IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S RETURN-TO-VENDOR AND STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

GEORGIA IN ATLANTA. THESE ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, COSTS, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EQUITABLE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THESE ACTIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY.

IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2006, SIX SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS WERE FILED NOMINALLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AGAINST CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ABUSE OF CONTROL, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S

RETURN-TO-VENDOR, STOCK OPTION, AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. SUCH ACTIONS

WERE FILED BY ALLEGED SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. RELIEF SOUGHT IN EACH ACTION INCLUDES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION OBTAINED BY THE

DEFENDANTS, COSTS, AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. SUBSEQUENTLY, ONE JOINT AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON BEHALF OF ALL PLAINTIFFS ENCOMPASSING ALL THE VARIOUS CLAIMS AND SEEKING THE SAME RELIEF. THE DEFENDANTS

HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS OR ALTERNATIVELY STAY THE LITIGATION.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, ONE ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED NOMINALLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AGAINST CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT DIRECTORS AND ITS FORMER CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA IN ATLANTA, ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, ABUSE OF CONTROL, GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS AND

UNJUST ENRICHMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THE ACTION WAS FILED BY ALLEGED SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE ACTION INCLUDES

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.

IN

COMPLIANCE WITH SEC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS SET FORTH BELOW INVOLVE POTENTIAL MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $100,000 OR MORE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME

OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, IT DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SUCH OUTCOME TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

ALLEGED POLLUTANT DISCHARGES DURING CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AT CERTAIN THE HOME DEPOT STORES. THE EPA SUBSEQUENTLY REFERRED THIS MATTER TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ("DOJ"). THE DOJ AND THE

COMPANY ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER.

IN

APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK'S OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY RELATED TO THE SALE AND HANDLING OF PESTICIDES. THE COMPANY

IN

14

INVESTIGATING

THIS MATTER. IN JANUARY 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA SEEKING RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS IN

CONNECTION WITH SUCH INVESTIGATION. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE RESPECTIVE AUTHORITIES. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE COMPANY ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL

SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA

FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2007 ("FISCAL 2006"), WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF $5.8 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.79 COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS

OF $5.8 BILLION AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.72 FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 29, 2006 ("FISCAL 2005"). NET SALES INCREASED 11.4% TO $90.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM

$81.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS 32.8% AND OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 10.7% FOR FISCAL 2006.

IN

THE FACE OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE HOUSING MARKET, OUR RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECLINED 2.8% IN FISCAL 2006 DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN COMPARABLE STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY AN INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE TICKET OF 1.6% IN FISCAL 2006 TO $58.90, INCLUDING INCREASES IN 8 OF 10 SELLING DEPARTMENTS.

WE

GREW OUR NUMEROUS INSTALLATION AND HOME MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS SERVING OUR DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR STORES. OUR RETAIL SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 8.3% TO

$3.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006. WE EXPERIENCED SUSTAINED GROWTH IN CATEGORIES SUCH AS COUNTERTOPS, EXTERIOR PATIOS, SOLAR, WINDOWS AND HVAC.

WE

CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE INNOVATIVE AND DISTINCTIVE MERCHANDISE THAT REFLECTS EMERGING CONSUMER TRENDS, SUPPORTED BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY. WE INVESTED

$3.5 BILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2006 PRIMARILY FOR NEW STORE CONSTRUCTION, STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY. WE BEGAN AN ACCELERATED STORE REINVESTMENT PROGRAM WHEREBY WE

INCREASED OUR INVESTMENT IN EXISTING STORES BY $350 MILLION MORE THAN OUR PLAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2006 TO ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THIS INVESTMENT INCLUDED CAPITAL AND EXPENSE

DOLLARS TO RESET 100 MERCHANDISE BAYS IN 540 STORES, INCORPORATE A RICHER STAFFING MODEL AND SUPPORT OUR "ORANGE JUICED" PROGRAM, A CUSTOMER SERVICE INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR OUR STORE ASSOCIATES.

WE

ADDED 125 NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2006, INCLUDING 12 STORES THROUGH OUR ACQUISITION OF THE HOME WAY, A CHINESE HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER, AND 10 RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR TOTAL STORE COUNT AT THE END

OF FISCAL 2006 TO 2,147. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2006, 228, OR APPROXIMATELY 11%, OF OUR STORES WERE LOCATED IN CANADA, MEXICO OR CHINA COMPARED TO 191, OR APPROXIMATELY 9%, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2005.

WE

HAVE EXPANDED OUR BUSINESS BY CAPTURING A GROWING SHARE OF THE PROFESSIONAL RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND HEAVY CONSTRUCTION MARKETS THROUGH THE GROWTH OF HD SUPPLY. HD SUPPLY EXPERIENCED 162% NET

SALES GROWTH IN FISCAL 2006 AND ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 13% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES IN FISCAL 2006. WE COMPLETED 12 ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2006 THAT WERE INTEGRATED INTO HD SUPPLY, INCLUDING HUGHES

SUPPLY, INC., A LEADING DISTRIBUTOR OF CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR PRODUCTS. ORGANIC NET SALES GROWTH FOR THE HD SUPPLY SEGMENT WAS 5.6% IN FISCAL 2006.

IN

FEBRUARY 2007, WE ANNOUNCED OUR DECISION TO EVALUATE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR HD SUPPLY. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF HD SUPPLY, WE WOULD NEED TO FURTHER INTEGRATE IT WITH OUR RETAIL

BUSINESS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING WHETHER THIS INTEGRATION OR OTHER STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS A SALE OR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF THE BUSINESS, WOULD CREATE THE MOST SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

WE

GENERATED $7.7 BILLION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2006. WE USED THIS CASH FLOW, ALONG WITH THE NET PROCEEDS OF ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OF $7.6 BILLION, TO FUND

$8.1 BILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS, $4.3 BILLION IN ACQUISITIONS AND $3.5 BILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, OUR LONG-TERM

DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 47%. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (COMPUTED ON BEGINNING LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS) WAS 20.5% AT THE END

OF FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 22.4% FOR FISCAL 2005.

WE

BELIEVE THE SELECTED SALES DATA, THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NET SALES AND MAJOR CATEGORIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

WE

OPERATE IN TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: RETAIL AND HD SUPPLY. THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN THE OPERATION OF RETAIL STORES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO AND OUR

RECENTLY ACQUIRED STORES IN CHINA. THE HD SUPPLY SEGMENT DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS AND SELLS INSTALLATION SERVICES TO BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING HOME BUILDERS,

PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTORS, MUNICIPALITIES AND MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS. WE IDENTIFY SEGMENTS BASED ON HOW MANAGEMENT MAKES OPERATING DECISIONS, ASSESSES PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES. THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 WAS THE FIRST PERIOD IN WHICH WE BEGAN TO REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN TWO SEGMENTS. THIS CHANGE WAS A RESULT OF THE PURCHASE OF HUGHES SUPPLY, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASED THE SIZE OF HD SUPPLY AND RESULTED IN CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL REPORTING AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.

THE

RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDES THE HOME DEPOT STORES, EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ("EXPO") AND OTHER RETAIL FORMATS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT ALSO INCLUDES OUR RETAIL SERVICES BUSINESS AND OUR CATALOG AND

ON-LINE SALES BUSINESSES.

THE

HD SUPPLY SEGMENT CONSISTS OF FOUR MAJOR PLATFORMS: 1) INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING WATERWORKS AND UTILITIES; 2) CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY, LUMBER AND BUILDING

MATERIALS, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING/HVAC AND INTERIORS; 3) MAINTENANCE, INCLUDING FACILITIES MAINTENANCE AND INDUSTRIAL PVF; AND 4) REPAIR AND REMODEL.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

NET SALES

TOTAL NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2006 INCREASED 11.4%, OR $9.3 BILLION, TO $90.8 BILLION FROM $81.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. OF THE $9.3 BILLION INCREASE,

$7.3 BILLION, NET OF INTERCOMPANY SALES, CAME FROM OUR HD SUPPLY SEGMENT AND $2.0 BILLION CAME FROM OUR RETAIL SEGMENT.

NET

SALES FOR OUR RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $79.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006, A 2.6% INCREASE OVER FISCAL 2005. FISCAL 2006 RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SALES FROM NEW STORES.

RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 2.8% FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF 3.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE DECLINE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES WAS DRIVEN BY A 4.6% DECLINE IN COMPARABLE

STORE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS OFFSET IN PART BY A 1.6% INCREASE IN AVERAGE TICKET. OUR AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED TO $58.90 FOR FISCAL 2006 AND INCREASED IN 8 OF 10 SELLING DEPARTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN

RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. RETAIL HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET AS WELL AS DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS DUE

TO SALES ARISING FROM HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN FISCAL 2005. BOTH CANADA AND MEXICO, HOWEVER, EXPERIENCED POSITIVE RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR FISCAL 2006. ADDITIONALLY, OUR RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE

SALES RESULTS REFLECT IN PART THE IMPACT OF CANNIBALIZATION. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE OBJECTIVES, WE STRATEGICALLY OPEN STORES NEAR MARKET AREAS SERVED BY EXISTING STORES ("CANNIBALIZE")

TO ENHANCE SERVICE LEVELS, GAIN INCREMENTAL SALES AND INCREASE MARKET PENETRATION. OUR NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED APPROXIMATELY 13.5% OF OUR EXISTING STORES DURING FISCAL 2006, WHICH HAD A NEGATIVE

IMPACT TO RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.9%.

DESPITE

THE DIFFICULT U.S. RETAIL HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKET, WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL SERVICES REVENUE, WHICH INCREASED 8.3% TO $3.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $3.5 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2005. THE GROWTH IN RETAIL SERVICES REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN A NUMBER OF AREAS INCLUDING COUNTERTOPS, EXTERIOR PATIOS, SOLAR, WINDOWS AND HVAC. OUR RETAIL SERVICES PROGRAMS FOCUS

PRIMARILY ON PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS. OUR SERVICES REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE GROWING PERCENTAGE OF AGING

"BABY-BOOMERS" AS THEY RELY MORE HEAVILY ON INSTALLATION SERVICES.

22

NET

SALES FOR OUR HD SUPPLY SEGMENT FOR FISCAL 2006 WERE $12.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 162% OVER FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS. ORGANIC NET SALES

GROWTH FOR THE HD SUPPLY SEGMENT WAS 5.6% IN FISCAL 2006, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF COMMODITY PRICE INFLATION AND MARKET SHARE GAINS.

WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR SALES PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN, AND COULD CONTINUE TO BE, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS MARKETS. DUE TO THE HIGHLY-FRAGMENTED U.S. HOME

IMPROVEMENT AND PROFESSIONAL SUPPLY INDUSTRY, IN WHICH WE ESTIMATE OUR MARKET SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY 10%, MEASURING THE IMPACT ON OUR SALES BY OUR COMPETITORS IS DIFFICULT.

GROSS PROFIT

TOTAL GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 9.0% TO $29.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $27.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES DECREASED 73 BASIS

POINTS TO 32.8% FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 33.5% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE DECLINE IN TOTAL GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER PENETRATION OF THE LOWER MARGIN HD SUPPLY

SEGMENT. IN FISCAL 2006, 65 BASIS POINTS OF THE TOTAL GROSS PROFIT DECLINE WAS A RESULT OF A HIGHER PENETRATION OF HD SUPPLY BUSINESSES AS WELL AS A DROP IN HD SUPPLY'S GROSS PROFIT RATE DUE TO A

CHANGE IN THE MIX OF BUSINESSES OWNED.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 12.0% TO $20.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $18.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WERE 22.1%

FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 22.0% FOR FISCAL 2005.

SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A") INCREASED 11.3% TO $18.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $16.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 20.2% FOR

FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE IN SG&A DURING FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE TO ADDED ASSOCIATE LABOR HOURS ON THE FLOOR OF OUR STORES, INCREASED SPENDING ON STORE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND THE

EXPANSION OF MERCHANDISE DISPLAY RESETS. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SELF-INSURANCE COSTS AS WE CONTINUE TO REALIZE BENEFITS FROM SAFETY PROGRAMS AND OTHER INITIATIVES.

FISCAL 2006 SG&A ALSO REFLECTS BENEFITS FROM OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD, WHICH CARRIES A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE THAN OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT, LIKE BANK CARDS. THROUGH OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD WE

OFFER NO INTEREST/NO PAYMENT PROGRAMS. THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES. WE BELIEVE THESE PROGRAMS DELIVER LONG-TERM BENEFITS,

INCLUDING HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY. FOR FISCAL 2006, THE PENETRATION OF OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT SALES WAS 28.0% COMPARED TO 25.6% FOR FISCAL 2005.

ALSO

IMPACTING OUR SG&A IN FISCAL 2006 IS EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE OF $129 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 123(R),

"SHARE-BASED PAYMENT" ("SFAS 123(R)"), WHEREBY WE RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION OF STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CONTINUED VESTING OF OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO FISCAL

2003. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN SG&A WAS $91 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND EXPENSE RELATED TO LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSING OF 20 EXPO STORES IN FISCAL 2005.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 19.7% TO $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $1.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.9% FOR

FISCAL 2006 AND 1.8% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AS PART OF OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND THE DEPRECIATION

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY.

23

INTEREST, NET

IN FISCAL 2006, WE RECOGNIZED $365 MILLION OF NET INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO $81 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.4%

FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO 0.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCURRED RELATED TO THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE OF $1.0 BILLION OF 5.20% SENIOR NOTES

AND $3.0 BILLION OF 5.40% SENIOR NOTES AND THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES, $1.25 BILLION OF 5.25% SENIOR NOTES AND

$3.0 BILLION OF 5.875% SENIOR NOTES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED TO 38.1% FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM 37.1% FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF A RETROACTIVE TAX ASSESSMENT FROM THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF QUEBEC. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, THE QUEBEC NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED

LEGISLATION THAT RETROACTIVELY CHANGED CERTAIN TAX LAWS THAT SUBJECTED US TO ADDITIONAL TAX AND INTEREST. AS A RESULT, WE RECEIVED AN ASSESSMENT FROM QUEBEC FOR $57 MILLION IN RETROACTIVE TAX

AND $12 MILLION IN RELATED INTEREST FOR THE 2002 THROUGH 2005 TAXABLE YEARS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $2.79 FOR FISCAL 2006 AND $2.72 FOR FISCAL 2005. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN BOTH FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005 BY THE

REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR $17.5 BILLION REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN 2002, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 451 MILLION SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $16.4 BILLION, INCLUDING $5 BILLION THROUGH ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASES IN FISCAL 2006. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, WE HAD $1.1 BILLION REMAINING

UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 30, 2005 ("FISCAL 2004")

NET SALES

NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2005 INCREASED 11.5% TO $81.5 BILLION FROM $73.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. FISCAL 2005 NET SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN RETAIL

COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF 3.1%, SALES FROM NEW STORES OPENED DURING FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004 AND SALES FROM OUR NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITHIN HD SUPPLY.

THE

INCREASE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN FISCAL 2005 REFLECTS A NUMBER OF FACTORS. OUR AVERAGE TICKET, WHICH INCREASED 5.6% TO $57.98, INCREASED IN ALL SELLING DEPARTMENTS AND OUR RETAIL

COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH IN FISCAL 2005 WAS POSITIVE IN 9 OF 10 SELLING DEPARTMENTS. BUILDING MATERIALS HAD THE STRONGEST RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASE THROUGH SALES GROWTH OF GYPSUM,

ROOFING, CONCRETE AND INSULATION, DUE IN PART TO THE IMPACT OF ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE HURRICANE SEASONS IN MODERN U.S. HISTORY. WE EXPERIENCED STRONG RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH IN

KITCHEN AND BATH DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN APPLIANCES AND KITCHEN INSTALLATIONS. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED STRONG RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN OUR PRO CATEGORIES, INCLUDING PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL AND

HARDWARE IN FISCAL 2005. THE IMPACT OF CANNIBALIZATION PARTIALLY OFFSET OUR FISCAL 2005 RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2005, CERTAIN NEW STORES CANNIBALIZED

APPROXIMATELY 20% OF OUR EXISTING STORES AND WE ESTIMATE THAT STORE CANNIBALIZATION REDUCED FISCAL 2005 RETAIL COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 1.8%.

THE

GROWTH IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2005 ALSO REFLECTS GROWTH IN SERVICES REVENUE, WHICH INCREASED 16.6% TO $3.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $3.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. THE GROWTH IN

SERVICES REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY STRENGTH IN A NUMBER OF AREAS INCLUDING COUNTERTOPS, ROOFING, KITCHENS, WINDOWS AND HVAC.

24

GROSS PROFIT

GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 11.8% TO $27.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $24.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS

TO 33.5% FOR FISCAL 2005, THE HIGHEST ANNUAL RATE IN OUR COMPANY'S HISTORY. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS DURING THE

YEAR INCLUDING A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF MERCHANDISE SOLD, MARKDOWNS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH OUR DECISION TO CLOSE 20 EXPO STORES, THE INCREASING PENETRATION OF OUR HD SUPPLY BUSINESS AND THE COST OF

OUR DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS. FOR FISCAL 2005, THE PENETRATION OF OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT SALES WAS 25.6% COMPARED TO 24.1% FOR FISCAL 2004.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 8.8% TO $18.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $16.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WERE 22.0% FOR

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO 22.6% FOR FISCAL 2004.

SG&A

INCREASED 8.1% TO $16.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $15.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS 20.2% FOR FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO 20.9% FOR FISCAL 2004. THE

REDUCTION OF SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CONTINUED FOCUS ON COST TAKE-OUT INITIATIVES AND DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY GAINS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY. WE

ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE BENEFITS FROM OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD, WHICH CARRIES A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE THAN OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT, LIKE BANK CARDS. IN FISCAL 2005, WE RECORDED $52 MILLION OF

INCOME RELATED TO GIFT CARD BREAKAGE AS A REDUCTION OF SG&A. FISCAL 2005 WAS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH WE RECOGNIZED GIFT CARD BREAKAGE, AND THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2005 INCLUDES THE

BREAKAGE INCOME RELATED TO GIFT CARDS SOLD SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR GIFT CARD PROGRAM. FINALLY, FOR FISCAL 2005, WE RECORDED $91 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND EXPENSE RELATED TO LEASE

OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR DECISION TO CLOSE 20 EXPO STORES.

DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED 17.9% TO $1.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $1.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2004. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 1.8% FOR

FISCAL 2005 AND 1.7% FOR FISCAL 2004. THE INCREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN STORE MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY.

INTEREST, NET

IN FISCAL 2005, WE RECOGNIZED $81 MILLION OF NET INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO $14 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS 0.1%

FOR FISCAL 2005 AND LESS THAN 0.1% FOR FISCAL 2004. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $143 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $70 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST

INCURRED RELATED TO THE AUGUST 2005 $1.0 BILLION ISSUANCE OF 4.625% SENIOR NOTES AND THE SEPTEMBER 2004 $1.0 BILLION ISSUANCE OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT

INCOME INCREASED 10.7% TO $62 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM $56 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2004 DUE PRIMARILY TO A HIGHER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

OUR COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED TO 37.1% FOR FISCAL 2005 FROM 36.8% FOR FISCAL 2004. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE STATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2005.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $2.72 AND $2.26 FOR FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004, RESPECTIVELY. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED IN BOTH FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL

2004 AS A RESULT OF THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

25

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. FOR FISCAL 2006, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $7.7 BILLION AS COMPARED

TO $6.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKING CAPITAL IN FISCAL 2006.

NET

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $7.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 FROM $4.6 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS FOR

BUSINESSES ACQUIRED OF $1.7 BILLION AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS OF $1.7 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $339 MILLION DECREASE IN

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE PAID $4.3 BILLION TO COMPLETE 15 ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2006, INCLUDING HUGHES SUPPLY. OUR FISCAL 2006 ACQUISITIONS RESULTED IN INCREASES IN RECEIVABLES, MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES, GOODWILL, OTHER ASSETS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007. SEE NOTE 11 TO OUR "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

ADDITIONALLY

IN FISCAL 2006, WE SPENT $3.5 BILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS: 64% FOR NEW STORES, 11% FOR STORE MODERNIZATION, 6% FOR TECHNOLOGY AND 19% FOR OTHER

INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2006, WE ADDED 125 NEW STORES, INCLUDING 12 STORES IN CHINA THROUGH OUR ACQUISITION OF THE HOME WAY, AND 10 RELOCATIONS.

NET

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS $203 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2005. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO NET PROCEEDS OF $7.6 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET INCREASE OF $4.2 BILLION IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH

DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS.

IN

FEBRUARY 2006, MAY 2006 AND AUGUST 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $1.0 BILLION, $2.0 BILLION AND $3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN OUR

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, BRINGING THE TOTAL AUTHORIZATION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SINCE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN 2002 TO $17.5 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007. PURSUANT TO THIS

AUTHORIZATION, WE HAVE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 451 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A TOTAL OF $16.4 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007. DURING FISCAL 2006, WE REPURCHASED

APPROXIMATELY 174 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $6.7 BILLION AND DURING FISCAL 2005 WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 76 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR

$3.0 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING FISCAL 2006, WE ALSO INCREASED DIVIDENDS PAID BY 62.8% TO

$1.4 BILLION FROM $857 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005.

WE

HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.5 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, WE HAVE A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR

BORROWINGS UP TO $2.0 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM OR THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES

IN DECEMBER 2010, CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

WE

USE CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING OUR STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS AND STORE SUPPORT CENTERS. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF CAPITAL

LEASE OBLIGATIONS IS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LONG-TERM DEBT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2006, OUR LONG-TERM DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 46.5% COMPARED TO 9.9% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2005. THIS

INCREASE REFLECTS THE NET INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES IN MARCH AND DECEMBER OF FISCAL 2006.

AS

OF JANUARY 28, 2007, WE HAD $614 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE

SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE FUNDS

AVAILABLE FROM THE $2.5 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

26

IN

MARCH 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2016. UPON ISSUANCE OF THE HEDGED DEBT, WE SETTLED OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT AND

RECORDED A $12 MILLION DECREASE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED DEBT.

IN

MAY 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A $2 BILLION ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PURSUANT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 53 MILLION SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PURCHASED AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET. THE SHARES REPURCHASED BY US WERE SUBJECT TO A FUTURE

PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER AN AGREED PERIOD, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED COLLAR. IN AUGUST 2006, WE SETTLED THE ACCELERATED SHARE

REPURCHASE. WE ELECTED SETTLEMENT IN CASH AND RECEIVED $61 MILLION FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR COST OF TREASURY STOCK.

IN

OCTOBER 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16, 2036. UPON ISSUANCE OF THE HEDGED DEBT IN DECEMBER 2006, WE SETTLED OUR FORWARD STARTING INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENT AND RECORDED AN $11 MILLION DECREASE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE

RELATED DEBT.

IN

DECEMBER 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A $3 BILLION ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PURSUANT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 75 MILLION SHARES

OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PURCHASED AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET. THE SHARES REPURCHASED BY US WERE SUBJECT TO A

FUTURE PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER AN AGREED PERIOD. IN MARCH 2007, WE SETTLED THE ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE. WE ELECTED

SETTLEMENT IN CASH AND RECEIVED $36 MILLION FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR COST OF TREASURY STOCK IN FISCAL 2007.

(4)

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE STORE ASSETS. WE ISSUE LETTERS

OF CREDIT FOR

INSURANCE PROGRAMS, PURCHASES OF IMPORT MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. OUR PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF COMMITMENTS FOR BOTH MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.

(5)

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE ALL LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACTS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS FOR INVENTORY PURCHASES, UTILITY PURCHASES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SOFTWARE

ACQUISITION AND LICENSE

COMMITMENTS AND LEGALLY BINDING SERVICE CONTRACTS. PURCHASE ORDERS THAT ARE NOT BINDING AGREEMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE INCLUDED A COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE THE

UNDERLYING ASSET UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET LEASE RELATED TO CERTAIN STORES FOR $282 MILLION DURING 2008.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING ENTITIES, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES, AS

WELL AS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE DEBT.

AS

OF JANUARY 28, 2007 WE HAD, NET OF DISCOUNTS, $10.9 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING. THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED SENIOR NOTES AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, WERE

APPROXIMATELY $10.9 BILLION.

IMPACT OF INFLATION, DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INFLATION AND DEFLATION RELATED TO OUR PURCHASE OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS. DURING FISCAL 2006, LUMBER PRICES DECREASED OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY

APPROXIMATELY 43 BASIS

28

POINTS.

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGING PRICES FOR COMMODITIES HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF

INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE INFLATION AND DEFLATION HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR USE OF COMPLEX ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. WE ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS

BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE FOR SALES RETURNS IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF FUTURE RETURNS. WE HAVE NEVER RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ESTIMATED

LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS. HOWEVER, IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS, OUR SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WHEN WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER

HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE

IS COMPLETE.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, WITH APPROXIMATELY 80% VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY

METHOD AND THE REMAINDER UNDER THE COST METHOD. RETAILERS LIKE THE HOME DEPOT, WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MERCHANDISE AT LOW UNIT COST AND A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, FREQUENTLY USE THE RETAIL

INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT COST, WHICH IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE ENDING RETAIL

VALUE OF INVENTORIES. AS OUR INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WE

EVALUATE OUR INVENTORY VALUED UNDER THE COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED

UNDER THE COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005.

INDEPENDENT

PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE, DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND HD SUPPLY LOCATION TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN OUR STORES, WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO SHRINK

ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK

MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ESTIMATE SHRINK AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES USING THE AVERAGE SHRINK

RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO PHYSICAL INVENTORIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE EVALUATED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTED BASED ON RECENT SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS.

SELF-INSURANCE

WE ARE SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. OUR LIABILITY

REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS ESTABLISHED BASED

29

UPON

ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, AND IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THE LIABILITY IS APPROPRIATE. WHILE WE BELIEVE

THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, IF ACTUAL TRENDS, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OR FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PREMIUMS,

DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE

PROMOTION OF VENDORS' PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS

EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF VENDOR

ALLOWANCES EARNED BASED ON EXPECTED VOLUME OF PURCHASES OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE ULTIMATE ALLOWANCE TO BE RECEIVED FROM OUR VENDORS.

VOLUME

REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT

IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS' PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET

AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, "CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS

WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 ADDRESSES THE PROCESS OF QUANTIFYING PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CURRENT

YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 108 ALLOW COMPANIES TO REPORT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CORRECTING IMMATERIAL PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL METHOD FOR

EVALUATING MISSTATEMENTS, BY ADJUSTING THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RATHER THAN AMENDING PREVIOUSLY FILED REPORTS. SAB 108 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE

OF THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ERROR BEING CORRECTED, HOW THE EVENT AROSE AND THE FACT THAT THE ERRORS ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL TO THE PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SAB 108 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2006, AND THEREFORE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE HOME DEPOT IN FISCAL 2006. SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS" INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN

JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAX REPORTING BY PRESCRIBING A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 REQUIRES THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A TAX

POSITION ONLY IF THAT POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. ADDITIONALLY, FIN 48 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION,

CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. FIN 48 BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2006, AND WILL THEREFORE BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE HOME DEPOT IN FISCAL 2007. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 48 IN FISCAL 2007 IS NOT EXPECTED

TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOME

DEPOT, INC. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PROPERLY REFLECT CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED UPON THE

BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. THEIR ACCOMPANYING REPORT IS BASED UPON AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONSISTING SOLELY OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS, MEETS FIVE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, THE INTERNAL AUDITORS AND

REPRESENTATIVES OF MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS. IN ADDITION, A TELEPHONIC MEETING IS HELD PRIOR TO EACH QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE RETAINS THE

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REGULARLY REVIEWS THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND INTERNAL AUDITORS AND THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

COMPANY. BOTH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN

RULE 13A-15(F) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED

ON OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007 IN PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. OUR MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN ITS REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED

HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE HOME DEPOT, INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT AND AN

OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE "COMPANY") OPERATE THE HOME DEPOT STORES, WHICH ARE FULL-SERVICE, WAREHOUSE-STYLE STORES AVERAGING

APPROXIMATELY 105,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE. THE STORES STOCK APPROXIMATELY 35,000 TO 45,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, HOME IMPROVEMENT SUPPLIES AND LAWN AND GARDEN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD

TO DO-IT-YOURSELF CUSTOMERS, DO-IT-FOR-ME CUSTOMERS, HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS, TRADESPEOPLE AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES ("EXPO"), WHICH OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY RELATED TO DESIGN AND RENOVATION PROJECTS, AND THE HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES,

WHICH SERVICE LANDSCAPE PROFESSIONALS AND GARDEN ENTHUSIASTS WITH LAWN, LANDSCAPE AND GARDEN PRODUCTS. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY WAS OPERATING 2,147 STORES IN TOTAL, WHICH INCLUDED 1,872

THE HOME DEPOT STORES, 34 EXPO DESIGN CENTER STORES, 11 THE HOME DEPOT LANDSCAPE SUPPLY STORES AND TWO THE HOME DEPOT FLOOR STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE TERRITORIES OF PUERTO RICO AND

THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ("U.S."), 155 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CANADA, 61 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN MEXICO AND 12 THE HOME DEPOT STORES IN CHINA.

ADDITIONALLY,

HD SUPPLY, THROUGH THE COMPANY'S WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS AND SELLS INSTALLATION SERVICES PRIMARILY TO BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING HOME BUILDERS, PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTORS, MUNICIPALITIES AND MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS. HD SUPPLY CONSISTS OF FOUR MAJOR PLATFORMS: 1) INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING WATERWORKS AND

UTILITIES; 2) CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY, LUMBER AND BUILDING MATERIALS, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING/HVAC

AND INTERIORS; 3) MAINTENANCE, INCLUDING FACILITIES MAINTENANCE AND INDUSTRIAL PVF; AND 4) REPAIR AND REMODEL.

THE

COMPANY OPERATES ITS BUSINESS IN TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, RETAIL AND HD SUPPLY. SEE NOTE 12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S SEGMENTS. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE

THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

FISCAL YEAR

THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31. FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 28,

2007 ("FISCAL 2006"), JANUARY 29, 2006 ("FISCAL 2005") AND JANUARY 30, 2005 ("FISCAL 2004") INCLUDE 52 WEEKS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN PREPARING THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM

MATURITIES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION "SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS" IN THIS NOTE 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4.

38

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CARRIED

AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HIGH-GRADE COMMERCIAL PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES AND TAX-EXEMPT NOTES AND BONDS.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE ARE INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), NET OF APPLICABLE TAXES, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY INVESTS IN AUCTION

RATE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH LONG-TERM SCHEDULED MATURITIES AND PERIODIC INTEREST RATE RESET DATES. THE INTEREST RATES ON THESE SECURITIES ARE TYPICALLY RESET TO MARKET

PREVAILING RATES EVERY 35 DAYS OR LESS, AND IN ALL CASES EVERY 90 DAYS OR LESS. DUE TO THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDED BY THE INTEREST RATE RESET MECHANISM AND THE SHORT-TERM NATURE

OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN THESE SECURITIES, THEY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER WHO DIRECTLY EXTENDS CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS AND MANAGES THE COMPANY'S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY EXTEND CREDIT DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS WERE $1.8 BILLION AND

$865 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007 AND JANUARY 29, 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS DETERMINED BY THE RETAIL

INVENTORY METHOD. AS THE INVENTORY RETAIL VALUE IS ADJUSTED REGULARLY TO REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE RETAIL METHOD APPROXIMATES THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. CERTAIN

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING RETAIL OPERATIONS IN MEXICO AND CHINA, AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS RECORD MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET, AS

DETERMINED BY THE COST

METHOD. THESE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE TOTAL MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES BALANCE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE INVENTORY VALUED USING THE COST METHOD AT THE END OF EACH

QUARTER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES VALUED UNDER THE COST METHOD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005.

INDEPENDENT

PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS OR CYCLE COUNTS ARE TAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS IN EACH STORE, DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND HD SUPPLY LOCATION TO ENSURE THAT AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE PROPERLY STATED. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS IN STORES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO

SHRINK ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINK RESULTS AND CURRENT TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. SHRINK (OR IN THE CASE OF EXCESS INVENTORY, "SWELL") IS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE RECORDED AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AND THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY. SHRINK MAY OCCUR DUE TO THEFT, LOSS, INACCURATE RECORDS FOR THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY OR DETERIORATION OF GOODS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

39

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE, AS WELL AS FOR THOSE DEFERRED DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPORTING INCOME AND

EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES VERSUS TAX PURPOSES. FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX BENEFITS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED INCOME TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN INCOME TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME OR EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE.

THE

COMPANY AND ITS ELIGIBLE SUBSIDIARIES FILE A CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. SEPARATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED FOR THESE

ENTITIES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST THE UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF ITS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND POSTPONE THEIR REMITTANCE INDEFINITELY. ACCORDINGLY, NO PROVISION FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES

FOR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WAS RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE COMPANY'S BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE IMPROVEMENT, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER. THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND

EQUIPMENT IS DEPRECIATED USING THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

LIFE

BUILDINGS

10-45 YEARS

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3-20 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

5-45 YEARS

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND AMORTIZES THESE COSTS USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH IS THREE TO SIX YEARS. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CERTAIN

DEVELOPMENT COSTS NOT MEETING THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

REVENUES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE, NET OF ESTIMATED RETURNS, AT THE TIME THE CUSTOMER TAKES POSSESSION OF MERCHANDISE OR RECEIVES SERVICES. THE LIABILITY FOR SALES RETURNS IS

ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN LEVELS. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE MERCHANDISE OR THE SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, THE AMOUNT

RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS UNTIL THE SALE OR SERVICE IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS AND

RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE UPON THE REDEMPTION OF GIFT CARDS IN NET SALES. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME IS RECOGNIZED BASED UPON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION PATTERNS AND REPRESENTS THE BALANCE OF GIFT CARDS FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDEMPTION BY THE CUSTOMER IS REMOTE. DURING FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $33 MILLION AND $52 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

OF GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. FISCAL

40

2005

WAS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME, AND THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED INCLUDES THE GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME RELATED TO GIFT CARDS SOLD SINCE THE

INCEPTION OF THE GIFT CARD PROGRAM. THIS INCOME IS RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME AND IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AS A REDUCTION IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("SG&A").

SERVICES REVENUE

NET SALES INCLUDE SERVICES REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION, HOME MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS. IN THESE PROGRAMS, THE CUSTOMER SELECTS AND

PURCHASES MATERIAL FOR A PROJECT AND THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S STORES AND CERTAIN HD SUPPLY LOCATIONS. UNDER CERTAIN

PROGRAMS, WHEN THE COMPANY PROVIDES OR ARRANGES THE INSTALLATION OF A PROJECT AND THE SUBCONTRACTOR PROVIDES MATERIAL AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION, BOTH THE MATERIAL AND LABOR ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES

REVENUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETE.

ALL

PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF SERVICES ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RETAIL SERVICES REVENUE WAS $3.8 BILLION,

$3.5 BILLION AND $3.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR CERTAIN LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS. THE EXPECTED

ULTIMATE COST FOR CLAIMS INCURRED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IS NOT DISCOUNTED AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY. THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL

DATA AND ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES.

PREPAID ADVERTISING

TELEVISION AND RADIO ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ALONG WITH MEDIA PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT FIRST APPEARS. INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE

ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE $44 MILLION AND $42 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006 AND 2005 RELATING TO PREPAYMENTS OF PRODUCTION COSTS FOR PRINT AND

BROADCAST ADVERTISING.

VENDOR ALLOWANCES

VENDOR ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF VOLUME REBATES THAT ARE EARNED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES FOR THE

PROMOTION OF VENDORS' PRODUCTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON GUARANTEED MINIMUM AMOUNTS WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS BEING EARNED FOR ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS. THESE VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE ACCRUED AS

EARNED, WITH THOSE ALLOWANCES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ATTAINING CERTAIN PURCHASE LEVELS ACCRUED OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PURCHASES.

VOLUME

REBATES AND ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES EARNED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES AND A SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT

IS SOLD. CERTAIN ADVERTISING CO-OP ALLOWANCES THAT ARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF SPECIFIC, INCREMENTAL AND IDENTIFIABLE COSTS INCURRED TO PROMOTE VENDORS' PRODUCTS ARE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET

AGAINST ADVERTISING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, NET ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.1 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN SG&A.

COST OF SALES

COST OF SALES INCLUDES THE ACTUAL COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD AND SERVICES PERFORMED, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION OF MERCHANDISE FROM VENDORS TO THE COMPANY'S STORES, LOCATIONS OR

CUSTOMERS, THE

41

OPERATING

COST OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND THE COST OF DEFERRED INTEREST PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM.

THE

COST OF HANDLING AND SHIPPING MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANY'S STORES, LOCATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE CUSTOMER IS CLASSIFIED AS SG&A. THE COST OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING, INCLUDING INTERNAL

COSTS AND PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES, CLASSIFIED AS SG&A WAS $741 MILLION, $563 MILLION AND $499 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL, BUT DOES ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF

GOODWILL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT SUPPORTS ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANY'S IDENTIFIED REPORTING UNITS

WERE ESTIMATED USING THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

THE

COMPANY AMORTIZES THE COST OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE FROM 1 TO 14 YEARS, UNLESS SUCH LIVES ARE DEEMED INDEFINITE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005 OR 2004.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN MANAGEMENT MAKES THE DECISION TO RELOCATE OR CLOSE A STORE OR OTHER LOCATION, OR WHEN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. LOSSES RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED TO THE EXTENT THE SUM OF UNDISCOUNTED

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET ARE LESS THAN THE ASSET'S CARRYING VALUE. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, A PROVISION IS MADE TO WRITE DOWN THE RELATED ASSETS TO THE ESTIMATED NET RECOVERABLE VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WERE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

SG&A IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. WHEN A LOCATION CLOSES, THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES IN SG&A THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, LESS ESTIMATED SUBLEASE

INCOME.

IN

FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED $91 MILLION IN SG&A RELATED TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND ON-GOING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSING OF 20 OF ITS EXPO STORES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED $29 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN COST OF SALES IN FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO INVENTORY MARKDOWNS IN THESE STORES. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS ON OTHER CLOSINGS

AND RELOCATIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 3, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF RECORDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION" ("SFAS 123"). THE COMPANY SELECTED THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION AS DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 148,

"ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE," AND ACCORDINGLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED, MODIFIED OR

SETTLED AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ("ESPP") AFTER THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 30, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R), "SHARE-BASED PAYMENT" ("SFAS 123(R)"), USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, THE COMPANY

BEGAN EXPENSING UNVESTED OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO FISCAL 2003 IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING TO RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AWARDED SINCE THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123 IN FISCAL 2003. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

42

ADDITIONAL

STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123(R). AS THE MAJORITY OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2003 ARE NOW FULLY

VESTED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT SFAS 123(R) TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL 2006. RESULTS OF PRIOR PERIODS

HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED.

THE

PER SHARE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED DURING FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS $11.88, $12.83 AND $13.57, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS WAS DETERMINED AT THE

DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES." THERE WERE NO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AS OF

JANUARY 28, 2007.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INCLUDES NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN REVENUES, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET EARNINGS UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. ADJUSTMENTS TO NET EARNINGS ARE PRIMARILY FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND INTEREST RATE HEDGES.

43

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT THE CURRENT RATE OF EXCHANGE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. REVENUES AND

EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY TRANSLATED AT A DAILY EXCHANGE RATE AND EQUITY TRANSACTIONS ARE TRANSLATED USING THE ACTUAL RATE ON THE DAY OF THE TRANSACTION.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR FISCAL YEARS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE PRESENTATION ADOPTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

2.     STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108

IN

SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, "CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING

MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 ADDRESSES THE PROCESS OF QUANTIFYING PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 108 ALLOW COMPANIES TO REPORT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CORRECTING IMMATERIAL PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL METHOD FOR EVALUATING

MISSTATEMENTS, BY ADJUSTING THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RATHER THAN

AMENDING PREVIOUSLY FILED REPORTS. SAB 108 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2006, AND THEREFORE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE HOME DEPOT IN FISCAL 2006. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SAB 108, THE COMPANY HAS ADJUSTED BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE ITEMS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE

ADJUSTMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANY OF THE PRIOR YEARS AFFECTED.

HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REQUESTED THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEW ITS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNDERTOOK THE

REVIEW WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE COUNSEL, AND IT HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW. THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF THE REVIEW ARE AS FOLLOWS.



ALL

OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE PERIOD FROM 2002 THROUGH THE PRESENT HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE THE GRANT WAS APPROVED BY

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AN OFFICER ACTING PURSUANT TO DELEGATED AUTHORITY. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT CORRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY AND WITHOUT SEPARATE

APPROVALS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS INCLUDED INADVERTENT OMISSIONS OF GRANTEES FROM LISTS THAT WERE APPROVED PREVIOUSLY AND MISCALCULATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO PARTICULAR EMPLOYEES ON

APPROVED LISTS.



ALL

OPTIONS GRANTED FROM DECEMBER 1, 2000 THROUGH THE END OF 2001 HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF A MEETING OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR SOME OTHER DATE SELECTED WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. THE FEBRUARY 2001 ANNUAL GRANT WAS NOT FINALLY ALLOCATED TO RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE GRANT

WAS APPROVED. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ALSO CORRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS RETROACTIVELY AND WITHOUT SEPARATE APPROVALS AS IN THE PERIOD 2002 TO THE PRESENT.



FOR

ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS AND CERTAIN QUARTERLY OPTION GRANTS FROM 1981 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2000, THE STATED GRANT DATE WAS ROUTINELY EARLIER THAN THE ACTUAL DATE ON

WHICH THE GRANTS WERE APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE, THE STOCK PRICE ON THE APPARENT APPROVAL DATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE ON THE STATED GRANT DATE. THE

BACKDATING

44

OCCURRED

FOR GRANTS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE COMPANY. MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE SINCE LEFT THE COMPANY, GENERALLY FOLLOWED A PRACTICE OF REVIEWING CLOSING PRICES FOR A PRIOR PERIOD AND SELECTING A

DATE WITH A LOW STOCK PRICE TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE OPTIONS TO EMPLOYEES ON LISTS OF GRANTEES SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.



THE

ANNUAL OPTION GRANTS IN 1994 THROUGH 2000, AS WELL AS MANY QUARTERLY GRANTS DURING THIS PERIOD, WERE NOT FINALLY ALLOCATED AMONG THE RECIPIENTS UNTIL SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER

THE STATED GRANT DATE. BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF RECORDS PRIOR TO 1994, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ALLOCATIONS ALSO POSTDATED THE SELECTED GRANT DATES FROM 1981 THROUGH 1993. MOREOVER, FOR MANY OF THESE

ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY GRANTS FROM 1981 THROUGH DECEMBER 2000, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHEN THE GRANTS WERE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS. FINALLY, THE COMPANY'S STOCK ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ALSO RETROACTIVELY ADDED EMPLOYEES TO LISTS OF APPROVED GRANTEES, OR CHANGED THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES,

WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR A BOARD COMMITTEE, TO CORRECT ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS.



NUMEROUS

OPTION GRANTS TO RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES WERE MADE PURSUANT TO DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE UNDER DELAWARE LAW.



IN

NUMEROUS INSTANCES, AND PRIMARILY PRIOR TO 2003, BENEFICIARIES OF GRANTS WHO WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEM TO THE SEC FAILED TO DO SO IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.



THE

SUBCOMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING BY ANY CURRENT MEMBER OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TEAM OR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THESE ERRORS, IT HAD UNRECORDED EXPENSE OVER THE AFFECTED PERIOD (1981 THROUGH 2005) OF $227 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, INCLUDING RELATED TAX ITEMS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SAB 108, THE COMPANY DECREASED BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2006 BY $227 MILLION WITHIN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE STAFF OF THE SEC HAS BEGUN AN INFORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HAS ALSO REQUESTED

INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO COOPERATE WITH THESE AGENCIES. WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECT OF THE STOCK OPTION ADJUSTMENT WAS MATERIAL, EITHER QUANTITATIVELY OR QUALITATIVELY, IN ANY OF THE YEARS COVERED BY THE REVIEW OF THESE ITEMS. IN

REACHING THAT DETERMINATION, THE FOLLOWING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES WERE CONSIDERED (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

4.     DEBT

THE

COMPANY HAS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.5 BILLION. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN FISCAL 2006 AND 2005 WERE MADE UNDER THIS

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, THE COMPANY HAS A BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.0 BILLION.

THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2010, CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

"DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE." THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO FUND, IN PART, THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE $49 MILLION DISCOUNT AND $37 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE

TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

ADDITIONALLY

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO

HEDGE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 16, 2036. UPON ISSUANCE OF THE HEDGED DEBT IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY SETTLED

ITS FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AND RECORDED AN $11 MILLION DECREASE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, TO ACCUMULATED

47

OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED DEBT.

IN

MARCH 2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 5.20% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2011 AT A DISCOUNT OF $1 MILLION AND $3.0 BILLION OF 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE

MARCH 1, 2016 AT A DISCOUNT OF $15 MILLION, TOGETHER THE "MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE." THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE WERE USED TO PAY FOR THE ACQUISITION PRICE OF

HUGHES SUPPLY, INC. AND FOR THE REPAYMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 5.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE APRIL 2006 IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION. THE $16 MILLION DISCOUNT

AND $19 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

ADDITIONALLY

IN MARCH 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.0 BILLION, ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, TO HEDGE

INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE 5.40% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2016. UPON ISSUANCE OF THE HEDGED DEBT, THE COMPANY SETTLED ITS FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENTS AND RECORDED A $12 MILLION DECREASE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED

DEBT.

IN

AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF 4.625% NOTES DUE AUGUST 15, 2010 ("AUGUST 2005 ISSUANCE") AT A DISCOUNT OF $5 MILLION. THE NET PROCEEDS OF

$995 MILLION WERE USED TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE ACQUISITION PRICE OF NATIONAL WATERWORKS, INC. THE $5 MILLION DISCOUNT AND $7 MILLION OF ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE AUGUST 2005 ISSUANCE ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED SENIOR NOTES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAD $1.0 BILLION OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2009 OUTSTANDING AS OF JANUARY 28, 2007, COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO WITH THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE,

MARCH 2006 ISSUANCE AND AUGUST 2005 ISSUANCE AS "SENIOR NOTES." THE SENIOR NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PLUS ACCRUED

INTEREST UP TO THE REDEMPTION DATE. THE REDEMPTION PRICE IS EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (1) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED, OR (2) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT

VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TO MATURITY. ADDITIONALLY, IF A CHANGE IN CONTROL TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURS, AS DEFINED BY THE TERMS OF THE DECEMBER 2006

ISSUANCE, HOLDERS OF THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REDEEM THOSE NOTES AT 101% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST UP TO

THE REDEMPTION DATE.

THE

COMPANY IS GENERALLY NOT LIMITED UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES IN ITS ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS OR SPECIFIED LEVELS OF NET

WORTH OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE SENIOR NOTES CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, NONE OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

INTEREST

EXPENSE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS IS NET OF INTEREST CAPITALIZED OF $47 MILLION, $51 MILLION AND $40 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT ARE $18 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, $301 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2008, $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009, $1.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL

2010, $1.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 AND $7.5 BILLION THEREAFTER.

AS

OF JANUARY 28, 2007, THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SENIOR NOTES WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.9 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL OTHER LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, EXCLUDING CAPITAL

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $316 MILLION COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF $311 MILLION. THESE FAIR VALUES WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS BASED ON THE

COMPANY'S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BASED UPON THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL GENERATE THE NECESSARY TAXABLE INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS AND,

ACCORDINGLY, NO VALUATION RESERVES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS THAT WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $118 MILLION WERE

RECORDED IN FISCAL 2006 REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOK VALUE AND THE TAX BASIS OF ACQUIRED ASSETS.

50

AT

JANUARY 28, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD STATE AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS TO REDUCE FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH WILL EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES FROM 2010 TO 2026. MANAGEMENT HAS

CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THESE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE NET OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE REALIZED AND HENCE NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED

FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON $1.2 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE OF ITS INTENTION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE; HOWEVER, UNRECOGNIZED FOREIGN INCOME TAX CREDITS WOULD BE

AVAILABLE TO REDUCE A PORTION OF THIS LIABILITY.

THE

COMPANY'S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE ROUTINELY UNDER AUDIT BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THESE AUDITS INCLUDE QUESTIONS REGARDING ITS TAX FILING POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT

OF DEDUCTIONS AND THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. IN 2005, THE IRS COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH FISCAL 2002. CERTAIN

ISSUES RELATING TO THE EXAMINATIONS OF FISCAL 2001 AND 2002 ARE UNDER APPEAL, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING 2006, THE IRS

INITIATED AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AND 2004 INCOME TAX RETURNS. THIS AUDIT WILL LIKELY NOT BE COMPLETELY SETTLED UNTIL AFTER FISCAL 2007. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE

RESULTS OF THE AUDIT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, THE QUEBEC NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED LEGISLATION THAT RETROACTIVELY CHANGED CERTAIN TAX LAWS THAT SUBJECTED THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL TAX AND INTEREST. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN ASSESSMENT FROM QUEBEC FOR $57 MILLION IN RETROACTIVE TAX AND $12 MILLION IN RELATED INTEREST FOR THE 2002 THROUGH 2005 TAXABLE YEARS. THIS

RETROACTIVE TAX IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CURRENT YEAR FOREIGN TAX EXPENSE.

IN

JULY 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAX REPORTING BY PRESCRIBING A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 REQUIRES THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A TAX

POSITION ONLY IF THAT POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. ADDITIONALLY, FIN 48 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION,

CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION. FIN 48 BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2006, AND WILL

THEREFORE BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE HOME DEPOT IN FISCAL 2007. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 48 IN FISCAL 2007 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY.

6.     EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS

THE

HOME DEPOT, INC. 2005 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN ("2005 PLAN") AND THE HOME DEPOT, INC. 1997 OMNIBUS STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN ("1997 PLAN") (COLLECTIVELY THE "PLANS") PROVIDE THAT

RECORDED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK OF $95 MILLION, $32 MILLION AND $22 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THERE WERE 417,000, 461,000 AND 461,000 DEFERRED SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, GRANTED UNDER THE PLANS. EACH DEFERRED SHARE ENTITLES THE ASSOCIATE TO ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

7.     LEASES

THE

COMPANY LEASES CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS, OFFICE SPACE, WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION SPACE, EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. WHILE MOST OF THE LEASES ARE OPERATING LEASES, CERTAIN LOCATIONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE

LEASED UNDER CAPITAL LEASES. AS LEASES EXPIRE, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CERTAIN LEASES WILL BE RENEWED OR REPLACED.

CERTAIN

LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ESCALATING RENTS OVER THE LEASE TERMS. THE COMPANY EXPENSES RENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE WHICH COMMENCES ON THE DATE THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE PROPERTY. THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE

53

CUMULATIVE

PAYMENTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE

COMPANY HAS A LEASE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY LEASES CERTAIN ASSETS TOTALING $282 MILLION. THIS LEASE WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED UNDER A STRUCTURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND INVOLVES

TWO SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES. THE COMPANY FINANCED A PORTION OF ITS NEW STORES OPENED IN FISCAL YEARS 1997 THROUGH 2003 UNDER THIS LEASE AGREEMENT. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE LESSOR PURCHASED

THE

PROPERTIES, PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY LEASED THE FACILITIES TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY RECORDS THE RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS AS SG&A IN

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

THE

$282 MILLION LEASE AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN FISCAL 2008 WITH NO RENEWAL OPTION. THE LEASE PROVIDES FOR A SUBSTANTIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE LIMITED TO 79% OF THE INITIAL BOOK VALUE OF THE

ASSETS AND INCLUDES A PURCHASE OPTION AT THE ORIGINAL COST OF EACH PROPERTY. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE THE ASSETS UNDER THIS LEASE FOR

$282 MILLION AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM IN FISCAL 2008.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REVISED VERSION OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 REQUIRES

CONSOLIDATION OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY IF A COMPANY'S VARIABLE INTEREST ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED LOSSES OR RECEIVES A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR

BOTH.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 46, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE ONE OF THE TWO AFOREMENTIONED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES THAT, BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 46, MET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

NON-CONSOLIDATION. THE SECOND SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY THAT OWNS THE ASSETS LEASED BY THE COMPANY TOTALING $282 MILLION IS NOT OWNED BY OR AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY, ITS MANAGEMENT

OR ITS OFFICERS. PURSUANT TO FIN 46, THE COMPANY WAS NOT DEEMED TO HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST, AND THEREFORE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THIS ENTITY.

FIN

46 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MEASURE THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS, WHICH AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IF FIN 46 HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE TRANSACTION.

ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED LONG-TERM DEBT OF $282 MILLION AND LONG-TERM NOTES RECEIVABLE OF $282 MILLION ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECORD THE RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS AS SG&A IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 HAD NO

ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE COMPANY.

TOTAL

RENT EXPENSE, NET OF MINOR SUBLEASE INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS $958 MILLION, $782 MILLION AND $684 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN STORE LEASES ALSO PROVIDE

FOR CONTINGENT RENT PAYMENTS BASED ON PERCENTAGES OF SALES IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED MINIMUMS. CONTINGENT RENT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION,

$9 MILLION AND $11 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING EXPENSES APPLICABLE TO THE LEASED PROPERTY ARE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UNDER THE

LEASE AGREEMENTS.

JANUARY 28, 2007 AND JANUARY 29, 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

8.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS ACTIVE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS FOR ITS EMPLOYEES ("THE BENEFIT PLANS"). ALL ASSOCIATES SATISFYING CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

BENEFIT PLANS. THE COMPANY MAKES CASH CONTRIBUTIONS EACH PAYROLL PERIOD UP TO SPECIFIED PERCENTAGES OF ASSOCIATES' CONTRIBUTIONS AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS A RESTORATION PLAN TO PROVIDE CERTAIN ASSOCIATES DEFERRED COMPENSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS AS A MATCHING CONTRIBUTION IF NOT FOR THE

MAXIMUM COMPENSATION LIMITS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY FUNDS THE RESTORATION PLAN THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO A GRANTOR TRUST, WHICH ARE THEN USED TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET.

THE

COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BENEFIT PLANS AND THE RESTORATION PLAN WERE $159 MILLION, $132 MILLION AND $114 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. AT

JANUARY 28, 2007, THE BENEFIT PLANS AND THE RESTORATION PLAN HELD A TOTAL OF 26 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IN TRUST FOR PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTI-DILUTIVE.

10.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

AT

JANUARY 28, 2007, THE COMPANY WAS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION UNDER OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED FOR CERTAIN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INSURANCE

PROGRAMS, TRADE AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY'S LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY PERFORMANCE-BASED AND ARE NOT BASED ON CHANGES IN VARIABLE COMPONENTS, A LIABILITY OR AN EQUITY SECURITY OF

THE OTHER PARTY.

THE
