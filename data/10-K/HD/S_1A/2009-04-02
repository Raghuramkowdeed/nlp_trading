ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. THE RISK

FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW INCLUDE THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE

POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION

WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS

THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS

REPORT, GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THEM TO BE

MATERIAL. SUCH FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

THE

STATE OF THE HOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS,

RISING COSTS, A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING,

WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD FURTHER

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

IN 2008, THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT MARKETS HAVE DETERIORATED DRAMATICALLY AND MORE

SEVERELY THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. WE EXPECT THE

DETERIORATION TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2009 AND OUR FISCAL 2009 NET

SALES AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

TO DECLINE FROM FISCAL 2008. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING

INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE

COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE STATE OF THE CREDIT

MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER

CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND

OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL  COULD FURTHER

ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS COULD

INCREASE OUR COSTS AND CAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING

OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

WE

RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND

DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED

SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS

PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS

WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR

QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND

EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS,

SUPPLIERS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE

RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT

CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE

MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO

DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED

SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED

BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE

ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR

COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE

PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF

NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE

CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE

GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A

LONG-TERM BANK

LINE-OF-CREDIT

COMMITMENT. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A STRONG INVESTMENT

GRADE RATING AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OBLIGATIONS

AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THE

CURRENT RECESSIONARY TRENDS PERSIST OR WORSEN. CONTINUED

VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED

AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF

CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES

COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE

INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT

FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE

INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW

OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO

OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A BETTER

EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES COULD

DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR

TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED

TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT

TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS,

OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

WE MAY

NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS,

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET

SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS

DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO

EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES.

FAILURE TO DESIGN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR

EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES,

SPENDING PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE

INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR

PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SALES AND PROFIT

MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER

RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION,

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID

AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT OUR SALES

AND PROFIT MARGINS.

OUR

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN

FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING

WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE

REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS

GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TAX REGULATIONS

COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. ALSO, PASSAGE OF THE

EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OR OTHER SIMILAR LAWS IN CONGRESS COULD

LEAD TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS BY ENCOURAGING UNIONIZATION EFFORTS

AMONG OUR ASSOCIATES AND DISRUPTION OF STORE OPERATIONS.

OUR

SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN

HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES.

TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE

NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE CONTROLLING LABOR

COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS

EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND

OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE

IN HOURLY POSITIONS WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH TURNOVER RATES. WE

COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR THESE ASSOCIATES AND

INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. WE

ALSO DEPEND ON OUR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY ASSOCIATES FOR OUR

SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT

OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES

IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES

AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING

MATTERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS

WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR

BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT,

INVENTORIES, LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND

LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE

ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR

THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS,

ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED

OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INCREASED

COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET

SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND

ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A

NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING

AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH

RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES,

LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS,

WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER

RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES

OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN

PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALERS

AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER

BASES. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR

COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND

TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND

OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE

INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT

PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER,

EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS

INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR

REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY,

DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION

AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

THE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND

PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, AND A SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY

BREACH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE PROTECTION OF OUR CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND COMPANY DATA IS

IMPORTANT TO US. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO

INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH

NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE A HIGH EXPECTATION

THAT WE WILL ADEQUATELY PROTECT THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. A

SIGNIFICANT BREACH OF CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE OR COMPANY DATA COULD

DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, FINES AND

LAWSUITS.

ANY

INABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ON SCHEDULE WILL DELAY THE

CONTRIBUTION OF THESE NEW STORES TO OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN CERTAIN EXISTING MARKETS

AND ENTER NEW MARKETS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES WILL

DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE

LOCATIONS, NEGOTIATE LEASES OR REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, ATTRACT AND TRAIN QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, AND MANAGE PRE-OPENING EXPENSES, INCLUDING

CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LOCAL ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER LAWS

RELATED TO LAND USE AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS

WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN STORES ON SCHEDULE, WHICH WILL

DELAY THE IMPACT OF THESE NEW STORES ON OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE

CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES AND THE OPENING OF NEW STORES. OUR ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS

AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN

EXPANDING OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, INTERNATIONAL

EXPANSION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY

AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND

CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS THE

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), LEGAL AND

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE

CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS

INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS,

THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS,

ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FCPA AND

LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON

OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.
