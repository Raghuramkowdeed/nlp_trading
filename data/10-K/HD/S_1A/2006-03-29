ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE

RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND FROM RESULTS PREDICTED BY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY US RELATED TO CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THOSE STATEMENTS MAY RELATE TO

SUCH MATTERS AS NET SALES GROWTH, INCREASES IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, IMPACT OF CANNIBALIZATION, COMMODITY PRICE INFLATION AND DEFLATION, IMPLEMENTATION OF STORE INITIATIVES, PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, NET EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, EARNINGS PER SHARE, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSURES, PAYMENTS ON COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, THE EFFECT OF

ADOPTING CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, FUTURE FINANCIAL REPORTING, FINANCING, MARGINS, RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, OPERATIONS AFTER THE

9

CLOSING

OF THE MERGER WITH HUGHES SUPPLY, THE TIMING AND CERTAINTY OF CLOSING OF THE MERGER WITH HUGHES SUPPLY, THE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE MERGER WITH HUGHES SUPPLY, STRATEGIC

DIRECTION AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY US ARE QUALIFIED BY THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS WE FACE. OUR OPERATIONS

COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR BY FACTORS THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER IMMATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS.

RISING COSTS, A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT, WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COSTS OF

DOING BUSINESS, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR AVERAGE TICKET PRICE.

INTEREST RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, CONSUMER CREDIT AVAILABILITY, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORISM AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT ADVERSELY

AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS COULD.



INCREASE

OUR COSTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY UNDERTAKING OR DETERMINE NOT TO UNDERTAKE NEW HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS,



CAUSE

OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND



LEAD

TO A DECLINE IN AVERAGE TICKET PRICE.

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS, AND IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OUR ABILITY TO

TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR STORE MERCHANDISE FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY

OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS' NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF

WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE

SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIATION.

ANY INABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ON SCHEDULE WILL DELAY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE NEW STORES TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN EXISTING MARKETS AND ENTER NEW MARKETS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO.



IDENTIFY

ATTRACTIVE LOCATIONS,



NEGOTIATE

LEASES OR REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS,



ATTRACT

AND TRAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND



MANAGE

PRE-OPENING EXPENSES, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

10

OUR

ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES ALSO WILL BE AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, LOCAL ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER LAWS RELATED TO LAND USE. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR FACTORS

WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN STORES ON SCHEDULE, WHICH WILL DELAY THE IMPACT OF THESE NEW STORES ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS BOTH IN OUR STORES AND IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO

STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS A BETTER IN-STORE EXPERIENCE. THE COST AND

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR NEW OR

UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR THE TECHNOLOGY MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND

TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES, SPENDING PATTERNS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY. RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT OUR

SALES AND PROFIT MARGINS.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS ON FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE TERMS

AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES. INTEGRATION OF OUR ACQUISITIONS PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING.



DISTRACTION

OF MANAGEMENT FROM REGULAR BUSINESS CONCERNS,



ASSIMILATION

AND RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS,



INTEGRATION

OF TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, AND



ACHIEVEMENT

OF APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THERE

IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING AND INTEGRATING OTHER BUSINESSES.

11

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY INCLUDES EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN EXISTING AND NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND THE OPENING OF NEW

STORES. OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN EXPANDING OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES.

TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE CONTROLLING RELATED LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL

LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES ARE IN HOURLY POSITIONS WITH HISTORICALLY

HIGH TURNOVER RATES. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL AND NON-RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR THESE ASSOCIATES AND INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. WE ALSO DEPEND ON OUR

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY ASSOCIATES FOR OUR SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE

RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, INVENTORIES, SELF-INSURANCE AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES

AND JUDGMENTS BY OUR MANAGEMENT. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS BY OUR MANAGEMENT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED

OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INCREASED COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, BASED PRINCIPALLY ON PRICE, STORE LOCATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEPTH OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER

OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS, WE ALSO COMPETE WITH DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND

NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES OR SHOWROOMS, SOME OF WHICH

ARE ONLY OPEN TO INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALERS AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASES. MOREOVER, OUR HOME DEPOT SUPPLY

BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS AND WHOLESALERS AND MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASES. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE OR MORE OF OUR

COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE PRESSURES, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

12

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY,

SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, WITH CERTAINTY. THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY. ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.
