ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS. THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED

BELOW INCLUDE THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE RELATED POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THESE RISK FACTORS IN CONJUNCTION WITH

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ITEM 7 AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN ITEM 8. THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE CANNOT

ANTICIPATE OR THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT GENERALLY BECAUSE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MATERIAL. THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE STABILITY

OF THE HOUSING, RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS. ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN OR SUSTAINED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THESE MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CAUSING OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELAY PURCHASING OR DETERMINE NOT TO

PURCHASE HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER FACTORS  INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND FORECLOSURES, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, THE

STATE OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY LOANS AND CONSUMER CREDIT, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL  COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OUR COSTS OF

DOING BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

STRONG COMPETITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRICES AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND COULD DECREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.

WE OPERATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON CUSTOMER

SERVICES, PRICE, STORE LOCATION AND ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE. IN EACH MARKET WE SERVE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDING MATERIALS SUPPLY HOUSES AND LUMBER YARDS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME PRODUCTS,

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH SPECIALTY DESIGN STORES, SHOWROOMS, DISCOUNT STORES, LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HARDWARE STORES, MAIL ORDER FIRMS, WAREHOUSE CLUBS, INDEPENDENT BUILDING SUPPLY STORES AND OTHER RETAILERS. INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM ONE

OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT PRICES OR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER

LOYALTY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR MARKET SHARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND

TO CONSUMER NEEDS, EXPECTATIONS OR TRENDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND PROMPTLY TO EVOLVING TRENDS

IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AND NEEDS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE STORES AND TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES, EXPECTATIONS AS TO SERVICE LEVELS, SPENDING PATTERNS AND

HOME IMPROVEMENT NEEDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES WHILE

ALSO CONTROLLING OUR LABOR COSTS.

OUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE FROM OUR ASSOCIATES. TO

BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST ATTRACT, TRAIN AND RETAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CONTROLLING LABOR COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO

NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE RATES, THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OR LABOR RELATIONS, SUCH AS THE PROPOSED EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT, AND HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS. IN ADDITION,

WE COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAIL BUSINESSES FOR MANY OF OUR ASSOCIATES IN HOURLY POSITIONS, AND WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN TRAINING AND MOTIVATING THEM. THESE POSITIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD HIGH TURNOVER RATES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED

TRAINING AND RETENTION COSTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, OUR CENTRALIZATION OF CERTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES FUNCTIONS MIGHT NOT BE READILY ADAPTED BY OUR

ASSOCIATES AND THEREFORE MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS.

THE INFLATION OR DEFLATION OF COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT OUR

PRICES, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LUMBER AND OTHER

RAW MATERIALS, ARE HISTORICALLY VOLATILE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, LABOR COSTS, COMPETITION, MARKET SPECULATION, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PERIODIC DELAYS IN DELIVERY.

RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR SALES AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

WE RELY ON

THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS, OR IF OUR CURRENT SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS PRODUCTS THAT MEET

OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE BUY OUR PRODUCTS FROM SUPPLIERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR

ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO CAN SATISFY OUR HIGH STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND OUR NEED TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS

PRODUCTS ALSO CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS (PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS), SUPPLIERS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COST AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND OUR

ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS OF BRAND NAME PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, WE HAVE FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SUPPLIERS TO MARKET PRODUCTS UNDER A VARIETY OF WELL-RECOGNIZED BRAND NAMES.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE AND EXPAND THESE ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS OR IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS

AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

ANY SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISE OR BREACH OF CUSTOMER, ASSOCIATE OR COMPANY DATA SECURITY COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY IS INCREASINGLY RIGOROUS, WITH NEW AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SECURED DATA ARE ADEQUATE TO SAFEGUARD

AGAINST ALL DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM OR PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO ANALYZE, PROCESS

AND MANAGE TRANSACTIONS AND DATA. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DATA IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS. WE OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD EXPERIENCE ERRORS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS OR CESSATIONS OF SERVICE IN KEY PORTIONS OF OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND BE EXPENSIVE, TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE TO REMEDY.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, AND THESE INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MIGHT FAIL.

WE HAVE MADE, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE OUR

OPERATIONS TO ALLOW OUR ASSOCIATES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COST AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND INTERRUPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING

THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD DISRUPT OR REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ADDITION, OUR IMPROVED SUPPLY CHAIN AND NEW OR UPGRADED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN

EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, OR THE INITIATIVES MIGHT FAIL ALTOGETHER.

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS COULD INCREASE AS A

RESULT OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS.

CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR LIVING WAGE

REQUIREMENTS OR CHANGES IN OTHER WAGE OR WORKPLACE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SALE OF SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS OR TAX REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. PASSAGE OF THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OR OTHER SIMILAR LAWS IN CONGRESS COULD LEAD TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS BY ENCOURAGING UNIONIZATION EFFORTS AMONG OUR ASSOCIATES AND DISRUPTION OF STORE OPERATIONS. HEALTHCARE REFORM, IF

ENACTED, COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS AND OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE TERMS UNDER OUR BENEFIT PLANS FOR OUR ASSOCIATES.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF NEEDED, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

WE OBTAIN AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY FROM THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY A BACK-UP

CREDIT FACILITY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS. ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A STRONG INVESTMENT GRADE RATING AND HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2009, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL

FINANCING THROUGH THE CAPITAL MARKETS, IF NEEDED, WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN

DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, HIGHER COST OF BORROWING AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE EQUITY MARKET, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME OPERATIONAL RISKS WE FACE IN OUR

U.S. OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS UNIQUE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ANY EXPANSION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY OUR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND GAIN

ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS BY LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS, U.S. LAWS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

CURRENCY REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FCPA AND LOCAL ANTI-BRIBERY LAW COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE EFFECTIVELY OUR INSTALLATION SERVICE BUSINESS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES

AND LAWSUITS.

WE ACT AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR D-I-F-M CUSTOMERS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS.

AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS APPLICABLE TO GENERAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSING, PERMITTING AND QUALITY OF OUR THIRD-PARTY INSTALLERS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE

PROTECTIONS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY LAW TO MANAGE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE THESE PROCESSES EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD SUFFER LOST SALES, FINES AND LAWSUITS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT RELATED TO COMPLEX ACCOUNTING MATTERS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND RELATED ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH REGARD TO A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION, ASSET IMPAIRMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVENTORIES,

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, SELF-INSURANCE, TAX MATTERS AND LITIGATION, ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INVOLVE MANY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THESE RULES OR THEIR INTERPRETATION OR CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR

JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR REPORTED OR EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES WITH CERTAINTY, SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION THAT

ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND THE OUTCOME OF SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTIONS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR COULD RESULT IN EXCESSIVE VERDICTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEFENDING AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER MATTERS.
