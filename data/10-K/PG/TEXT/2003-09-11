BUSINESS.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN

BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE.

TODAY, THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS

IN MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE TERM THE COMPANY AS USED

HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

IN MARCH, 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A

CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA AG FROM THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS AND, IN JUNE,

2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A TENDER OFFER FOR THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING VOTING

CLASS SHARES AND PREFERENCE SHARES. ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2003, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PURCHASE OF THE SHARES OF WELLA AG HELD BY

THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS FOR 3.16 BILLION EUROS (APPROXIMATELY

$3.42 BILLION

BASED ON SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ON THAT DATE). ON SEPTEMBER 10,

2003, THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE SHARES SECURED THROUGH THE TENDER OFFER FOR

1.49 BILLION EUROS (APPROXIMATELY $1.67 BILLION BASED ON SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ON

THAT DATE). AS A RESULT OF THESE PURCHASES, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE OUTSTANDING WELLA SHARES (99% OF THE VOTING

CLASS SHARES AND 45% OF THE PREFERENCE SHARES). THE ACQUISITION WAS FINANCED

BY A MIXTURE OF AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND DEBT. WELLA AG IS A LEADING BEAUTY CARE COMPANY SELLING ITS

PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES, FOCUSED ON PROFESSIONAL HAIR CARE, RETAIL

HAIR CARE AND COSMETICS AND FRAGRANCES.

ON

NOVEMBER 16, 2001, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE CLAIROL

BUSINESS FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY AND, ON MAY 31, 2002, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF THE JIF PEANUT BUTTER AND CRISCO SHORTENING BRANDS TO

THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT MERGER INTO THE J.M. SMUCKER

COMPANY.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO TRANSITION FROM ITS

PREVIOUS GEOGRAPHIC-BASED STRUCTURE TO A PRODUCT-BASED GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT

STRUCTURE. CONCURRENT WITH THAT CHANGE, THE COMPANY INITIATED A MULTI-YEAR

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, A DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 2, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 42-43 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TRANSACTIONS IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 3, ACQUISITIONS AND SPIN-OFF, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 43-44 OF

THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003,

EXCLUDING THE FIRST PARAGRAPH THEREOF, WHICH IS UPDATED BY THE INFORMATION ON

WELLA ABOVE.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: FABRIC AND HOME

CARE; BABY AND FAMILY CARE; BEAUTY CARE; HEALTH CARE; AND SNACKS AND BEVERAGES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 53-54, AND

FINANCIAL REVIEW, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 23-33 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, REPRESENTED BY THE AGGREGATE OF ITS FABRIC AND

HOME CARE; BABY AND FAMILY CARE; BEAUTY CARE; HEALTH CARE; AND SNACKS AND

BEVERAGES SEGMENTS, IS ESSENTIALLY HOMOGENEOUS. NONE OF THESE SEGMENTS ARE

SEASONAL. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FIVE

SEGMENTS ARE SIMILAR. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES RELATE TO THE DEGREE OF CAPITAL

INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES, WHICH MAY AFFECT GROSS MARGIN TRENDS AND OPERATING

MARGINS. THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THE PRODUCTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETE WITH

PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, AND THERE IS NO DOMINANT COMPETITOR

OR COMPETITORS. ADVERTISING IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES

FORCE, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST

EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT QUALITY,

PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS. MOST

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF ITS SEGMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH FOOD,

DRUG, MASS AND OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS.

THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 19% OF CONSOLIDATED FISCAL

2003 SALES, COMPARED TO 19% IN 2002 AND 20% IN 2001. THE DIAPER CATEGORY

CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 12% OF CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR EACH OF THE PAST THREE

FISCAL YEARS. THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS ON THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VITAL

INGREDIENTS IN THE COMPANYS CONTINUING PROGRESS IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

MARKETS IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS. BASIC RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.

WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE

YEARS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO

FUTURE GROWTH.

THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED TRADEMARKS AND OWNS OR HAS LICENSES UNDER

PATENTS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS BUSINESS IN ALL SEGMENTS. SOME

OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND

PROCESSING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN

EACH SEGMENT ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, THE COMPANYS SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED

TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND

LICENSES.

MOST OF THE RAW MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS,

SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME RAW MATERIALS,

PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, ARE PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY FOR FURTHER USE IN THE

MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE COMPANY PURCHASES AND PRODUCES A SUBSTANTIAL

VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR 2003 FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

SUCH EXPENDITURES IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND NO MATERIAL DECREASE IS EXPECTED IN

FISCAL YEAR 2004.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE

SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES AND

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 98,000 EMPLOYEES. THE DECLINE OF

APPROXIMATELY 4,000 EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY FROM

SEPARATIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY OWNS AND OPERATES 35 MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES AND LEASES AND OPERATES 2 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THESE

FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN 21 DIFFERENT STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OWNS

AND OPERATES 83 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 42 OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY

OF THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR

MULTIPLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FABRIC AND

HOME CARE PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AT 45 OF THESE LOCATIONS; BABY AND FAMILY CARE

PRODUCTS AT 32; HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 25; BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS AT 39; AND

SNACKS AND BEVERAGES PRODUCTS AT 11. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY AND THAT

THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AT OFF-SITE SUPERFUND

LOCATIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF INVESTIGATION. THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED AT THE END OF JUNE 30, 2003, REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS PROBABLE

FUTURE COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, WAS $5 MILLION.

INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 53-54 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THE ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND IN OTHER

CONTEXTS RELATING TO VOLUME AND NET SALES GROWTH, INCREASES IN MARKET SHARES,

FINANCIAL GOALS AND COST REDUCTION, AMONG OTHERS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES

REGARDING COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, PRICING, PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER TRENDS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, CURRENCY

MOVEMENTS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN MARKETS AVAILABLE

AT THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. AMONG THE KEY FACTORS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE

THE COMPANYS GOALS ARE: (1) THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS PLANS, INCLUDING

GROWING EXISTING SALES AND VOLUME PROFITABLY AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING AND

INTEGRATING KEY ACQUISITIONS (INCLUDING WELLA) AND COMPLETING PLANNED

DIVESTITURES (INCLUDING A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANYS JUICE BUSINESS),

DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS (INCLUDING DEVELOPING MARKETS) ON

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS; (2) THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AND MAINTAIN

KEY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS; (3) THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN KEY MANUFACTURING AND

SUPPLY SOURCES (INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND PLANT MANUFACTURING SOURCES); (4)

THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING

PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS), AND TO RESOLVE PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT

ESTIMATES; (5) THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT, ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN COST

IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN MANUFACTURING AND OVERHEAD AREAS, INCLUDING SUCCESSFUL

COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS OUTSOURCING PROJECTS; (6) THE ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CURRENCY (INCLUDING CURRENCY ISSUES IN VOLATILE COUNTRIES),

INTEREST RATE AND CERTAIN COMMODITY COST EXPOSURES; (7) THE ABILITY TO MANAGE

THE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL AND/OR

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY DUE TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES; AND (8) THE ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF RAW MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IF THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE INCORRECT OR

DO NOT COME TO FRUITION, OR IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF THESE KEY

FACTORS, THEN THE COMPANYS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE HEREIN.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

THE

COMPANYS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE, A.G.

LAFLEY, AND THE COMPANYS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CLAYTON C. DALEY, JR., HAVE

EVALUATED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS SYSTEMS AS OF

THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.

MESSRS. LAFLEY AND DALEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY CAN MEET ITS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

SYSTEM IS BASED UPON A GLOBAL CHAIN OF FINANCIAL, STAFF AND GENERAL BUSINESS

REPORTING LINES THAT CONVERGE IN THE WORLD-WIDE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMPANY IN

CINCINNATI, OHIO. THE REPORTING PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION

REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN THE REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS

WITH THE COMMISSION IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE

TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE COMMISSIONS RULES AND FORMS. CONSISTENT WITH SEC

SUGGESTION, THE COMPANY HAS FORMED A DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF KEY

COMPANY PERSONNEL DESIGNED TO REVIEW THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF ALL

DISCLOSURES MADE BY THE COMPANY.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE EVALUATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, NO CHANGES IN THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OCCURRED DURING

THE COMPANY'S FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR

IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
