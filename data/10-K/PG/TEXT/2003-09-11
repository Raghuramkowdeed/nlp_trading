item1. business.
general development of business
the procter & gamble company was incorporated in ohio in 1905, having been
built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter and james gamble.
today, the company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products
in many countries throughout the world.
unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the company as used
herein refers to the procter & gamble company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.
in march, 2003, the company entered into an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in wella ag from the majority shareholders and, in june,
2003, the company completed a tender offer for the remaining outstanding voting
class shares and preference shares. on september2, 2003, the company
completed the previously announced purchase of the shares of wella ag held by
the majority shareholders for 3.16billion euros (approximately
$3.42billion
based on spot exchange rates on that date). on september10,
2003, the company purchased the shares secured through the tender offer for
1.49billion euros (approximately $1.67 billion based on spot exchange rates on
that date). as a result of these purchases, the company
acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding wella shares (99% of the voting
class shares and 45% of the preference shares). the acquisition was financed
by a mixture of available cash balances and debt. wella ag is a leading beauty care company selling its
products in more than 150 countries, focused on professional hair care, retail
hair care and cosmetics and fragrances.
on
november16, 2001, the company completed the acquisition of the clairol
business from bristol-myers squibb company and, on may31, 2002, the company
completed the spin-off of the jif peanut butter and crisco shortening brands to
the companys shareholders and their subsequent merger into the j.m. smucker
company.
in 1999, the company announced its intention to transition from its
previous geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit
structure. concurrent with that change, the company initiated a multi-year
restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein by
reference to note 2, restructuring program, which appears on pages 42-43 of the
annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003.
additional information about these transactions is incorporated herein by
reference to note 3, acquisitions and spin-off, which appears on pages 43-44 of
the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003,
excluding the first paragraph thereof, which is updated by the information on
wella above.
financial information about industry segments
the companys products fall into five business segments: fabric and home
care; baby and family care; beauty care; health care; and snacks and beverages.
additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to note 12, segment information, which appears on pages 53-54, and
financial review, which appears on pages 23-33 of the annual report to
shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003.
table of contents
narrative description of business
the companys business, represented by the aggregate of its fabric and
home care; baby and family care; beauty care; health care; and snacks and
beverages segments, is essentially homogeneous. none of these segments are
seasonal. many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these five
segments are similar. the primary differences relate to the degree of capital
intensity of the businesses, which may affect gross margin trends and operating
margins. the markets in which the companys products are sold are highly
competitive. the products of the companys business segments compete with
products of many large and small companies, and there is no dominant competitor
or competitors. advertising is used in conjunction with an extensive sales
force, because the company believes this combination provides the most
efficient method of marketing for these types of products. product quality,
performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors. most
of the companys products in each of its segments are distributed through food,
drug, mass and other retail outlets.
the laundry category constituted approximately 19% of consolidated fiscal
2003 sales, compared to 19% in 2002 and 20% in 2001. the diaper category
constituted approximately 12% of consolidated sales for each of the past three
fiscal years. the creation of new products and the development of new
performance benefits for consumers on the companys existing products are vital
ingredients in the companys continuing progress in the highly competitive
markets in which it does business. basic research and product development
activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future
years, the company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to
future growth.
the company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. some
of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the companys products. the trademarks of all major products in
each segment are registered. in part, the companys success can be attributed
to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and
licenses.
most of the raw materials used by the company are purchased from others,
some of whom are single-source suppliers. additionally, some raw materials,
primarily chemicals, are produced by the company for further use in the
manufacturing process. the company purchases and produces a substantial
variety of raw materials, no one of which is material to the companys business
taken as a whole.
expenditures in fiscal year 2003 for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different from
such expenditures in the prior year, and no material decrease is expected in
fiscal year 2004.
operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and economic growth.
table of contents
the company has approximately 98,000 employees. the decline of
approximately 4,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily from
separations related to the companys restructuring program.

item2. properties.

facilities and leases and operates 2 manufacturing facilities. these
facilities are located in 21 different states. in addition, the company owns
and operates 83 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. many
of the domestic and international facilities produce products for
multiple business segments. fabric and
home care products are produced at 45 of these locations; baby and family care
products at 32; health care products at 25; beauty care products at 39; and
snacks and beverages products at 11. management believes that the companys
production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that
the properties and equipment have been well maintained.
item3. legal proceedings.
the company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. the

commitments and contingencies, which appears on page 53; and note 12, segment
information, which appears on pages 53-54 of the annual report to shareholders
for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003.
the company has made certain forward-looking statements in the annual
report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003 and in other
contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market shares,
financial goals and cost reduction, among others.
these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates
regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic
conditions, customer and consumer trends, technological innovation, currency
movements, governmental action and the development of certain markets available
at the time the statements are made. among the key factors necessary to achieve
the companys goals are: (1)the ability to achieve business plans, including
growing existing sales and volume profitably and successfully managing and
integrating key acquisitions (including wella) and completing planned
divestitures (including a potential sale of the companys juice business),
despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the
product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) on
which the company has chosen to focus; (2)the ability to manage and maintain
key customer relationships; (3)the ability to maintain key manufacturing and
supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (4)
the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including
product liability matters), and to resolve pending matters within current
estimates; (5)the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost
improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including successful
completion of the companys outsourcing projects; (6)the ability to
successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries),
interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; (7)the ability to manage
the continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in the
companys significant geographical markets, as well as any political and/or
economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities; and (8)the ability to
successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the
companys products. if the companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or
do not come to fruition, or if the company does not achieve all of these key
factors, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from the
forward-looking statements made herein.

the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
financial review, which appears on pages 23-33, and note 7, risk management
activities, which appears on pages 46-47 of the annual report to shareholders
for the fiscal year ended june30, 2003.
item8. financial statements and supplemental data.
the financial statements and supplemental data are incorporated by
reference to pages 34-55 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal
year ended june30, 2003.
item9. disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure.
not applicable.
item9a. controls and procedures.
the
companys chairman of the board, president and chief executive, a.g.
lafley, and the companys chief financial officer, clayton c. daley, jr., have
evaluated the companys internal controls and disclosure controls systems as of
the end of the period covered by this report.
messrs.lafley and daley have concluded that the companys disclosure controls
systems are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the
company can meet its disclosure obligations. the companys disclosure controls
system is based upon a global chain of financial, staff and general business
reporting lines that converge in the world-wide headquarters of the company in
cincinnati, ohio. the reporting process is designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits
with the commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms. consistent with sec
suggestion, the company has formed a disclosure committee consisting of key
company personnel designed to review the accuracy and completeness of all
disclosures made by the company.
in
connection with the evaluation described above, no changes in the
company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during
the company's fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal
control over financial reporting.
