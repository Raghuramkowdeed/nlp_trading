COMPANY, P&G, WE, OUR OR US AS USED HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE

REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER GOODS PRODUCTS OF

SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE WORLDS CONSUMERS. THE COMPANY WAS

INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER

AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS

ON FORM 8-K ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC. THE SEC MAINTAINS AN INTERNET SITE THAT

CONTAINS THESE REPORTS AT.

HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV

. YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS THESE REPORTS THROUGH LINKS

FROM OUR WEBSITE AT: WWW.PG.COM/INVESTORS/SECTIONMAIN.SHTML.

COPIES OF THESE REPORTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE, WITHOUT CHARGE, BY CONTACTING THE PROCTER & GAMBLE

COMPANY, SHAREHOLDER SERVICES DEPARTMENT, P.O. BOX 5572, CINCINNATI, OHIO 45201-5572.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

IN FISCAL YEAR 2008, THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED INTO THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS: BEAUTY;

HEALTH & WELL-BEING; AND HOUSEHOLD CARE. WE HAD SIX REPORTABLE SEGMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP: BEAUTY;

GROOMING; HEALTH CARE; SNACKS, COFFEE AND PET CARE; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE; AND BABY CARE AND

FAMILY CARE. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE SIMILAR.

OPERATING MARGINS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND

PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND DIFFERENCES

IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. NET SALES GROWTH BY

BUSINESS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS OF EACH

BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS. WHILE NONE OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE HIGHLY SEASONAL, COMPONENTS

WITHIN CERTAIN OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS BATTERIES (FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE),

APPLIANCES (GROOMING) AND PRESTIGE FINE FRAGRANCES (BEAUTY) ARE SEASONAL. IN ADDITION,

ANTICIPATION OR OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CAN DRIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH

DEMAND FOR BATTERIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS, PAGES 39-55, AND NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 74-75 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2008.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL

. OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF EXISTING

BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN OVER 180 COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG

STORES AND IN HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES WHICH SERVE MANY CONSUMERS IN

DEVELOPING MARKETS. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE PRESENCE OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN A CONSUMER IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE. WE

MUST ALSO WIN THE SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN A CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL

IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD VALUE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO

PROVIDE NEW, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BRANDING TO THE CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED

TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR. WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE

EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE OUR

COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES

. IN 2008, ONE PRODUCT CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 16% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL

YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

KEY CUSTOMERS

. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB

STORES, DRUG STORES AND HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES. SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006. NO OTHER CUSTOMER

REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 31% OF

OUR TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2008, COMPARED TO 30% OF TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2007 AND 31% IN 2006. THE

NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WE

BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS USED BY

THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. WE PRODUCE RAW

MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, FUEL,

NATURAL GAS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES USED IN OUR PLANTS, PRODUCTS AND IN

THE TRUCKS USED TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND OTHER

COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION. WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS

ON THE CHANGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND EXPECTED DURATION OF THE CHANGE.

THE COMPANY PURCHASES A SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF OTHER RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH

IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

. WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH

ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACTIVITY IN ALL BUSINESSES. SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES

COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS. THE

TRADEMARKS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE OVERALL MARKETING AND BRANDING OF OUR PRODUCTS.

ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS AND TRADEMARKS IN EACH BUSINESS ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, OUR SUCCESS CAN BE

ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITIVE CONDITION.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR

PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST SIMILAR PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN

GLOBAL COMPETITORS. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO

BUILD AWARENESS OF OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS

COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT

QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENDITURES ENABLE US TO

DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND OBTAIN PATENTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS AND

IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR CONSUMERS. TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $2,226 MILLION IN

2008, $2,112 MILLION IN 2007 AND $2,075 MILLION IN 2006.

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

. EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2009.

EMPLOYEES

. THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 138,000 EMPLOYEES.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 40% OF TOTAL NET SALES. NO OTHER

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY HAD NET SALES EXCEEDING 10% OF TOTAL NET SALES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES,

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND

DISRUPTIONS. OUR SALES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING

THE MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

GILLETTE ACQUISITION.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE EXCHANGE OF 0.975 SHARES

OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK, ON A TAX-FREE BASIS, FOR EACH SHARE OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY, WE ISSUED 962 MILLION SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK. WE ALSO ISSUED

79 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS. UNDER

THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $53.43 BILLION

INCLUDING COMMON STOCK, THE FAIR VALUE OF VESTED STOCK OPTIONS AND ACQUISITION COSTS.

THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY PROVIDED US WITH GLOBAL MARKET LEADERSHIP IN MALE

GROOMING, SELECTED FEMALE GROOMING PRODUCTS, ALKALINE BATTERIES AND IN MANUAL AND POWER

TOOTHBRUSHES. TOTAL SALES FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANY DURING ITS MOST RECENT PRE-ACQUISITION YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE $10.5 BILLION.

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTION, WE WERE REQUIRED TO DIVEST CERTAIN

OVERLAPPING BUSINESSES. WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SPINBRUSH TOOTHBRUSH BUSINESS,

REMBRANDT (A GILLETTE ORAL CARE PRODUCT LINE) AND RIGHT GUARD AND OTHER GILLETTE DEODORANT BRANDS

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006.

JUICE DIVESTITURE.

IN AUGUST 2004 THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF ITS JUICE BUSINESS.

WELLA ACQUISITION

. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA.

THROUGH A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA AND A TENDER OFFER MADE

ON THE REMAINING SHARES, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE OUTSTANDING WELLA SHARES (99% OF THE

VOTING CLASS SHARES AND 45% OF THE PREFERENCE SHARES). IN JUNE 2004, A COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY AND

WELLA ENTERED INTO A DOMINATION AND PROFIT TRANSFER AGREEMENT (THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT). UNDER

THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE FULL OPERATING CONTROL AND RECEIVE 100% OF

THE FUTURE EARNINGS OF WELLA. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO PAY THE

REMAINING SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA A GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, THE REMAINING

WELLA SHAREHOLDERS COULD HAVE ELECTED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES TO THE COMPANY FOR AN AGREED PRICE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TOTAL GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WAS $1.11 BILLION, WHICH IS THE

APPROXIMATE COST IF ALL REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED. DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, A

PORTION OF THE REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED, RESULTING IN A $944 MILLION REDUCTION IN OUR

LIABILITY UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE WELLA SHAREHOLDER MEETING APPROVED

THE SQUEEZE-OUT OF THE REMAINING SHAREHOLDERS. UPON THE REGISTRATION OF THE SQUEEZE-OUT IN THE

COMMERCIAL REGISTER ON NOVEMBER 12, 2007, THE REMAINING SHARES OF THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS WERE

TRANSFERRED TO THE COMPANY IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRE-DETERMINED CASH CONSIDERATION. WHILE THE

DOMINATION AGREEMENT TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE GUARANTEED DIVIDEND PAYMENT AND THE CASH OFFER, AS

WELL AS

THE SQUEEZE-OUT TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE CASH CONSIDERATION, HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE

FORMER MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS, THE COMPANY NOW OWNS 100% OF THE WELLA STOCK.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR WELLA, INCLUDING ACQUISITION COSTS AND THE COSTS OF THE

GUARANTEED DIVIDEND AND SQUEEZE-OUT PAYMENTS, WAS $6.27 BILLION BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES AT THE

ACQUISITION DATES. THE ACQUISITION WAS FINANCED BY A MIXTURE OF AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES, DEBT AND

THE LIABILITY RECORDED UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

HUTCHISON ACQUISITION

. IN JUNE 2004, WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 20% STAKE OF OUR CHINA VENTURE

FROM OUR PARTNER, HUTCHISON WHAMPOA CHINA LTD. (HUTCHISON), GIVING US FULL OWNERSHIP OF OUR

OPERATIONS IN CHINA. THE NET PURCHASE PRICE WAS $1.85 BILLION, WHICH IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF

$2.00 BILLION NET OF MINORITY INTEREST AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF

THE TRANSACTION. THE ACQUISITION WAS FUNDED BY DEBT.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

WE DISCUSS OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS FORM 10-K, THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY

REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. ALL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR

HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ARE BASED ON

FINANCIAL DATA AND BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY

BECOME OUT OF DATE OR INCOMPLETE. WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHER FACTORS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR

EXPECTATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) AND

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE

BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD

CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL

TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND

PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS.

THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES,

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT TO

ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY SHIFTING OUR PORTFOLIO TOWARDS FASTER GROWING, HIGHER

MARGIN BUSINESSES. IF DEMAND AND GROWTH RATES FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OR OUR

MARKET SHARE DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE BUSINESSES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THIS COULD OCCUR DUE TO UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OR TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER

TRENDS AND HABITS. IN ADDITION, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION,

WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT

LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL

AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE

ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS

THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS

GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS GILLETTE, COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS

RESULTS.

SINCE OUR GOALS INCLUDE A GROWTH COMPONENT TIED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION TO OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND EXECUTE BUSINESS PLANS ON OUR BASE BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE

EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW

MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. OUR COSTS IN 2008 WERE IMPACTED BY

HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 2009. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS,

COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND CERTAIN HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY KEY SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING PLANT

ARRANGEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY ACHIEVING DISPROPORTIONATE

GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS. SHOULD GROWTH RATES OR OUR MARKET SHARE FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW

EXPECTED LEVELS IN THESE REGIONS, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC

CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INFLATION,

DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY

TO MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT

GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO TERRORIST AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED

LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAXATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS), AND TO RESOLVE PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

LIABILITY, INCLUDING THE COMPETITION LAW AND ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3

OF THIS FORM

10-K, WHICH COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT RESERVES OR PAY SIGNIFICANT FINES

DURING A REPORTING PERIOD, MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

IF THE REPUTATION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS ERODES SIGNIFICANTLY, IT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COMPANYS FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRANDS,

PARTICULARLY OUR BILLION-DOLLAR BRANDS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE BRANDS CAN SUFFER IF OUR MARKETING

PLANS OR PRODUCT INITIATIVES DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON A BRANDS IMAGE OR ITS ABILITY TO

ATTRACT CONSUMERS. FURTHER, OUR COMPANYS RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF ONE OF OUR

LEADING BRANDS SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ITS REPUTATION DUE TO REAL OR PERCEIVED QUALITY

ISSUES.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RETAIL

TRADE CUSTOMERS. THIS INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRADE TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS AND ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS. OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF

WE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT WITH A KEY CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR TRADE TERMS AND PRINCIPLES. FURTHER,

THERE IS A CONTINUING TREND TOWARDS RETAIL TRADE CONSOLIDATION AND THIS LEADS TO MORE COMPLEX WORK

ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES FOR BOTH US AND KEY RETAILERS. THIS CAN BE PARTICULARLY

DIFFICULT WHEN MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE ADDRESSING LOCAL TRADE PRESSURES OR LOCAL LAW AND REGULATION

CHANGES. FURTHER, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF A KEY CUSTOMER WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCE THE RANGE OR INVENTORY LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCTS.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

NONE.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OWN AND OPERATE 39 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN 23 DIFFERENT

STATES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN AND OPERATE 103 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 42 OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY

OF THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESSES. BEAUTY

PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AT 42 OF THESE LOCATIONS; GROOMING PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AT 13 OF

THESE LOCATIONS; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS AT 49; BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE PRODUCTS AT

29; PET CARE, SNACKS AND COFFEE PRODUCTS AT 15; AND HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 37. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY

AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT

OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS, INCLUDING ANTITRUST AND TRADE REGULATION,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, ADVERTISING, CONTRACTS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, PATENT AND TRADEMARK MATTERS, AND

TAXES.

RECENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS BECOME SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO POTENTIAL

COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN JULY 2006, FRENCH AUTHORITIES, IN CONNECTION

WITH AN INQUIRY INTO POTENTIAL COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN FRANCE, ENTERED THE PREMISES OF TWO OF

THE COMPANYS FRENCH SUBSIDIARIES AND SEIZED A VARIETY OF DOCUMENTS. IN APRIL 2008, UK AUTHORITIES

INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION CONCERNING POTENTIAL ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS IN THE UK INVOLVING ONE OF THE

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES. IN JUNE 2008, EUROPEAN COMMISSION OFFICIALS, WITH THE

ASSISTANCE OF THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES FROM A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES, STARTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO

POTENTIAL COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. AT THE

SAME TIME, THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IN SPAIN AND ITALY INITIATED ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO

POTENTIAL ANTITRUST CONCERNS WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS, A

NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES WERE VISITED AND DOCUMENTS SEIZED. THE COMPANY OR ITS

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW INVESTIGATIONS IN BELGIUM, ROMANIA AND

GREECE. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE MATTERS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

COMPANIES AND/OR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ALL ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION LAWS.

COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST LAW INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND, IF

VIOLATIONS ARE FOUND, CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES. AT THIS POINT, NO FORMAL CLAIMS HAVE BEEN

MADE AGAINST THE COMPANY OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF ABOVE INQUIRIES.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR JUST ENDED, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES IN GERMANY RECEIVED A

FORMAL COMPLAINT ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS. WE ARE NOW DISCUSSING THE SITUATION

WITH THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES.

GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, 1997. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR

APPROVAL, IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS

BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN,

GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH

OF DEPARTURE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE

SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE

GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE

COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS

AND TO STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS

THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO

SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE

GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS,

RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. THESE

OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT.

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN

DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING BOARD APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE

COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES.

FROM THE DATE OF THIS FIRST GRANT THROUGH JUNE 30, 2003, EACH NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FOLLOWING THE GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30, 2003, THE COMPANY

SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN AND INTENDS TO MAKE NO FURTHER GRANTS UNDER THIS PART OF THE PLAN.

THE PLAN TERMINATED ON OCTOBER 13, 2007.

IN ADDITION TO THE GRANTS ABOVE, ANNUAL GRANTS OF OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES ARE GRANTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 2001 STOCK AND

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS KEY MANAGERS

ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH GRANTS.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 1971 STOCK OPTION PLAN

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN AFTER APRIL 25, 2005, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK

OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THE PLAN WAS APPROVED BY

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER

& GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE ON

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS

TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.975 SHARES OF

P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY AND NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE

PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE COMPANY STOCK AT A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE WHICH

CANNOT BE LESS THAN 100% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE PER SHARE AT THE TIME THAT THE OPTION IS GRANTED.

THE PERIOD OF ANY OPTION MAY NOT EXCEED TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN WAS NOT TO

EXCEED 198 MILLION SHARES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DEATH OR DISCHARGE

FOR CAUSE, THE RECIPIENT IS PERMITTED TO EXERCISE ANY VESTED OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN FOR A PERIOD

BETWEEN THIRTY DAYS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER TERMINATION, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS/HER

DEPARTURE. IF A PARTICIPANT IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE, ALL OPTIONS ARE IMMEDIATELY CANCELLED. IF A

PARTICIPANT DIES WHILE HOLDING OPTIONS, THE OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE TO THREE

YEARS DEPENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN ALLOWS GILLETTE EMPLOYEES WHOSE

EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED FOR GOOD REASON WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS

TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.975 SHARES OF

P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK. ONLY EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY THE GILLETTE COMPANY

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY, AND

UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER BETWEEN THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND THE PROCTER & GAMBLE
