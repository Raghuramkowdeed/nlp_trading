TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN

BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE.

TODAY, THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS

IN MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE TERM THE COMPANY AS USED

HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO TRANSITION FROM ITS

PREVIOUS GEOGRAPHIC-BASED STRUCTURE TO A PRODUCT-BASED GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT

STRUCTURE. CONCURRENT WITH THAT CHANGE, THE COMPANY INITIATED ITS ORGANIZATION

2005 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, A DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 2, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 27-28 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO THE LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 1-3 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: FABRIC AND HOME

CARE, PAPER, BEAUTY CARE, HEALTH CARE, AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGE 34, AND FINANCIAL REVIEW, WHICH

APPEARS ON PAGES 10-19 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR

ENDED JUNE 30, 2001.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, REPRESENTED BY THE AGGREGATE OF ITS FABRIC AND

HOME CARE, PAPER, BEAUTY CARE, HEALTH CARE, AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE SEGMENTS, IS

ESSENTIALLY HOMOGENEOUS. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF

THESE FIVE SEGMENTS ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL. THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THE PRODUCTS OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETE WITH MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, AND

THERE IS NO DOMINANT COMPETITOR OR COMPETITORS. ADVERTISING IS USED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS

COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING THESE TYPES OF

PRODUCTS. PRODUCT QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

COMPETITIVE FACTORS. MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF ITS SEGMENTS

ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH FOOD, DRUG, MASS AND OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE LAUNDRY AND DIAPER CATEGORIES CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 20% AND 12% OF

CONSOLIDATED FISCAL 2001 SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE TO

THE YEAR BEFORE. THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS ON THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VITAL

INGREDIENTS IN ITS CONTINUING PROGRESS IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS IN

WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS. BASIC RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR. WHILE MANY OF

THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED TRADEMARKS AND OWNS OR HAS LICENSES UNDER

PATENTS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS BUSINESS IN ALL SEGMENTS. SOME

OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND

PROCESSING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN

EACH SEGMENT ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, THE COMPANYS SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED

TO THE EXISTENCE OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

MOST OF THE RAW MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME RAW MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, ARE PRODUCED BY THE

COMPANY FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE COMPANY PURCHASES

AND PRODUCES A SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH IS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR 2001 FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

SUCH EXPENDITURES IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND NO MATERIAL INCREASE IS EXPECTED IN

FISCAL YEAR 2002.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE

SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES AND

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 106,000 EMPLOYEES. THE DECLINE OF

APPROXIMATELY 4,000 EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGE 34; FINANCIAL

SUMMARY, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGE 35; AND FINANCIAL REVIEW, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES

10-19 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,

EAST AND AFRICA  27%; ASIA  10% AND LATIN AMERICA  8%.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY OWNS AND OPERATES 40 MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES AND LEASES AND OPERATES 2 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THESE

FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN 23 DIFFERENT STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OWNS

AND OPERATES 92 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 45 OTHER COUNTRIES. FABRIC AND

HOME CARE PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AT 47 OF THESE LOCATIONS; PAPER PRODUCTS AT 50;

HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 27; BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS AT 34; AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE

PRODUCTS AT 15. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES

ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND

EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AT OFF-SITE SUPERFUND LOCATIONS,

MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF INVESTIGATION. THE AMOUNT

ACCRUED AT THE END OF JUNE 30, 2001 REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS PROBABLE FUTURE

COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED WAS $6 MILLION.

ON JUNE 8, 2001, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE

TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT ALLEGING DAMAGES UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS RELATING TO

OUR MARCH 7, 2000 AND JUNE 8, 2000 EARNINGS RELEASES. IF APPROVED BY THE

COURT, THE COMPANY WILL PAY $49 MILLION IN CASH.

THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001; AND

THE COMPANYS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K DATED AUGUST 15, 2001.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND WILL MAKE CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN

THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 AND

IN OTHER CONTEXTS RELATING TO VOLUME GROWTH, INCREASES IN MARKET SHARES,

ORGANIZATION 2005, FINANCIAL GOALS AND COST REDUCTION, AMONG OTHERS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES

REGARDING COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, PRICING, PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, CURRENCY MOVEMENTS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTION

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN MARKETS. AMONG THE KEY FACTORS NECESSARY TO

ACHIEVE THE COMPANYS GOALS ARE: (1) THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF ORGANIZATION

2005 WITHIN THE COMPANYS PLANNED TIMING, INCLUDING ACHIEVEMENT OF EXPECTED

COST AND TAX SAVINGS AND SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND WORK

PROCESS RESTRUCTURING; (2) THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS PLANS, INCLUDING

VOLUME GROWTH AND PRICING PLANS, DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY,

ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS IN

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS; (3) THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN KEY CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS; (4) THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GROWTH IN SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPING MARKETS

SUCH AS CHINA, KOREA, MEXICO, THE SOUTHERN CONE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE

SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF THE CLAIROL BUSINESS; AND (10) THE ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND CERTAIN COMMODITY COST

EXPOSURES. IF THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE INCORRECT OR DO NOT

COME TO FRUITION, OR IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF THESE KEY FACTORS,

THEN THE COMPANYS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE HEREIN.
