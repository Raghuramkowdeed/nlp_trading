TERMS THE COMPANY, P&G, WE, OUR OR US AS USED HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE

COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER GOODS PRODUCTS OF

SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE WORLDS CONSUMERS. THE COMPANY WAS

INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER

AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS

ON FORM 8-K ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC. THE SEC MAINTAINS AN INTERNET SITE THAT

COMPANY, SHAREHOLDER SERVICES DEPARTMENT, P.O. BOX 5572, CINCINNATI, OHIO 45201-5572.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

IN FISCAL YEAR 2007, THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED INTO THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS: BEAUTY AND

HEALTH; HOUSEHOLD CARE; AND GILLETTE GBU. WE HAD SEVEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP.

BEAUTY; HEALTH CARE; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE; SNACKS, COFFEE AND PET CARE; BABY CARE AND FAMILY

CARE; BLADES AND RAZORS; AND DURACELL AND BRAUN. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN

UNDERSTANDING OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE SIMILAR. OPERATING MARGINS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES VARY

SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL

INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND DIFFERENCES IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A

PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. NET SALES GROWTH BY BUSINESS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE

UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS OF EACH BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS. NONE OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY

SEASONAL EXCEPT OUR DURACELL AND BRAUN BUSINESSES WHICH HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH LEVEL OF

SALES IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER DUE TO THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON. IN ADDITION, ANTICIPATION OR

OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CAN DRIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH DEMAND FOR BATTERIES.

WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO OUR ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE AND CERTAIN OF OUR KEY

LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN CHANGES TO OUR GBU AND SEGMENT STRUCTURE, EFFECTIVE FISCAL

YEAR 2008. SPECIFICALLY, OUR FISCAL 2008 STRUCTURE IS COMPRISED OF THREE GBUS WITH A TOTAL OF SIX

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE BUSINESSES THAT PREVIOUSLY COMPRISED THE GILLETTE GBU WILL NOW BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE

BEAUTY AND HOUSEHOLD CARE GBUS. AS A RESULT OF THESE MOVES, THE DURACELL AND BRAUN BUSINESSES WILL

NO LONGER COMPRISE A SEPARATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE BRAUN BUSINESS WILL BE MANAGED AND COMBINED

WITH THE BLADES AND RAZORS BUSINESS TO FORM THE GROOMING REPORTABLE SEGMENT WITHIN THE BEAUTY

GBU. THE GROOMING REPORTABLE SEGMENT WILL ALSO INCLUDE ALL SHAVE PREP PRODUCTS CURRENTLY BEING

REPORTED WITHIN THE BEAUTY REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE DURACELL BUSINESS WILL BE MOVED TO OUR

HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU AND WILL BE REPORTED AS PART OF OUR FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE REPORTABLE

SEGMENT. FINALLY, OUR FEMININE CARE BUSINESS, WHICH WAS PART OF OUR BEAUTY GBU AND REPORTABLE

SEGMENT, WILL NOW BE MOVED TO OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING GBU AND WILL BE MANAGED AND REPORTED AS

PART OF THE HEALTH CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

THESE CHANGES WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF JULY 1, 2007. THEY WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR SEGMENT

REPORTING BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2008, AT WHICH TIME OUR HISTORICAL SEGMENT REPORTING WILL ALSO

BE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE NEW STRUCTURE. THE GBU AND SEGMENT DISCUSSION IN THIS FORM 10-K

REFLECTS THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT EXISTED THROUGH JUNE 30, 2007.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS, PAGES 31-48, AND NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 67-68 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL

. OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF EXISTING

BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN OVER 180 COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES AND

DRUG STORES. WE HAVE ALSO EXPANDED OUR PRESENCE IN HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, THE NEIGHBORHOOD

STORES WHICH SERVE MANY CONSUMERS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR

CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE PRESENCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTH 

WHEN A CONSUMER IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE. WE MUST ALSO WIN THE SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN A

CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER IT WAS A

GOOD VALUE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BRANDING TO THE

CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO

ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.

WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, WE BELIEVE

THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES

. IN 2007, ONE PRODUCT CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 16% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL

YEARS 2007 AND 2006 AND 17% OF NET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2005. IN FISCAL YEAR 2005, WE HAD THREE

PRODUCT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, THAT ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE

OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE DIAPER CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 11% OF NET SALES IN

FISCAL YEAR 2005. THE RETAIL HAIR CARE CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF NET SALES IN

FISCAL YEAR 2005. FISCAL YEAR 2006 NET SALES PERCENTAGES FOR THE ABOVE CATEGORIES DECREASED DUE TO

THE ADDITION OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY ON OCTOBER 1, 2005.

KEY CUSTOMERS

. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB

STORES, DRUG STORES AND HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES. SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006 AND 16% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN

2005. NO OTHER CUSTOMER REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT

FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2007, COMPARED TO 31% IN 2006 AND 32% IN 2005. THE

NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WE

BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS USED BY

THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. WE PRODUCE RAW

MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, FUEL

AND NATURAL GAS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES USED IN OUR PLANTS AND IN THE TRUCKS USED TO DELIVER OUR

PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND OTHER COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATION. WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS ON THE CHANGE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS, DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND EXPECTED DURATION OF THE CHANGE. THE COMPANY PURCHASES A

SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS

TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

. WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH

ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACTIVITY IN ALL BUSINESSES. SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES

COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS. THE

TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN EACH BUSINESS ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, OUR SUCCESS CAN BE

ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

COMPETITIVE CONDITION.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR

PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST SIMILAR PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN

GLOBAL COMPETITORS. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO

BUILD AWARENESS OF OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS

COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT

QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ENABLE P&G TO

DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND OBTAIN PATENTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS AND

IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ITS CONSUMERS. TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $2,112 MILLION IN

2007, $2,075 MILLION IN 2006 AND $1,940 MILLION IN 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

. EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2008.

EMPLOYEES

. THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 138,000 EMPLOYEES. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR,

APPROXIMATELY 2,200 EMPLOYEE POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE GILLETTE

INTEGRATION. THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL POSITIONS ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF THE GILLETTE INTEGRATION TO

APPROXIMATELY 5,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF TOTAL NET SALES. NO OTHER

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY HAD NET SALES EXCEEDING 10% OF TOTAL NET SALES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES,

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND

DISRUPTIONS. OUR SALES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING

THE MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

GILLETTE ACQUISITION.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE EXCHANGE OF 0.975 SHARES

OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK, ON A TAX-FREE BASIS, FOR EACH SHARE OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY, WE ISSUED 962 MILLION SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK. THE VALUE OF

THESE SHARES WAS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE OF COMPANY STOCK PRICES BEGINNING TWO DAYS BEFORE AND

ENDING TWO DAYS AFTER JANUARY 28, 2005, THE DATE THE ACQUISITION WAS ANNOUNCED. WE ALSO ISSUED 79

MILLION STOCK OPTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS. UNDER THE

PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $53.43 BILLION INCLUDING

COMMON STOCK, THE FAIR VALUE OF VESTED STOCK OPTIONS AND ACQUISITION COSTS.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY PROVIDES US WITH GLOBAL MARKET LEADERSHIP IN MALE

GROOMING, SELECTED FEMALE GROOMING PRODUCTS, ALKALINE BATTERIES AND IN MANUAL AND POWER

TOOTHBRUSHES. TOTAL SALES FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANY DURING ITS MOST RECENT PRE-ACQUISITION YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE $10.5 BILLION.

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTION, WE WERE REQUIRED TO DIVEST CERTAIN

OVERLAPPING BUSINESSES. WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SPINBRUSH TOOTHBRUSH BUSINESS,

REMBRANDT (A GILLETTE ORAL CARE PRODUCT LINE) AND RIGHT GUARD AND OTHER GILLETTE DEODORANT BRANDS

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006.

JUICE DIVESTITURE.

IN AUGUST 2004 THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF ITS JUICE BUSINESS.

WELLA ACQUISITION

. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA.

THROUGH A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA AND A TENDER OFFER MADE

ON THE REMAINING SHARES, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE OUTSTANDING WELLA SHARES (99% OF THE

VOTING CLASS SHARES AND 45% OF THE PREFERENCE SHARES). IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY AND WELLA ENTERED

INTO A DOMINATION AND PROFIT TRANSFER AGREEMENT (THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT). UNDER THE DOMINATION

AGREEMENT, WE ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE FULL OPERATING CONTROL AND RECEIVE 100% OF THE FUTURE

EARNINGS OF WELLA. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE WILL PAY THE REMAINING

SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA A GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, THE REMAINING WELLA

SHAREHOLDERS MAY ELECT TO TENDER THEIR SHARES TO THE COMPANY FOR AN AGREED PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE TOTAL GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WAS $1.11 BILLION, WHICH IS THE APPROXIMATE COST

IF ALL REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED. DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, A PORTION OF THE

REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED, RESULTING IN A $944 MILLION REDUCTION IN OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE

DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR WELLA, INCLUDING ACQUISITION COSTS, WAS $6.27 BILLION BASED ON

EXCHANGE RATES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. THE ACQUISITION WAS FINANCED BY A MIXTURE OF AVAILABLE

CASH BALANCES, DEBT AND THE LIABILITY RECORDED UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

HUTCHISON ACQUISITION

. IN JUNE 2004, WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 20% STAKE OF OUR CHINA VENTURE

FROM OUR PARTNER, HUTCHISON WHAMPOA CHINA LTD. (HUTCHISON), GIVING US FULL OWNERSHIP OF OUR

OPERATIONS IN CHINA. THE NET PURCHASE PRICE WAS $1.85 BILLION, WHICH IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF

$2.00 BILLION NET OF MINORITY INTEREST AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF

THE TRANSACTION. THE ACQUISITION WAS FUNDED BY DEBT.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

WE DISCUSS OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS FORM 10-K, THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY

REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. ALL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR

HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ARE BASED ON

FINANCIAL DATA AND BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY

BECOME OUT OF DATE OR INCOMPLETE. WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHER FACTORS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR

EXPECTATIONS.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) AND

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE

BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD

CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL

TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND

PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS.

THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES,

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT TO

ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY SHIFTING OUR PORTFOLIO TOWARDS FASTER GROWING, HIGHER

MARGIN BUSINESSES. IF DEMAND AND GROWTH RATES FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OR OUR

MARKET SHARE DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE BUSINESSES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THIS COULD OCCUR DUE TO UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OR TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER

TRENDS AND HABITS. IN ADDITION, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION,

WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT

LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL

AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE

ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS

THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS

GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY GILLETTE, COULD IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS RESULTS.

SINCE OUR GOALS INCLUDE A GROWTH COMPONENT TIED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION TO OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND EXECUTE BUSINESS PLANS ON OUR BASE BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE

EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW

MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. OUR COSTS IN 2007 WERE IMPACTED BY

HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 2008. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS,

COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND

CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL

OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING

PLANT ARRANGEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY ACHIEVING DISPROPORTIONATE

GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS. SHOULD GROWTH RATES OR OUR MARKET SHARE FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW

EXPECTED LEVELS IN THESE REGIONS, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC

CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INFLATION,

DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT

GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO TERRORIST AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED

LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAXATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS AS WELL AS THOSE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF GILLETTE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

IF THE REPUTATION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS ERODES SIGNIFICANTLY, IT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR COMPANYS FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRANDS,

PARTICULARLY OUR BILLION-DOLLAR BRANDS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE BRANDS CAN SUFFER IF OUR MARKETING

PLANS OR PRODUCT INITIATIVES DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON A BRANDS IMAGE OR ITS ABILITY TO

ATTRACT CONSUMERS. FURTHER, OUR COMPANYS RESULTS COULD BE IMPACTED IF ONE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS

SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ITS REPUTATION DUE TO REAL OR PERCEIVED QUALITY ISSUES.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR

RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS. THIS INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRADE TERMS THAT ARE

ACCEPTABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS. OUR

BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT WITH A KEY CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR TRADE TERMS AND

PRINCIPLES. FURTHER, THERE IS A CONTINUING TREND TOWARDS RETAIL TRADE CONSOLIDATION AND THIS LEADS

TO MORE COMPLEX WORK ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES FOR BOTH US AND KEY RETAILERS. THIS CAN

BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WHEN MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE ADDRESSING LOCAL TRADE PRESSURES OR LOCAL LAW

AND REGULATION CHANGES. FURTHER, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF A KEY CUSTOMER WERE

TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RANGE OR INVENTORY LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCTS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT

OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS, INCLUDING ANTITRUST AND TRADE REGULATION,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, ADVERTISING, CONTRACTS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, PATENT AND TRADEMARK MATTERS, AND

TAXES. IN JULY 2006, FRENCH AUTHORITIES, IN CONNECTION WITH AN INQUIRY INTO POTENTIAL COMPETITION

LAW VIOLATIONS IN FRANCE, ENTERED THE PREMISES OF A NUMBER OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANIES OPERATING

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY

GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, 1997. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR

APPROVAL, IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS

SHAREHOLDERS ON OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN,

ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE: (I) GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II)

GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST

VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE

AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE

COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME

VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH OF

DEPARTURE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN MAY

BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE

ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE

SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE

GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE

COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS

AND TO STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS

THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO

SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE

GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS,

RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. THESE

OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT.

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN

DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING BOARD APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE

COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES.

FROM THE DATE OF THIS FIRST GRANT THROUGH JUNE 30, 2003, EACH NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FOLLOWING THE GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30,

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2003, THE COMPANY

SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN AND INTENDS TO MAKE NO FURTHER GRANTS UNDER THIS PART OF THE PLAN.

THE PLAN WILL TERMINATE ON OCTOBER 13, 2007.

IN ADDITION TO THE GRANTS ABOVE, ANNUAL GRANTS OF OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES ARE GRANTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 2001 STOCK AND

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS KEY MANAGERS

ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH GRANTS.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 1971 STOCK OPTION PLAN

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN AFTER APRIL 25, 2005, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK

OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THE PLAN WAS APPROVED BY

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER

& GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISEABLE

ON OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF .975

SHARES OF P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY AND NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS

RECEIVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE COMPANY STOCK AT A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE WHICH CANNOT BE LESS THAN

100% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE PER SHARE AT THE TIME THAT THE OPTION IS GRANTED. THE PERIOD OF ANY

OPTION MAY NOT EXCEED TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN WAS NOT TO EXCEED 198,000,000

SHARES.

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DEATH OR DISCHARGE

FOR CAUSE, THE RECIPIENT IS PERMITTED TO EXERCISE ANY VESTED OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE FOR A PERIOD

BETWEEN THIRTY DAYS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER TERMINATION, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS/HER

DEPARTURE. IF A PARTICIPANT IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE, ALL OPTIONS ARE IMMEDIATELY CANCELLED. IF A

PARTICIPANT DIES WHILE HOLDING OPTIONS, THE OPTIONS ARE EXERCISEABLE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE TO THREE

YEARS DEPENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN ALLOWS GILLETTE EMPLOYEES WHOSE

EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED FOR GOOD REASON WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER

THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE REMAINING OPTIONS FOR THE SHORTER OF FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THEIR TERMINATION

DATE OR THE ORIGINAL LIFE OF THE GRANT. EMPLOYEES TERMINATED FOR GOOD REASON WHO ARE ALSO

ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE UNDER A COMPANY PLAN ARE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS SUBJECT TO THE

ORIGINAL TERMS OF THE GRANT.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY APPROVED THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG TERM INCENTIVE

PLAN ON MAY 20, 2004, AND THE PLAN WAS ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER &

GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISEABLE ON

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS

TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF .975 SHARES OF

P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK. ONLY EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY THE GILLETTE COMPANY

PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1, 2005 ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS UNDER THIS PLAN.

PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 19,000,000 SHARES.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING

THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT: (1)
