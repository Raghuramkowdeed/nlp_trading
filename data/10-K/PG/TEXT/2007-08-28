additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
managements discussion and analysis, which appears on pages 31-48; note 1, summary of significant
accounting policies, which appears on pages 54-56; note 2, acquisitions, which appears on pages
56-57; and note 12, segment information, which appears on pages 67-68 of the annual report to
shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2007. unless the context indicates otherwise, the
terms the company, p&g, we, our or us as used herein refers to the procter & gamble
company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.
the procter & gamble company is focused on providing branded consumer goods products of
superior quality and value to improve the lives of the worlds consumers. the company was
incorporated in ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter
and james gamble. today, we market our products in more than 180 countries.
throughout this form 10-k, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed
with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
the companys annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports
on form 8-k are filed electronically with the sec. the sec maintains an internet site that
contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. you can also access these reports through links
from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.jhtml.
copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting the procter & gamble
company, shareholder services department, p.o. box 5572, cincinnati, ohio 45201-5572.
financial information about segments
in fiscal year 2007, the company was organized into three global business units: beauty and
health; household care; and gillette gbu. we had seven reportable segments under u.s. gaap:
beauty; health care; fabric care and home care; snacks, coffee and pet care; baby care and family
care; blades and razors; and duracell and braun. many of the factors necessary for an
understanding of these businesses are similar. operating margins of the individual businesses vary
slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital
intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales. net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the
underlying growth of the markets of each business and products. none of our businesses are highly
seasonal except our duracell and braun businesses which have a disproportionately high level of
sales in the december quarter due to the december holiday season. in addition, anticipation or
occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries.
we recently announced a number of changes to our organization structure and certain of our key
leadership positions, which resulted in changes to our gbu and segment structure, effective fiscal
year 2008. specifically, our fiscal 2008 structure is comprised of three gbus with a total of six
reportable segments:
table of contents
global business units
reportable segments
beauty
beauty
grooming
health and well being
health care
snacks, coffee and pet care
household care
fabric care and home care
baby care and family care
the businesses that previously comprised the gillette gbu will now be included within the
beauty and household care gbus. as a result of these moves, the duracell and braun businesses will
no longer comprise a separate reportable segment. the braun business will be managed and combined
with the blades and razors business to form the grooming reportable segment within the beauty
gbu. the grooming reportable segment will also include all shave prep products currently being
reported within the beauty reportable segment. the duracell business will be moved to our
household care gbu and will be reported as part of our fabric care and home care reportable
segment. finally, our feminine care business, which was part of our beauty gbu and reportable
segment, will now be moved to our health and well being gbu and will be managed and reported as
part of the health care reportable segment.
these changes were effective as of july1, 2007. they will be reflected in our segment
reporting beginning in fiscal year 2008, at which time our historical segment reporting will also
be restated to reflect the new structure. the gbu and segment discussion in this form 10-k
reflects the organizational structure that existed through june30, 2007.
additional information about our businesses can be found in managements discussion and
analysis, pages 31-48, and note 12, segment information, which appears on pages 67-68 of the annual
report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2007.
narrative description of business
business model. our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing
brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. the markets and industry segments in
which we offer our products are highly competitive. our products are sold in over 180 countries
around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and
drug stores. we have also expanded our presence in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood
stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. we work collaboratively with our
customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the first moment of truth
when a consumer is shopping in the store. we must also win the second moment of truth  when a
consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a
good value. we believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the
consumer in order to grow our business. research and product development activities, designed to
enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe
these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth.
table of contents
key product categories. in 2007, one product category accounted for 10% or more of
consolidated net sales. the laundry category constituted approximately 16% of net sales for fiscal
years 2007 and 2006 and 17% of net sales in fiscal year 2005. in fiscal year 2005, we had three
product categories, including the laundry category described above, that accounted for 10% or more
of consolidated net sales. the diaper category represented approximately 11% of net sales in
fiscal year 2005. the retail hair care category accounted for approximately 10% of net sales in
fiscal year 2005. fiscal year 2006 net sales percentages for the above categories decreased due to
the addition of the gillette company on october1, 2005.
key customers. our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club
stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. sales to wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates
represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in both 2007 and 2006 and 16% of total revenue in
2005. no other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. our top ten customers account
for approximately 30% of total unit volume in 2007, compared to 31% in 2006 and 32% in 2005. the
nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. we
believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent
with the industry segments in which we compete.
sources and availability of materials. almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by
the company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. we produce raw
materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. in addition, fuel
and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks used to deliver our
products to customers. the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to
fluctuation. when prices for these items change, we may or may not pass on the change to our
customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. the company purchases a
substantial variety of raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material to our business
taken as a whole.
trademarks and patents. we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which
are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. some of these patents or licenses
cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. the
trademarks of all major products in each business are registered. in part, our success can be
attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.
competitive condition. the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. our
products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known
global competitors. we market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to
build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. we believe this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. product
quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.
research and development expenditures. research and development expenditures enable p&g to
develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and
improve the lives of its consumers. total research and development expenses were $2,112million in
2007, $2,075million in 2006 and $1,940million in 2005.
table of contents
expenditures for environmental compliance. expenditures for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not
material to the company. no material change is expected in fiscal year 2008.
employees. the company has approximately 138,000 employees. during the fiscal year,
approximately 2,200 employee positions were eliminated from the company as a result of the gillette
integration. this brings the total positions eliminated as a result of the gillette integration to
approximately 5,000.
financial information about foreign and domestic operations
net sales in the united states account for approximately 42% of total net sales. no other
individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. operations outside the united
states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the
business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values,
different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and
disruptions. our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june30 were as follows:

development of the business
the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including
the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over the past five years.
gillette acquisition. on october1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of the gillette
company. pursuant to the acquisition agreement, which provided for the exchange of 0.975 shares
of the procter & gamble company common stock, on a tax-free basis, for each share of the gillette
company, we issued 962million shares of the procter & gamble company common stock. the value of
these shares was determined using the average of company stock prices beginning two days before and
ending two days after january28, 2005, the date the acquisition was announced. we also issued 79
million stock options in exchange for the gillette companys outstanding stock options. under the
purchase method of accounting, the total consideration was approximately $53.43billion including
common stock, the fair value of vested stock options and acquisition costs.
table of contents
the acquisition of the gillette company provides us with global market leadership in male
grooming, selected female grooming products, alkaline batteries and in manual and power
toothbrushes. total sales for the gillette company during its most recent pre-acquisition year
ended december31, 2004 were $10.5billion.
in order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction, we were required to divest certain
overlapping businesses. we completed the divestiture of the spinbrush toothbrush business,
rembrandt (a gillette oral care product line) and right guard and other gillette deodorant brands
during the fiscal year ended june30, 2006.
juice divestiture. in august2004 the company completed the divestiture of its juice business.
wella acquisition. in september2003, the company acquired a controlling interest in wella.
through a stock purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of wella and a tender offer made
on the remaining shares, we acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding wella shares (99% of the
voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares). in june2004, the company and wella entered
into a domination and profit transfer agreement (the domination agreement). under the domination
agreement, we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100% of the future
earnings of wella. as consideration for the domination agreement, we will pay the remaining
shareholders of wella a guaranteed annual dividend payment. alternatively, the remaining wella
shareholders may elect to tender their shares to the company for an agreed price. the fair value
of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments was $1.11billion, which is the approximate cost
if all remaining shares were tendered. during the year ended june30, 2006, a portion of the
remaining shares were tendered, resulting in a $944million reduction in our liability under the
domination agreement.
the total purchase price for wella, including acquisition costs, was $6.27billion based on
exchange rates at the acquisition dates. the acquisition was financed by a mixture of available
cash balances, debt and the liability recorded under the domination agreement.
hutchison acquisition. in june2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our china venture
from our partner, hutchison whampoa china ltd. (hutchison), giving us full ownership of our
operations in china. the net purchase price was $1.85billion, which is the purchase price of
$2.00billion net of minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of
the transaction. the acquisition was funded by debt.
item1a. risk factors.
we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our
business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, the annual report to shareholders, quarterly
reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for
historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on
financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may
become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are
inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our
expectations.
table of contents
the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may
adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.
this information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis (md&a) and
the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.
the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we
believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could
cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical
trends.
a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our
business.
we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and
products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers.
this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales,
advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. we expect to
achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher
margin businesses. if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our
market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted.
this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer
trends and habits. in addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation,
with respect to both products and operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that
lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world.
the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local
and global competitors.
across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local
competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the
environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address
these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including
pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents
granted to competition.
our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, primarily gillette, could impact our
business results.
since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to
successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the gillette
company. specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant
disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. in
addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the
expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions.
our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results.
our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw
materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. our costs in 2007 were impacted by
higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2008. therefore, our success is
dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions,
cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and
certain hedging transactions. in the manufacturing and general
overhead areas, we need to maintain key
table of contents
manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing
plant arrangements.
we face risks associated with significant international operations.
we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the
united states. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate
growth in developing regions. should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below
expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. in addition, economic
changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation,
deflation or decreased demand for our products. our success will depend in part on our ability to
manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant
geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other
hostile activities.
our business is subject to regulation in the u.s. and abroad.
changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in
which we do business. this includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related
laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. accordingly, our
ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and
intellectual property matters as well as those related to the integration of gillette and its
subsidiaries) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our results.
if the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a
material impact on our financial results.
our companys financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands,
particularly our billion-dollar brands. the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing
plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to
attract consumers. further, our companys results could be impacted if one of our leading brands
suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues.
a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a
significant impact on our business.
our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our
retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are
acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our
business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and
principles. further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads
to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. this can
be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law
and regulation changes. further, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were
to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products.
item1b. unresolved staff comments.
none.
item2. properties.
in the united states, we own and operate 39 manufacturing facilities located in 23 different
states. in addition, we own and operate 105 manufacturing facilities in 41 other countries. many
of the domestic and international facilities produce products for
multiple businesses.
table of contents
beauty
products are manufactured at 52 of these locations; health care products are manufactured at 21 of
these locations; fabric care and home care products at 42; baby care and family care products at
33; pet care, snacks and coffee products at 15; blades and razors at 8; and duracell and braun
products at 12. management believes that the companys production facilities are adequate to
support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.
item3. legal proceedings.
the company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out
of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation,
product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, and
taxes. in july2006, french authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition
law violations in france, entered the premises of a number of consumer products companies operating
there, including two of the companys french subsidiaries, and seized a variety of documents. no
formal claim has been made against the company or our french subsidiaries in connection with the
seizure of these documents. the company cannot predict what, if any, financial impact may result
from this situation. the companys policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including
all antitrust and competition laws.

the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan (belgian version)
no further grants can be made under the plan, although unexercised stock options previously
granted under this plan remain outstanding. this plan was approved by the companys board of
directors on february14, 1997. although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for
approval, it is nearly identical to the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan, approved by the companys
shareholders on october13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
belgian tax laws.
the plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key belgian employees. under the plan,
eligible participants were: (i)granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii)
granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii)granted shares of the companys common stock.
except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must
vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years
from the date of grant. the exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the
average price of the companys stock on the date of grant. if a recipient of a grant leaves the
company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become
void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of
departure, except in the case of death or retirement. any common stock awarded under the plan may
be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee
administering the plan may determine.
the procter & gamble future shares plan
on october14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the procter & gamble future
shares plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the companys common stock may be
granted to employees worldwide. the purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the
company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the companys future growth and success
and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the companys shareholders
through increased ownership of shares of the companys stock. the plan has not been submitted to
shareholders for approval.
subject to adjustment for changes in the companys capitalization, the number of shares to be
granted under the plan is not to exceed 17million shares. under the plans regulations,
recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the companys common stock at an exercise
price equal to the average price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant. these
options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant.
if a recipient leaves the employ of the company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than
disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.
at the time of the first grant following board approval of the plan, each employee of the
company not eligible for an award under the 1992 stock plan was granted options for 100 shares.
from the date of this first grant through june30, 2003, each new employee of the company has also
received options for 100 shares. following the grant of options on june30,
table of contents
2003, the company
suspended this part of the plan and intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan.
the plan will terminate on october13, 2007.
in addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares are granted to
approximately 3,000 employees who are not eligible for participation in the 2001 stock and
incentive compensation plan in recognition of outstanding performance. the companys key managers
are not eligible for such grants.
the gillette company 1971 stock option plan
no further grants can be made under the plan after april25, 2005, although unexercised stock
options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. the plan was approved by
shareholders of the gillette company and assumed by the company upon the merger between the procter
& gamble company and the gillette company. all options became immediately vested and exerciseable
on october1, 2005 as a result of the merger. after the merger, all outstanding options became
options to purchase shares of the procter & gamble company subject to an exchange ratio of .975
shares of p&g stock per share of gillette stock.
the plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key salaried employees of the gillette
company and non-employee members of its board of directors. under the plan, eligible participants
receive the option to purchase company stock at a pre-determined price which cannot be less than
100% of the fair market value per share at the time that the option is granted. the period of any
option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. subject to adjustment for changes in the
companys capitalization, the number of shares granted under the plan was not to exceed 198,000,000
shares.
if a recipient leaves the employ of the company for any reason other than death or discharge
for cause, the recipient is permitted to exercise any vested options granted under the for a period
between thirty days and five years after termination, depending on the circumstances of his/her
departure. if a participant is discharged for cause, all options are immediately cancelled. if a
participant dies while holding options, the options are exerciseable for a period of one to three
years depending on the date of grant. in addition, the plan allows gillette employees whose
employment is terminated for good reason within two years after the effective date of the merger
the ability to exercise remaining options for the shorter of five years following their termination
date or the original life of the grant. employees terminated for good reason who are also
eligible to retire under a company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the
original terms of the grant.
the gillette company 2004 long-term incentive plan
shareholders of the gillette company approved the gillette company 2004 long term incentive
plan on may20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the company upon the merger between the procter &
gamble company and the gillette company. all options became immediately vested and exerciseable on
october1, 2005 as a result of the merger. after the merger, all outstanding options became options
to purchase shares of the procter & gamble company subject to an exchange ratio of .975 shares of
p&g stock per share of gillette stock. only employees previously employed by the gillette company
prior to october1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan.
the plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of the gillette company, and
until the effective date of the merger between the gillette company and the
table of contents
procter & gamble
company, non-employee members of the gillette board of directors. under
the plan, eligible participants are: (i)granted or offered the right to purchase stock
options, (ii)granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii)granted shares of the companys common
stock or restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). subject to adjustment for changes in
the companys capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed
under the gillette company 1971 stock option plan, the number of shares to be granted under the
plan is not to exceed 19,000,000 shares.
except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights
must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. the exercise price for all stock
options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
companys stock on the date of grant. any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to
restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering
the plan may determine.
if a recipient of a grant leaves the company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1)
any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement,
special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the
compensation committee of the board of directors has waived the termination provisions; and (2)any
exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement, special
separation, voluntary resignation that is not for good reason (as those terms are defined in the
plan) or any grants as to which the compensation committee of the board of directors has waived the
termination provisions. in addition, the plan allows gillette employees whose employment was
terminated for good reason within two years of the effective date of the merger the ability to
exercise their options for the shorter of five years following their termination date or the
original life of the grant. employees terminated for good reason who are also eligible to retire
under a company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the original terms of the
grant.
