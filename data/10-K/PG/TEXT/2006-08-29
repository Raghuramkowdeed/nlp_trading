additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
managements discussion and analysis, which appears on pages 25-40; note 1, summary of significant
accounting policies, which appears on pages 46-49; note 2, acquisitions, which appears on pages
49-50; and note 12, segment information, which appears on pages 61-62 of the annual report to
shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2006. unless the context indicates otherwise, the
terms the company, p&g, we, our or us as used herein refers to the procter & gamble
company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.
the procter & gamble company is focused on providing branded consumer goods products of
superior quality and value to improve the lives of the worlds consumers. the company was
incorporated in ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter
and james gamble. today, we market our products in more than 180 countries.
throughout this form 10-k, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed
with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
the companys annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports
on form 8-k are filed electronically with the sec. the sec maintains an internet site that
contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. you can also access these reports through links
from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.jhtml.
copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting the procter & gamble
company, shareholder services department, p.o. box 5572, cincinnati, ohio 45201-5572.
financial information about segments
in april2006, we announced a number of changes to certain key leadership positions, which
resulted in changes to our organization structure and segment reporting. these changes dissolved
our family health global business unit (gbu)by re-aligning the component businesses within our
remaining gbus. specifically, pet health and nutrition, which used to be part of our health care
reportable segment, became part of our snacks and coffee reportable segment. the balance of our
health care reportable segment was combined with the p&g beauty gbu but will continue to be
reported as a separate reportable segment. in addition, our commercial products organization,
which primarily sells cleaning products directly to commercial end users, was moved from snacks and
coffee to the fabric care and home care reportable segment. finally, the adult incontinence
business was aligned with feminine care and as a consequence was removed from baby care and family
care and moved to p&g beauty. the balance of the baby care and family care reportable segment was
moved from the family health gbu to the household care gbu but will continue to be reported as a
separate reportable segment.
in
conjunction with these changes, the p&g beauty gbu was renamed beauty and health,
the snacks and coffee reporting segment was renamed pet health,
snacks and coffee, p&g household
care was renamed household care and the family health gbu was
table of contents
eliminated. all financial statements contained in this form 10-k, including historical financial
data, reflect the new segment reporting structure.
the company is organized into three global business units: beauty and health; household care;
and gillette gbu. we have seven reportable segments under u.s. gaap: beauty; health care; fabric
care and home care; pet health, snacks and coffee; baby care and family care; blades and razors;
and duracell and braun. many of the factors necessary
for an understanding of these businesses are similar. operating margins of the individual
businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the
products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. net sales growth by business is also
expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and
products. none of our businesses are highly seasonal except duracell and braun.
the duracell and braun segment has a disproportionately high level of sales in the december quarter
due to the december holiday season. in addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters,
such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries.
additional information about our businesses can be found in managements discussion and
analysis, pages 25-27, and note 12, segment information, which appears on pages 61-62 of the annual
report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2006.
narrative description of business
business model. our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing
brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. the markets and industry segments in
which we offer our products are highly competitive. our products are sold in over 180 countries
around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and
drug stores. we have also expanded our presence in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood
stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. we work collaboratively with our
customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the first moment of truth
when a consumer is shopping in the store. we must also win the second moment of truth  when a
consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a
good value. we believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the
consumer in order to grow our business. research and product development activities, designed to
enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe
these activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth.
key product categories. in 2006, one product category accounted for 10% or more of
consolidated net sales. the laundry category constituted approximately 16% of net sales for fiscal
year 2006, compared to 17% of net sales for fiscal year 2005 and 18% in 2004. in fiscal years 2005
and 2004, we had three product categories, including the laundry category described above, that
accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales. the diaper category represented approximately
11% of net sales in both 2005 and 2004. the retail hair care category accounted for approximately
10% of net sales in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. fiscal year 2006 net sales percentages for the
above categories decreased due to the addition of the gillette company on october1, 2005.
table of contents
key customers. our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club
stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. sales to wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates
represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2006, 16% in 2005 and 17% in 2004. no other
customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. our top ten customers account for
approximately 31% of total unit volume in 2006, compared to 32% in 2005 and 33% in 2004. the
nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. we
believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent
with the industry segments in which we compete.
sources and availability of materials. almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by
the company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. we produce raw
materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. in addition, fuel
and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks used to deliver our
products to customers. the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to
fluctuation. when prices for these items change, we may or may not pass on the change to our
customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. in 2006, we increased
prices in many categories, including fabric care, home care, baby care, family care, pet health and
coffee to recover increases in commodity costs. the company purchases a substantial
variety of raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material to our business taken as a
whole.
trademarks and patents. we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which
are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. some of these patents or licenses
cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. the
trademarks of all major products in each business are registered. in part, our success can be
attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.
competitive condition. the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. our
products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known
global competitors. we market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to
build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. we believe this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. product
quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.
research and development expenditures. research and development expenditures enable p&g to
develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and
improve the lives of its consumers. total research and development expenses were $2,075million in
2006, $1,940million in 2005 and $1,802million in 2004.
expenditures for environmental compliance. expenditures for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not
material to the company. no material change is expected in fiscal year 2007.
employees. the company has approximately 138,000 employees. the increase of approximately
28,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily related to the addition of the
table of contents
gillette
company. during the fiscal year, approximately 2,800 employee positions were eliminated from the
company as a result of the gillette acquisition.
financial information about foreign and domestic operations
net sales in the united states account for approximately 43% of total net sales. no other
individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. operations outside the united
states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the
business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values,
different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and
disruptions. our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june30 were as follows:

development of the business
the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including
the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over the past three years.
gillette acquisition. on october1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of the gillette
company. pursuant to the acquisition agreement, which provided for the exchange of 0.975 shares of
the procter & gamble company common stock, on a tax-free basis, for each share of the gillette
company, we issued 962million shares of the procter & gamble company common stock. the value of
these shares was determined using the average of company stock prices beginning two days before and
ending two days after january28, 2005, the date the acquisition was announced. we also issued 79
million stock options in exchange for the gillette companys outstanding stock options. under the
purchase method of accounting, the total consideration was approximately $53.43billion including
common stock, the fair value of vested stock options and acquisition costs.
the acquisition of the gillette company provides us with global market leadership in male
grooming, selected female grooming products, alkaline batteries and in manual and power
toothbrushes. total sales for the gillette company during its most recent year ended december31,
2004 were $10.5billion.
table of contents
in order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction, we were required to divest certain
overlapping businesses. we completed the divestiture of the spinbrush toothbrush business,
rembrandt (a gillette oral care product line) and right guard and other gillette deodorant brands
during the fiscal year ended june30, 2006.
juice divestiture. in august2004 the company completed the divestiture of its juice business.
wella acquisition. in september2003, the company acquired a controlling interest in wella.
through a stock purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of wella and a tender offer made
on the remaining shares, we acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding wella shares (99% of the
voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares). in june2004, the company and wella entered
into a domination and profit transfer agreement (the domination agreement). under the domination
agreement, we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100% of the future
earnings of wella. as consideration for the domination agreement, we will pay the remaining
shareholders of wella a guaranteed annual dividend payment. alternatively, the remaining wella
shareholders may elect to tender their shares to the company for an agreed price. the fair value
of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments was $1.11billion, which is the approximate cost
if all remaining shares were tendered. during the year ended june30, 2006, a portion of the
remaining shares were tendered, resulting in a $944million reduction in our liability under the
domination agreement.
the total purchase price for wella, including acquisition costs, was $6.27billion based on
exchange rates at the acquisition dates. the acquisition was financed by a mixture of available
cash balances, debt and the liability recorded under the domination agreement.
hutchison acquisition. in june2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our china venture
from our partner, hutchison whampoa china ltd. (hutchison), giving us full ownership of our
operations in china. the net purchase price was $1.85billion, which is the purchase price of
$2.00billion net of minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of
the transaction. the acquisition was funded by debt.
item1a. risk factors.
we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our
business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, the annual report to shareholders, quarterly
reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for
historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on
financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may
become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are
inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our
expectations.
the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may
adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.
this information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis (md&a) and
the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.
the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight
table of contents
what we
believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these
factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements
and from historical trends.
a material change in the demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.
we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and
products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers
and retail trade customers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to
manage and maintain key customer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales,
advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. in addition,
our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and
operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products
that appeal to our consumers across the world.
the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local
and global competitors.
across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local
competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the
environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address
these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including
pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents
granted to competition.
our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, primarily gillette, could impact our
business results.
since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to
successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the gillette
company. specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant
disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. in
addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the
expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions.
our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results.
our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw
materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. our costs in 2006 were impacted by
higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2007. therefore, our success is
dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions,
cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging
transactions. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key
manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant
arrangements.
we face risks associated with significant international operations.
we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the
united states. economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business
interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. our success will depend
in part on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty,
table of contents
especially
in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to
terrorist and other hostile activities.
our business is subject to regulation in the u.s. and abroad.
changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in
which we do business. this includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related
laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. accordingly, our
ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and
intellectual property matters as well as those related to the integration of gillette and its
subsidiaries) and to resolve pending matters within current estimates may impact our results.
item1b. unresolved staff comments.
none.
item2. properties.
in the united states, we own and operate 39 manufacturing facilities located in 23 different
states. in addition, we own and operate 107 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. many
of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. beauty
products are manufactured at 52 of these locations; health care products are manufactured at 22 of
these locations; fabric care and home care products at 43; baby care and family care products at
32; pet health, snacks and coffee products at 15; blades and razors at 8; and duracell and braun
products at 13. management believes that the companys production facilities are adequate to
support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.
item3. legal proceedings.
we are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our
business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product
liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, and taxes.
based on currently available information, no such legal proceeding or claim is expected to
materially impact our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
item4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders.
not applicable.

the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan (belgian version)
no further grants can be made under the plan, although unexercised stock options previously
granted under this plan remain outstanding. this plan was approved by the companys board of
directors on february14, 1997. although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for
approval, it is nearly identical to the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan, approved by the companys
shareholders on october13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
belgian tax laws.
the plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key belgian employees. under the plan,
eligible participants were: (i)granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii)
granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii)granted shares of the companys common stock.
except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must
vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years
from the date of grant. the exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the
average price of the companys stock on the date of grant. if a recipient of a grant leaves the
company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately become
void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month of
departure, except in the case of death or retirement. any common stock awarded under the plan may
be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee
administering the plan may determine.
the procter & gamble future shares plan
on october14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the procter & gamble future
shares plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the companys common stock may be
granted to employees worldwide. the purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the
company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the companys future growth and success
and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the companys shareholders
through increased ownership of shares of the companys stock. the plan has not been submitted to
shareholders for approval.
subject to adjustment for changes in the companys capitalization, the number of shares to be
granted under the plan is not to exceed 17million shares. under the plans regulations,
recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the companys common stock at an exercise
price equal to the average price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant. these
options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant.
if a recipient leaves the employ of the company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than
disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.
at the time of the first grant following board approval of the plan, each employee of the
company not eligible for an award under the 1992 stock plan was granted options for 100 shares.
from the date of this first grant through june30, 2003, each new employee of the company has also
received options for 100 shares. following the grant of options on june30,
table of contents
2003, the company
suspended this part of the plan and intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan.
in addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares are granted to
approximately 3,000 employees who are not eligible for participation in the 2001 stock and
incentive compensation plan in recognition of outstanding performance. the companys key managers
are not eligible for such grants.
