COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER GOODS PRODUCTS OF

SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE WORLDS CONSUMERS. THE COMPANY WAS

INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER

AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

IN APRIL 2006, WE ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO CERTAIN KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, WHICH

RESULTED IN CHANGES TO OUR ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE AND SEGMENT REPORTING. THESE CHANGES DISSOLVED

OUR FAMILY HEALTH GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT (GBU) BY RE-ALIGNING THE COMPONENT BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR

REMAINING GBUS. SPECIFICALLY, PET HEALTH AND NUTRITION, WHICH USED TO BE PART OF OUR HEALTH CARE

REPORTABLE SEGMENT, BECAME PART OF OUR SNACKS AND COFFEE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE BALANCE OF OUR

HEALTH CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT WAS COMBINED WITH THE P&G BEAUTY GBU BUT WILL CONTINUE TO BE

REPORTED AS A SEPARATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ORGANIZATION,

WHICH PRIMARILY SELLS CLEANING PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO COMMERCIAL END USERS, WAS MOVED FROM SNACKS AND

COFFEE TO THE FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. FINALLY, THE ADULT INCONTINENCE

BUSINESS WAS ALIGNED WITH FEMININE CARE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WAS REMOVED FROM BABY CARE AND FAMILY

CARE AND MOVED TO P&G BEAUTY. THE BALANCE OF THE BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT WAS

MOVED FROM THE FAMILY HEALTH GBU TO THE HOUSEHOLD CARE GBU BUT WILL CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED AS A

SEPARATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THESE CHANGES, THE P&G BEAUTY GBU WAS RENAMED BEAUTY AND HEALTH,

THE SNACKS AND COFFEE REPORTING SEGMENT WAS RENAMED PET HEALTH,

SNACKS AND COFFEE, P&G HOUSEHOLD

CARE WAS RENAMED HOUSEHOLD CARE AND THE FAMILY HEALTH GBU WAS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ELIMINATED. ALL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDING HISTORICAL FINANCIAL

DATA, REFLECT THE NEW SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS: BEAUTY AND HEALTH; HOUSEHOLD CARE;

AND GILLETTE GBU. WE HAVE SEVEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP: BEAUTY; HEALTH CARE; FABRIC

CARE AND HOME CARE; PET HEALTH, SNACKS AND COFFEE; BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE; BLADES AND RAZORS;

AND DURACELL AND BRAUN. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY

FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE SIMILAR. OPERATING MARGINS OF THE INDIVIDUAL

BUSINESSES VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE THE

PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND DIFFERENCES IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. NET SALES GROWTH BY BUSINESS IS ALSO

EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS OF EACH BUSINESS AND

PRODUCTS. NONE OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY SEASONAL EXCEPT DURACELL AND BRAUN.

THE DURACELL AND BRAUN SEGMENT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH LEVEL OF SALES IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER

DUE TO THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON. IN ADDITION, ANTICIPATION OR OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,

SUCH AS HURRICANES, CAN DRIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH DEMAND FOR BATTERIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS, PAGES 25-27, AND NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 61-62 OF THE ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL

. OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF EXISTING

BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN OVER 180 COUNTRIES

AROUND THE WORLD PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES AND

DRUG STORES. WE HAVE ALSO EXPANDED OUR PRESENCE IN HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, THE NEIGHBORHOOD

STORES WHICH SERVE MANY CONSUMERS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR

CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE PRESENCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTH 

WHEN A CONSUMER IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE. WE MUST ALSO WIN THE SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN A

CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER IT WAS A

GOOD VALUE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BRANDING TO THE

CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO

ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.

WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, WE BELIEVE

THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES

. IN 2006, ONE PRODUCT CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 16% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL

YEAR 2006, COMPARED TO 17% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND 18% IN 2004. IN FISCAL YEARS 2005

AND 2004, WE HAD THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, THAT

ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE DIAPER CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY

11% OF NET SALES IN BOTH 2005 AND 2004. THE RETAIL HAIR CARE CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

10% OF NET SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2005 AND 2004. FISCAL YEAR 2006 NET SALES PERCENTAGES FOR THE

ABOVE CATEGORIES DECREASED DUE TO THE ADDITION OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY ON OCTOBER 1, 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KEY CUSTOMERS

. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB

STORES, DRUG STORES AND HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES. SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2006, 16% IN 2005 AND 17% IN 2004. NO OTHER

CUSTOMER REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR

APPROXIMATELY 31% OF TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2006, COMPARED TO 32% IN 2005 AND 33% IN 2004. THE

NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WE

BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS USED BY

THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. WE PRODUCE RAW

MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, FUEL

AND NATURAL GAS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES USED IN OUR PLANTS AND IN THE TRUCKS USED TO DELIVER OUR

PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND OTHER COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO

FLUCTUATION. WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS ON THE CHANGE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS, DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND EXPECTED DURATION OF THE CHANGE. IN 2006, WE INCREASED

PRICES IN MANY CATEGORIES, INCLUDING FABRIC CARE, HOME CARE, BABY CARE, FAMILY CARE, PET HEALTH AND

COFFEE TO RECOVER INCREASES IN COMMODITY COSTS. THE COMPANY PURCHASES A SUBSTANTIAL

VARIETY OF RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS TAKEN AS A

WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

. WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH

ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACTIVITY IN ALL BUSINESSES. SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES

COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS. THE

TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN EACH BUSINESS ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, OUR SUCCESS CAN BE

ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

COMPETITIVE CONDITION.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR

PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST SIMILAR PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN

GLOBAL COMPETITORS. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO

BUILD AWARENESS OF OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS

COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT

QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ENABLE P&G TO

DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND OBTAIN PATENTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS AND

IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ITS CONSUMERS. TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $2,075 MILLION IN

2006, $1,940 MILLION IN 2005 AND $1,802 MILLION IN 2004.

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

. EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2007.

EMPLOYEES

. THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 138,000 EMPLOYEES. THE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

28,000 EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ADDITION OF THE

GILLETTE

COMPANY. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR, APPROXIMATELY 2,800 EMPLOYEE POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED FROM THE

COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE GILLETTE ACQUISITION.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF TOTAL NET SALES. NO OTHER

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY HAD NET SALES EXCEEDING 10% OF TOTAL NET SALES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES,

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND

DISRUPTIONS. OUR SALES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING

THE MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.

GILLETTE ACQUISITION.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE EXCHANGE OF 0.975 SHARES OF

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK, ON A TAX-FREE BASIS, FOR EACH SHARE OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY, WE ISSUED 962 MILLION SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY COMMON STOCK. THE VALUE OF

THESE SHARES WAS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE OF COMPANY STOCK PRICES BEGINNING TWO DAYS BEFORE AND

ENDING TWO DAYS AFTER JANUARY 28, 2005, THE DATE THE ACQUISITION WAS ANNOUNCED. WE ALSO ISSUED 79

MILLION STOCK OPTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS. UNDER THE

PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $53.43 BILLION INCLUDING

COMMON STOCK, THE FAIR VALUE OF VESTED STOCK OPTIONS AND ACQUISITION COSTS.

THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY PROVIDES US WITH GLOBAL MARKET LEADERSHIP IN MALE

GROOMING, SELECTED FEMALE GROOMING PRODUCTS, ALKALINE BATTERIES AND IN MANUAL AND POWER

TOOTHBRUSHES. TOTAL SALES FOR THE GILLETTE COMPANY DURING ITS MOST RECENT YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004 WERE $10.5 BILLION.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTION, WE WERE REQUIRED TO DIVEST CERTAIN

OVERLAPPING BUSINESSES. WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SPINBRUSH TOOTHBRUSH BUSINESS,

REMBRANDT (A GILLETTE ORAL CARE PRODUCT LINE) AND RIGHT GUARD AND OTHER GILLETTE DEODORANT BRANDS

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006.

JUICE DIVESTITURE.

IN AUGUST 2004 THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF ITS JUICE BUSINESS.

WELLA ACQUISITION

. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA.

THROUGH A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA AND A TENDER OFFER MADE

ON THE REMAINING SHARES, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE OUTSTANDING WELLA SHARES (99% OF THE

VOTING CLASS SHARES AND 45% OF THE PREFERENCE SHARES). IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY AND WELLA ENTERED

INTO A DOMINATION AND PROFIT TRANSFER AGREEMENT (THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT). UNDER THE DOMINATION

AGREEMENT, WE ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE FULL OPERATING CONTROL AND RECEIVE 100% OF THE FUTURE

EARNINGS OF WELLA. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE WILL PAY THE REMAINING

SHAREHOLDERS OF WELLA A GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, THE REMAINING WELLA

SHAREHOLDERS MAY ELECT TO TENDER THEIR SHARES TO THE COMPANY FOR AN AGREED PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE TOTAL GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WAS $1.11 BILLION, WHICH IS THE APPROXIMATE COST

IF ALL REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED. DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, A PORTION OF THE

REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED, RESULTING IN A $944 MILLION REDUCTION IN OUR LIABILITY UNDER THE

DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR WELLA, INCLUDING ACQUISITION COSTS, WAS $6.27 BILLION BASED ON

EXCHANGE RATES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. THE ACQUISITION WAS FINANCED BY A MIXTURE OF AVAILABLE

CASH BALANCES, DEBT AND THE LIABILITY RECORDED UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

HUTCHISON ACQUISITION

. IN JUNE 2004, WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 20% STAKE OF OUR CHINA VENTURE

FROM OUR PARTNER, HUTCHISON WHAMPOA CHINA LTD. (HUTCHISON), GIVING US FULL OWNERSHIP OF OUR

OPERATIONS IN CHINA. THE NET PURCHASE PRICE WAS $1.85 BILLION, WHICH IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF

$2.00 BILLION NET OF MINORITY INTEREST AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF

THE TRANSACTION. THE ACQUISITION WAS FUNDED BY DEBT.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

WE DISCUSS OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS FORM 10-K, THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY

REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. ALL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR

HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ARE BASED ON

FINANCIAL DATA AND BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY

BECOME OUT OF DATE OR INCOMPLETE. WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHER FACTORS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR

EXPECTATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) AND

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHAT WE

BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE

FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

AND FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND

PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS

AND RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS. THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE AND MAINTAIN KEY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES,

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION,

OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND

OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS

THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL

AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE

ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS

THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS

GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY GILLETTE, COULD IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS RESULTS.

SINCE OUR GOALS INCLUDE A GROWTH COMPONENT TIED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION TO OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND EXECUTE BUSINESS PLANS ON OUR BASE BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE

EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW

MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. OUR COSTS IN 2006 WERE IMPACTED BY

HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 2007. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS,

COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND CERTAIN HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING PLANT

ARRANGEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. ECONOMIC CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION, INFLATION, DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND

IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY,

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESPECIALLY

IN OUR SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO

TERRORIST AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED

LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAXATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS AS WELL AS THOSE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF GILLETTE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OWN AND OPERATE 39 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN 23 DIFFERENT

STATES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN AND OPERATE 107 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 42 OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY

OF THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESSES. BEAUTY

PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AT 52 OF THESE LOCATIONS; HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AT 22 OF

THESE LOCATIONS; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS AT 43; BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE PRODUCTS AT

32; PET HEALTH, SNACKS AND COFFEE PRODUCTS AT 15; BLADES AND RAZORS AT 8; AND DURACELL AND BRAUN

PRODUCTS AT 13. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO

SUPPORT THE BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

WE ARE SUBJECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OUR

BUSINESS, WHICH COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS, INCLUDING ANTITRUST AND TRADE REGULATION, PRODUCT

LIABILITY, ADVERTISING, CONTRACTS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, PATENT AND TRADEMARK MATTERS, AND TAXES.

BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, NO SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS EXPECTED TO

MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY

GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, 1997. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR

APPROVAL, IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS

SHAREHOLDERS ON OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN,

ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE: (I) GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II)

GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST

VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE

AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE

COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME

VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH OF

DEPARTURE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN MAY

BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE

ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE

SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE

GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE

COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS

AND TO STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS

THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO

SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE

GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS,

RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. THESE

OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT.

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN

DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING BOARD APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE

COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES.

FROM THE DATE OF THIS FIRST GRANT THROUGH JUNE 30, 2003, EACH NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FOLLOWING THE GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30,

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2003, THE COMPANY

SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN AND INTENDS TO MAKE NO FURTHER GRANTS UNDER THIS PART OF THE PLAN.

IN ADDITION TO THE GRANTS ABOVE, ANNUAL GRANTS OF OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES ARE GRANTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 2001 STOCK AND

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS KEY MANAGERS

ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH GRANTS.
