part i  item1. business.  additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
managements discussion and analysis (md&a), which appears on pages 31-48; note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, which appears on pages 54-56; and note 11, segment information, which appears on pages 69-70 of the 2009 annual
report. unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the company, p&g, we, our or us as used herein refers to the procter& gamble company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.  the procter& gamble company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value
to improve the lives of the worlds consumers. the company was incorporated in ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter and james gamble. today, we market our products in more than 180 countries.
throughout this form 10-k, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the securities and exchange commission
(sec).  the companys annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k are filed
electronically with the sec. the sec maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. you can also access these reports through links from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.shtml.  copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting the procter& gamble company, shareholder services department, p.o.
box 5572, cincinnati, ohio 45201-5572.  financial information about segments  as of june30, 2009, the company was organized into three global business units: beauty; health and well-being; and household care. we had six
reportable segments under u.s. gaap: beauty; grooming; health care; snacks and pet care; fabric care and home care; and baby care and family care. many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar. operating margins
of the individual businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales. net sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each business and products. while none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain of our reportable
segments, such as batteries (fabric care and home care), braun (grooming) and prestige fragrances (beauty) are seasonal. in addition, anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high demand for batteries.
additional information about our businesses can be found in md&a and note 11, segment information, which appear on pages 31-48 and
69-70, respectively, of the 2009 annual report.  narrative description of business  business model. our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the creation of new
products. the markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier value and low-tier
economy products). generally speaking, we compete with super-premium, premium and mid-tier value products. our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club
stores, drug
stores and in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in developing markets. we work collaboratively with our
customers to improve the in-store presence of our products and win the first moment of truthwhen a consumer is shopping in the store. we must also win the second moment of truthwhen a consumer uses the product,
evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value. we believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business. research and product development
activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. while many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate
our commitment to future growth.  key product categories. in 2009, two product categories accounted for 10% or more of consolidated
net sales. the laundry category constituted approximately 17% of net sales in 2009 and 16% for the fiscal years 2008 and 2007. the diaper category constituted approximately 11% of net sales for fiscal year 2009 and 10% in 2008.  key customers. our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. sales to
wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2009, 2008 and 2007. no other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. our top ten customers account for approximately 30% of our total unit
volume in 2009, compared to 31% of total unit volume in 2008 and 30% in 2007. the nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. we believe our practices related to working capital items for customers
and suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete.  sources and availability of materials. almost all of
the raw and packaging materials used by the company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. we produce raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. in addition, fuel, natural gas and
derivative products are important commodities used in our plants, products and in the trucks used to deliver our products to customers. the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. when prices for these items
change, we may or may not pass on the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change. the company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material to our
business taken as a whole.  trademarks and patents. we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which are used
in connection with our activity in all businesses. some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. the trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our
products. all major products and trademarks in each business are registered. in part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.  competitive condition. the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. our products compete against similar products of many
large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. in many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers private-label brands. we are well
positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operateoften holding a leadership or significant market share position. we market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of our brands in
conjunction with an extensive sales force. we believe this combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.
research and development expenditures. research and development expenditures enable us to develop technologies and obtain patents across all
categories in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of our consumers. total research and development expenses were $2,044 million in 2009, $2,212 million in 2008 and $2,100 million in 2007.
expenditures for environmental compliance. expenditures for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not material to the company. no material change is expected in fiscal year 2010.  employees. the company has approximately 135,000 employees.  financial information about foreign and domestic
operations  net sales in the united states account for approximately 39% of total net sales. no other individual country had net sales
exceeding 10% of total net sales. operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency
values, different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and disruptions. our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june30 were as follows:

development of the business  the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets since the beginning of fiscal 2009.  coffee divestiture. in november 2008, the company completed the divestiture of our coffee business through the merger of our folgers coffee
subsidiary into the j.m. smucker company (smucker) in an all-stock reverse morris trust transaction. in connection with the merger, 38.7million shares of common stock of the company were tendered by shareholders and exchanged for all shares of
folgers common stock, resulting in an increase of treasury stock of $2.5 billion. pursuant to the merger, a smucker subsidiary merged with and into folgers and folgers became a wholly owned subsidiary of smucker. the company recorded an after-tax
gain on the transaction of $2.0 billion.  item1a. risk factors.  we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, the annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and
other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements
are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking
statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.  the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations,
financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with md&a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. the following discussion of
risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from
historical trends.  a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.  we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell
products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. we expect to achieve our financial
targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be
negatively impacted. this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. in addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and
operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world.  the
ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors.  across all of
our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.
to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition.  our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results.  our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued
ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key
manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements.  we face risks associated with
significant international operations.  we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united
states. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested
in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. that can increase our exposure. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number
of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, china and india. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks. further, we
expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by
achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions,
our results could be negatively impacted. in addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. our success will depend, in part, on our
ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities.  if the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.  our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. the success of these brands can suffer
if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumers. further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment
to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues.  our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business
results.  we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and
workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business
success. in addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. further, our financial
targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted.  our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results.  as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities.
we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the
expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from
the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands.  our business is subject to regulation in the u.s. and abroad.  changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. this includes changes in environmental,
competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property
matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i, item3 of this form 10-k, which could require us to take significant reserves or pay
significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. in addition, as a u.s. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the u.s. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are
interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if these or other tax regulations should change, our
financial results could be impacted.
a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on
our business.  our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this
includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and
principles. further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. this
can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. in addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory
level of our products.  we face risks related to the current credit crisis.  we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary
funding capacity.however, current uncertainty in global economic conditions, resulting from disruptions in credit markets, poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our
ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. if the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as
reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial
intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market, it could impair our ability to
fund discretionary spending.  a failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to
conduct business.  we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to
interact with internal and external stakeholders. these interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions,
summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes,
ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our
results of operations and/or financial condition.  item1b. unresolved staff comments.  none.  item2. properties.  in the u.s., we own and operate 36 manufacturing facilities located in 22 different states. in addition, we own and operate 105 manufacturing facilities
in 43 other countries. many of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. beauty products are manufactured at 43 of these locations; grooming products at 14; fabric care and home care products at 51; baby
care and family care products at 29; pet care and snacks products at 11; and health care products at 35. management believes that the companys production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and
equipment have been well maintained.
item3. legal proceedings.  the company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability,
advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters and taxes.  the company is subject to a variety of
investigations into potential competition law violations in europe. in july2006, french authorities, in connection with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in france, entered the premises of two of the companys french
subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents.in april 2008, authorities in the united kingdom (uk) initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the uk involving one of the companys subsidiaries. in june 2008,
european commission officials, with the assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the european union.around the same
time, the national authorities in spain, italy and the czech republic initiated additional investigations into potential antitrust concerns within those countries.in connection with these investigations, a number of the companys
subsidiaries were visited and documents seized.the company or its subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in belgium, romania, switzerland, france and greece, as well as some other countries. we believe that all
of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products companies and/or retail customers.  the companys policy is to comply
with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws, and to cooperate with investigations by relevant regulatory authorities, which the company is doing. competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several
years and, if violations are found, can result in substantial fines. in other industries, fines have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. during the fiscal year ended june30, 2008, certain of the companys subsidiaries in germany
received a formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws. we are now discussing the situation with the german authorities. at this point, no other formal claims have been made against the company or any of our subsidiaries in connection
with any of the above inquiries.  in response to the actions of the commission and national authorities, the company has launched its own
internal investigations into potential violations of competition laws, some of which are ongoing. the company has identified violations in certain european countries and appropriate actions are being taken. it is still too early for us to reasonably
estimate the fines to which the company will be subject as a result of these competition law issues. however, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate.please refer to the companys risk factors in item1a of this form 10-k
for additional information.  in december 2008, the company became aware of an investigation by italian authorities into an environmental
accident at the site of a contractor which provides services to one or more of the companys european affiliates. the accident involved the explosion of certain pressurized cans and resulted in the death of one worker and serious injuries to
another. italian authorities are formally investigating whether the companys affiliates complied with italian laws related to the proper classification and disposal of their products. should they find that these entities violated the law, the
italian authorities could levy fines in excess of $100 thousand against the companys european affiliate(s).  item4. submission of matters to
a vote of security holders.  not applicable.
