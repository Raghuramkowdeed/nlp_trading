item1. business.
general development of
business
the procter & gamble company was incorporated in ohio in 1905, having been
built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter and james gamble.
today, the company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products
in many countries throughout the world.
unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the company as used
herein refers to the procter & gamble company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.
in 1999, the company announced its intention to transition from its
previous geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit
structure. concurrent with that change, the company initiated a multi-year
restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein by
reference to note 2, restructuring program, which appears on pages 33-34 of the
annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2002. on
november16, 2001, the company completed the acquisition of the clairol
business from bristol-myers squibb company and, on may31, 2002, the company
completed the spin-off of the jif peanut butter and crisco shortening brands to
the companys shareholders and their subsequent merger into the j.m. smucker
company. additional information about these two transactions is incorporated
herein by reference to note 3, acquisitions and spin-off, which appears on
pages 34-35 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june
30, 2002. additional information required by this item is incorporated herein
by reference to the letter to shareholders, which appears on pages 1-14 of the
annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2002.
financial information about
industry segments
the companys products fall into five business segments: fabric and home
care; baby, feminine and family care; beauty care; health care; and food and
beverage.
additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to note 13, segment information, of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, which appears on page 44, and financial review, which
appears on pages 17-25 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year
ended june30, 2002.
table of contents
narrative description of
business
the companys business, represented by the aggregate of its fabric and
home care; baby, feminine and family care; beauty care; health care; and food
and beverage segments, is essentially homogeneous. none of these segments are
seasonal. many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these five
segments are similar. the primary differences relate to the degree of capital
intensity of the businesses, which may affect gross margin trends versus
operating margins. the markets in which the companys products are sold are
highly competitive. the products of the companys business segments compete
with many large and small companies, and there is no dominant competitor or
competitors. advertising is used in conjunction with an extensive sales force,
because the company believes this combination provides the most efficient
method of marketing for these types of products. product quality, performance,
value and packaging are also important competitive factors. most of the
companys products in each of its segments are distributed through food, drug,
mass and other retail outlets.
the laundry and diaper categories constitute approximately 19% and 12% of
consolidated fiscal 2002 sales, respectively. these results are comparable to
the year before. the creation of new products and the development of new
performance benefits for consumers on the companys existing products are vital
ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive markets in
which it does business. basic research and product development activities
continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. while many of
the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, the
company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to future growth.
the company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. some
of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the companys products. the trademarks of all major products in
each segment are registered. in part, the companys success can be attributed
to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and
licenses.
most of the raw materials used by the company are purchased from others,
some of whom are single-source suppliers. additionally, some raw materials,
primarily chemicals, are produced by the company for further use in the
manufacturing process. the company purchases and produces a substantial
variety of raw materials, no one of which is material to the companys business
taken as a whole.
expenditures in fiscal year 2002 for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different from
such expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is expected in
fiscal year 2003.
operations outside the united states are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and economic growth.
the company has approximately 102,000 employees. the decline of
approximately 4,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily from
separations related to the companys restructuring program, partially offset
due to increased enrollment from the clairol acquisition.

in the united states, the company owns and operates 36 manufacturing

the company has made and will make certain forward-looking statements in
the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended june30, 2002 and
in other contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market
shares, financial goals and cost reduction, among others.
these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates
regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic
conditions, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action
and the development of certain markets. among the key factors necessary to
achieve the companys goals are: (1)the successful integration of the
companys new organization structure, including achievement of expected cost
and tax savings; (2)the ability to achieve business plans, including growing
volume profitably, despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with
respect to the product categories and geographical markets in which the company
has chosen to focus; (3)the ability to maintain key customer relationships;
(4)the achievement of growth in significant developing markets such as china,
turkey, mexico, the southern cone of latin america, the countries of central
and eastern europe and the countries of southeast asia; (5)the ability to
successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including resolution of
pending matters within current estimates; (6)the successful and timely
execution of planned brand divestitures; (7)the ability to successfully
implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and
overhead areas; (8)the ability to successfully manage currency (including
currency issues in latin america), interest rate and certain commodity cost
exposures; and (9)the ability to manage the continued political and/or
economic uncertainty in latin america and the middle east, as well as any
political and/or economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities. if the
companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition,
or if the company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the companys
actual performance could vary materially from the forward-looking statements
made herein.

the procter & gamble 1992
stock plan (belgian version)
effective february14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the
procter & gamble 1992 stock plan (belgian version). although the plan has not
been submitted to shareholders for approval, the plan is nearly identical to
the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan, approved by the companys shareholders on
october13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
belgian tax laws.
the plan is a stock incentive plan designed to attract, retain, and
motivate key belgian employees. under the plan, eligible participants may be
granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, may be granted stock
appreciation rights, and/or may be granted shares of the companys common
stock. except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and
stock appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of
grant and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. the
exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average
price of the companys stock on the date of grant. if a recipient of a grant
leaves the company while holding an unexercised option or right, any
unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death,
and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except
in the case of death or retirement. any common stock awarded under the plan
may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is
employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.
the procter & gamble future
shares plan
on october14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the procter
& gamble future shares plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the
companys common stock, may be granted to employees worldwide. the purpose of
this plan is to advance the interests of the company by giving substantially
all employees a stake in the companys future growth and success and to
strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the companys
shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the companys stock. the
plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval.
subject to adjustment for changes in the companys capitalization, the
number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17million
shares. under the plans regulations, recipients are granted options to
acquire 100 shares of the companys common stock at an exercise price equal to
the average price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant.
these options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years
following the date of grant. if a recipient leaves the employ of the company
prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or
special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.
at the time of the first grant following approval of the plan, each
employee of the company not eligible for an award under the 1992 stock plan was
granted options for 100 shares. since the date of the first grant, each new
employee of the company has also received options for 100 shares.
