PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF

BUSINESS

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN

BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE.

TODAY, THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS

IN MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE TERM THE COMPANY AS USED

HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO TRANSITION FROM ITS

PREVIOUS GEOGRAPHIC-BASED STRUCTURE TO A PRODUCT-BASED GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT

STRUCTURE. CONCURRENT WITH THAT CHANGE, THE COMPANY INITIATED A MULTI-YEAR

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, A DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 2, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 33-34 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002. ON

NOVEMBER 16, 2001, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE CLAIROL

BUSINESS FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY AND, ON MAY 31, 2002, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF THE JIF PEANUT BUTTER AND CRISCO SHORTENING BRANDS TO

THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT MERGER INTO THE J.M. SMUCKER

COMPANY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TWO TRANSACTIONS IS INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE TO NOTE 3, ACQUISITIONS AND SPIN-OFF, WHICH APPEARS ON

PAGES 34-35 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE

30, 2002. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN

BY REFERENCE TO THE LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 1-14 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: FABRIC AND HOME

CARE; BABY, FEMININE AND FAMILY CARE; BEAUTY CARE; HEALTH CARE; AND FOOD AND

BEVERAGE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE TO NOTE 13, SEGMENT INFORMATION, OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGE 44, AND FINANCIAL REVIEW, WHICH

APPEARS ON PAGES 17-25 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR

ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF

BUSINESS

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, REPRESENTED BY THE AGGREGATE OF ITS FABRIC AND

HOME CARE; BABY, FEMININE AND FAMILY CARE; BEAUTY CARE; HEALTH CARE; AND FOOD

AND BEVERAGE SEGMENTS, IS ESSENTIALLY HOMOGENEOUS. NONE OF THESE SEGMENTS ARE

SEASONAL. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FIVE

SEGMENTS ARE SIMILAR. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES RELATE TO THE DEGREE OF CAPITAL

INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES, WHICH MAY AFFECT GROSS MARGIN TRENDS VERSUS

OPERATING MARGINS. THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THE PRODUCTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETE

WITH MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, AND THERE IS NO DOMINANT COMPETITOR OR

COMPETITORS. ADVERTISING IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE,

BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT

METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,

VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS. MOST OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN EACH OF ITS SEGMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH FOOD, DRUG,

MASS AND OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS.

THE LAUNDRY AND DIAPER CATEGORIES CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 19% AND 12% OF

CONSOLIDATED FISCAL 2002 SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE TO

THE YEAR BEFORE. THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS ON THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VITAL

INGREDIENTS IN ITS CONTINUING PROGRESS IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS IN

WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS. BASIC RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR. WHILE MANY OF

THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED TRADEMARKS AND OWNS OR HAS LICENSES UNDER

PATENTS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS BUSINESS IN ALL SEGMENTS. SOME

OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND

PROCESSING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN

EACH SEGMENT ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, THE COMPANYS SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED

TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND

LICENSES.

MOST OF THE RAW MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS,

SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME RAW MATERIALS,

PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, ARE PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY FOR FURTHER USE IN THE

MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE COMPANY PURCHASES AND PRODUCES A SUBSTANTIAL

VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, NO ONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR 2002 FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

SUCH EXPENDITURES IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND NO MATERIAL INCREASE IS EXPECTED IN

FISCAL YEAR 2003.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE

SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES AND

DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 102,000 EMPLOYEES. THE DECLINE OF

APPROXIMATELY 4,000 EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY FROM

SEPARATIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET

DUE TO INCREASED ENROLLMENT FROM THE CLAIROL ACQUISITION.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY OWNS AND OPERATES 36 MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES AND LEASES AND OPERATES 2 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THESE

FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN 21 DIFFERENT STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OWNS

AND OPERATES 89 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 44 OTHER COUNTRIES. FABRIC AND

HOME CARE PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AT 46 OF THESE LOCATIONS; BABY, FEMININE AND

FAMILY CARE PRODUCTS AT 42; HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 24; BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS AT

28; AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTS AT 12. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS

EFFICIENTLY AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AT OFF-SITE SUPERFUND

LOCATIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF INVESTIGATION. THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED AT THE END OF JUNE 30, 2002 REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS PROBABLE

FUTURE COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED WAS $5 MILLION.

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND WILL MAKE CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN

THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND

IN OTHER CONTEXTS RELATING TO VOLUME AND NET SALES GROWTH, INCREASES IN MARKET

SHARES, FINANCIAL GOALS AND COST REDUCTION, AMONG OTHERS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES

REGARDING COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, PRICING, PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, CURRENCY MOVEMENTS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTION

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN MARKETS. AMONG THE KEY FACTORS NECESSARY TO

ACHIEVE THE COMPANYS GOALS ARE: (1) THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF THE

COMPANYS NEW ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE, INCLUDING ACHIEVEMENT OF EXPECTED COST

AND TAX SAVINGS; (2) THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS PLANS, INCLUDING GROWING

VOLUME PROFITABLY, DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, ESPECIALLY WITH

RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS; (3) THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN KEY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS;

(4) THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GROWTH IN SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPING MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA,

TURKEY, MEXICO, THE SOUTHERN CONE OF LATIN AMERICA, THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL

AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA; (5) THE ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF

PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES; (6) THE SUCCESSFUL AND TIMELY

EXECUTION OF PLANNED BRAND DIVESTITURES; (7) THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY

IMPLEMENT, ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN COST IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN MANUFACTURING AND

OVERHEAD AREAS; (8) THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CURRENCY (INCLUDING

CURRENCY ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICA), INTEREST RATE AND CERTAIN COMMODITY COST

EXPOSURES; AND (9) THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CONTINUED POLITICAL AND/OR

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, AS WELL AS ANY

POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY DUE TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. IF THE

COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE INCORRECT OR DO NOT COME TO FRUITION,

OR IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF THESE KEY FACTORS, THEN THE COMPANYS

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

MADE HEREIN.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992

STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE

PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION). ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT

BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, THE PLAN IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS ON

OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN IS A STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND

MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS MAY BE

GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, MAY BE GRANTED STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, AND/OR MAY BE GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE

EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE AVERAGE

PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT

LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY

UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH,

AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH OF DEPARTURE, EXCEPT

IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN

MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS

EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE

SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER

& GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, MAY BE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF

THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS AND TO

STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS

SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE

PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE

NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION

SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS, RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO

ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT.

THESE OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS

FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR

SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH

EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS

GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. SINCE THE DATE OF THE FIRST GRANT, EACH NEW

EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES.
