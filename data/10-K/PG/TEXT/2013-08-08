PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE TO MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A); NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE TERMS THE "COMPANY," "P&G," "WE," "OUR" OR "US" AS USED HEREIN REFER TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE WORLD'S CONSUMERS.  THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN

180

COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND AMENDMENTS THERETO, ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC. THE SEC MAINTAINS AN INTERNET SITE THAT CONTAINS THESE REPORTS AT: WWW.SEC.GOV. YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS THESE REPORTS THROUGH LINKS FROM OUR WEBSITE AT: WWW.PG.COM/INVESTORS.

COPIES OF THESE REPORTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE, WITHOUT CHARGE, BY CONTACTING COMPUTERSHARE INC., 250 ROYALL STREET, CANTON, MA 02021.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE COMPANY HAS FIVE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP: BEAUTY; GROOMING; HEALTH CARE; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE; AND BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE.  MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR UNDERSTANDING THESE BUSINESSES ARE SIMILAR.  OPERATING MARGINS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES VARY DUE TO THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND DIFFERENCES IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  NET SALES GROWTH BY BUSINESS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS AND PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.  WHILE NONE OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE HIGHLY SEASONAL, COMPONENTS WITHIN CERTAIN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS BATTERIES (FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE), APPLIANCES (GROOMING) AND PRESTIGE FRAGRANCES (BEAUTY) ARE SEASONAL.  IN ADDITION, ANTICIPATION OR OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CAN DRIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH DEMAND FOR BATTERIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN MD&A AND NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL

.  OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF EXISTING BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS.  THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN MORE THAN

180

COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AROUND THE WORLD PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SALONS, E-COMMERCE AND HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES WHICH SERVE MANY CONSUMERS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS.  WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE PRESENCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE "FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTH" - WHEN A CONSUMER IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE.  WE MUST ALSO WIN THE "SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH" - WHEN A CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS AND DECIDES WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD VALUE.  WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BRANDING TO THE CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.  WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES

.  INFORMATION ON KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

KEY CUSTOMERS

.  OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES, HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, DISTRIBUTORS AND E-COMMERCE RETAILERS.  SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2013 AND 2012, AND 15% IN 2011.  NO OTHER CUSTOMER REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30%, 31% AND 32% OF OUR TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.  THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

.  ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHICH ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS.  WE PRODUCE CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  IN ADDITION, FUEL, NATURAL GAS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES CONSUMED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INPUT MATERIALS AND FINISHED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERS.  THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND

14

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

OTHER COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION.  WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS THE CHANGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY PURCHASES A SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF OTHER RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

.  WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACTIVITY IN ALL BUSINESSES.  SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS.  THE TRADEMARKS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE OVERALL MARKETING AND BRANDING OF OUR PRODUCTS.  ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS AND TRADEMARKS IN EACH BUSINESS ARE REGISTERED.  IN PART, OUR SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

COMPETITIVE CONDITION

.  THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST SIMILAR PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN GLOBAL COMPETITORS.  IN MANY OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER BRANDED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RETAILERS' PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDS.  WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OFTEN HOLDING A LEADERSHIP OR SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE POSITION.  WE SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO BUILD AWARENESS OF OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE.  WE BELIEVE THIS COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS.  PRODUCT QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ENABLE US TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND OBTAIN PATENTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR CONSUMERS.  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $2.0 BILLION IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011.

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

. EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2014.

EMPLOYEES

.  TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IS AN ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COMPANY EMPLOYEES EXCLUDING INTERNS, CO-OPS AND EMPLOYEES OF JOINT VENTURES.  THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING AND NON-MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES.  A DISCUSSION OF PROGRESS ON NON-MANUFACTURING ENROLLMENT OBJECTIVES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  HISTORICAL NUMBERS INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

RISK FACTORS.

WE DISCUSS OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS FORM 10-K, OTHER QUARTERLY REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.  ALL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” AND ARE BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA AND BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

15

TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY BECOME OUT OF DATE OR INCOMPLETE.  WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHER FACTORS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF “RISK FACTORS” IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MD&A AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED IN THIS REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE, BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS.  THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS.

A CHANGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR LACK OF MARKET GROWTH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS.  TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS.  WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY FOCUSING ON THE MOST PROFITABLE BUSINESSES, BIGGEST INNOVATIONS AND MOST IMPORTANT EMERGING MARKETS.  WE ALSO EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY ACHIEVING DISPROPORTIONATE GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS.  IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR MARKET GROWTH RATES IN EITHER DEVELOPED OR DEVELOPING MARKETS FALLS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OR OUR MARKET SHARE DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE BUSINESSES, OUR VOLUME, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR RESULTS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  THIS COULD OCCUR DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER TRENDS AND HABITS OR NEGATIVE CONSUMER RESPONSES TO PRICING ACTIONS.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN COMPETE WITH OUR LOCAL AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKETS AND CHANNELS.

THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL COMPETITORS.  AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS.  THIS INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASING COMPETITION FROM MID- AND LOWER-TIER VALUE PRODUCTS IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING MARKETS.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS.  IN ADDITION, THE EMERGENCE OF NEW SALES CHANNELS MAY AFFECT CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES, AS WELL AS MARKET DYNAMICS.  FAILURE TO

EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE NEW CHANNELS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS.

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR GROWTH TARGETS DEPENDS ON SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT, MARKETING AND OPERATIONS INNOVATION AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE INNOVATION.

ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS RESULTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT, INTRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF NEW PRODUCTS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CORRECTLY ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN NECESSARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS AND TO AVOID INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.  WE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES MADE BY COMPETITORS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS GRANTED TO COMPETITORS.  FAILURE TO DO SO COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST FLUCTUATIONS AND PRESSURES THAT COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW MATERIALS, LABOR COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, PENSION AND HEALTHCARE COSTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES.  THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS, COST SAVING PROJECTS AND SOURCING DECISIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING MARGINS AND MARKET SHARE.  IN ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS INCLUDE COST SAVINGS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNOUNCED PRODUCTIVITY PLAN.  FAILURE TO DELIVER THESE SAVINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

WE FACE RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY KEY SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING PLANT ARRANGEMENTS, TO ACHIEVE OUR COST TARGETS.  WHILE WE HAVE BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR KEY MANUFACTURING SITES AND THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, IT MAY BE IMPRACTICABLE TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT ALTERNATIVE SOURCE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE INPUT MATERIALS ARE IN LIMITED SUPPLY.  IN ADDITION, OUR STRATEGY FOR GLOBAL GROWTH INCLUDES INCREASED PRESENCE IN EMERGING MARKETS.  SOME EMERGING MARKETS HAVE GREATER POLITICAL VOLATILITY AND GREATER VULNERABILITY TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND LABOR DISRUPTIONS THAN ESTABLISHED MARKETS.  ANY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF MANUFACTURING, SUCH AS LABOR DISPUTES, LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT OF KEY MANUFACTURING SITES, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM AND OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL, COULD INTERRUPT PRODUCT SUPPLY AND, IF NOT REMEDIED, HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

16

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, WITH MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS OUTSIDE THE U.S.  OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.

•

COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. LAWS AFFECTING OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT;

•

COMPLIANCE WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL REGULATIONS AND LAWS;

•

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THOSE LAWS;

•

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LIMITS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM OVERSEAS;

•

DISCRIMINATORY OR CONFLICTING FISCAL POLICIES;

•

DIFFICULTIES ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS;

•

GREATER RISK OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND LONGER COLLECTION CYCLES;

•

EFFECTIVE AND IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTROL ENVIRONMENT PROCESSES ACROSS OUR DIVERSE OPERATIONS AND EMPLOYEE BASE; AND

•

IMPOSITION OF INCREASED OR NEW TARIFFS, QUOTAS, TRADE BARRIERS OR SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE HAVE SIZABLE BUSINESSES AND MAINTAIN LOCAL CURRENCY CASH BALANCES IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITH EXCHANGE, IMPORT AUTHORIZATION OR PRICING CONTROLS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, CHINA, INDIA AND EGYPT.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE AND OTHER RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN AN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT.

FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HOLD ASSETS AND INCUR LIABILITIES, EARN REVENUES AND PAY EXPENSES IN A VARIETY OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET REVENUE.  FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY THEREFORE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  SEE ALSO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY SECTIONS OF THE MD&A AND NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL AND POLITICAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.

OUR BUSINESS IS IMPACTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AROUND THE WORLD.  IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS RELATED TO: A SLOW-DOWN IN THE GENERAL

ECONOMY; SUPPLIER, VENDOR OR CUSTOMER DISRUPTIONS RESULTING FROM TIGHTER CREDIT MARKETS; AND/OR TEMPORARY INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT DAY-TO-DAY TRANSACTIONS THROUGH OUR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES INVOLVING THE PAYMENT TO OR COLLECTION OF FUNDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND SUPPLIERS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN CREDIT RATINGS THAT PROVIDE US WITH READY ACCESS TO GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  ANY DOWNGRADE OF OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS BY A CREDIT RATING AGENCY COULD INCREASE OUR FUTURE BORROWING COSTS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US.

WE COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY POLITICAL ISSUES OR CRISES IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN RISK RELATED TO A DEFAULT BY OR DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CONTINUED INSTABILITY IN THE BANKING AND GOVERNMENTAL SECTORS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THE DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEDERAL AND STATE DEBT AND BUDGET CHALLENGES IN THE UNITED STATES.

CONSEQUENTLY, OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIES, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION.  THESE RISKS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL LIQUIDITY AND FINANCING COSTS, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT RECEIPTS DUE FROM GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING REFUNDS OF VALUE ADDED TAXES, AND/OR CREATE SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISKS RELATIVE TO OUR LOCAL CUSTOMERS AND DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

IF THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY OR ONE OR MORE OF OUR BRANDS ERODES SIGNIFICANTLY, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER CONSTITUENCIES, SUCH AS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.  IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR BRANDS HAVE WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION.  THIS RECOGNITION IS THE RESULT OF THE LARGE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR PRODUCTS OVER MANY YEARS.  THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF OUR PRODUCTS IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS.  OUR COMPANY ALSO DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR REPUTATION, SUCH AS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE REAL OR PERCEIVED ISSUES, INCLUDING CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, QUALITY, EFFICACY OR SIMILAR MATTERS, THESE ISSUES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT SENTIMENTS TOWARD THE COMPANY OR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE FREELY COULD BE IMPAIRED AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER.  OUR FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRANDS AND THE SUCCESS OF THESE BRANDS CAN SUFFER IF OUR MARKETING PLANS OR PRODUCT INITIATIVES DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON A BRAND'S IMAGE OR ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS.  OUR RESULTS COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF ONE OF OUR BRANDS SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ITS REPUTATION DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT RECALL, PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION, ALLEGATIONS OF PRODUCT TAMPERING OR THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF COUNTERFEIT

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

17

PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, GIVEN THE ASSOCIATION OF OUR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WITH THE COMPANY, AN ISSUE WITH ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE REPUTATION OF OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, THEREBY POTENTIALLY HURTING RESULTS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ONGOING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

WE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A CEO TRANSITION, AS WELL AS OTHER SENIOR LEADERSHIP CHANGES, AND WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES.  WE EXPECT THESE TYPES OF CHANGES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE MANY STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES, TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THESE CHANGES, INCLUDING RETENTION OF PARTICULARLY KEY EMPLOYEES, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS.  FURTHER, ONGOING BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN MORE RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES FOR VARIOUS SERVICES AND THAT RELIANCE MAY INCREASE REPUTATIONAL, OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISK OF CORRUPTION.  WE ARE GENERALLY A BUILD-FROM-WITHIN COMPANY AND OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON IDENTIFYING, DEVELOPING AND RETAINING KEY EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE UNINTERRUPTED LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION FOR OUR BUSINESS.  THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING ORGANIZATION CAPABILITIES IN KEY GROWTH MARKETS WHERE THE DEPTH OF SKILLED OR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES MAY BE LIMITED AND COMPETITION FOR THESE RESOURCES IS INTENSE.  FINALLY, OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS ASSUME A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS, WHILE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN BUSINESS GROWTH, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ONGOING ACQUISITION, JOINT VENTURE AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITIES COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

AS A COMPANY THAT MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER BRANDS, OUR ONGOING BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ACQUISITION, JOINT VENTURE AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITIES.  WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DELIVERING AGAINST OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  SPECIFICALLY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF: 1) CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OR OTHER MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS CAUSE THE VALUE OF ACQUIRED ASSETS TO FALL BELOW BOOK VALUE, 2) WE ARE UNABLE TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACTS FROM THE LOSS OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH DIVESTED BRANDS, OR 3) WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES, WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  ADDITIONALLY, JOINT VENTURES INHERENTLY INVOLVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE FINANCIAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND/OR COMPLIANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH JOINT VENTURE.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT, AND OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND RESOLVE PENDING LEGAL MATTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND PENALTIES MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. AS A U.S. BASED MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAX REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MULTIPLE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE INTERDEPENDENT. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN INCOME THAT IS EARNED AND TAXED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS NOT TAXED IN THE UNITED STATES, PROVIDED THOSE EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IF THESE OR OTHER TAX REGULATIONS SHOULD CHANGE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE IMPACTED.

IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  FURTHERMORE, IF PENDING LEGAL MATTERS, INCLUDING THE COMPETITION LAW AND ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESULT IN FINES OR COSTS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED TO DATE, THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THERE ARE INCREASING CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FROM MEMBERS OF LEADERSHIP IN BOTH MAJOR U.S. POLITICAL PARTIES FOR “COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM” WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE INCOME TAX RULES THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO U.S. DOMICILED CORPORATIONS, SUCH AS P&G.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE OVERALL EFFECT OF SUCH POTENTIAL LEGISLATION WOULD BE CUMULATIVELY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE FOR OUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, BUT SUCH CHANGES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE SELL MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS VIA RETAIL CUSTOMERS, WHICH CONSIST OF MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES, HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, DISTRIBUTORS AND E-COMMERCE RETAILERS.  OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS.  THIS INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRADE TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS.  OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT WITH A KEY CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR TRADE TERMS AND PRINCIPLES.  OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF A KEY CUSTOMER WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE INVENTORY LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCTS OR EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS DISRUPTION.

CONSOLIDATION AMONG OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS COULD ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST AND MARGIN PRESSURE AND LEAD TO MORE COMPLEXITY ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES FOR BOTH US

18

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

AND OUR KEY RETAILERS. THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IF MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE ADDRESSING LOCAL TRADE PRESSURES, LOCAL LAW AND REGULATION CHANGES OR FINANCIAL DISTRESS.

A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, PROCESSES, ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR REPUTATION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

CERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN PURELY HISTORICAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, STATEMENTS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS PLANS, OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS AND THE ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THOSE STATEMENTS ARE BASED, ARE “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY APPEAR THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: “MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS” AND “RISK FACTORS.” THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS GENERALLY ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE WORDS “BELIEVE,” “PROJECT,” “EXPECT,” “ANTICIPATE,” “ESTIMATE,” “INTEND,” “STRATEGY,” “FUTURE,” “OPPORTUNITY,” “PLAN,” “MAY,” “SHOULD,” “WILL,” “WOULD,” “WILL BE,” “WILL CONTINUE,” “WILL LIKELY RESULT” AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS AND EVENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE SECTION TITLED "ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS" AND THE SECTION TITLED “RISK FACTORS” (ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE PUBLICLY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER BECAUSE OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF P&G'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS BY FOCUSING ON CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY MEASURES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  MD&A IS ORGANIZED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.

OTHER INFORMATION

THROUGHOUT MD&A, WE REFER TO MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING UNIT VOLUME GROWTH, NET SALES AND NET EARNINGS.  WE ALSO REFER TO A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED UNDER

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), INCLUDING ORGANIC SALES GROWTH, CORE EARNINGS PER SHARE (CORE EPS), FREE CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY.  ORGANIC SALES GROWTH IS NET SALES GROWTH EXCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES.  CORE EPS IS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS EXCLUDING CERTAIN SPECIFIED CHARGES AND GAINS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS OPERATING CASH FLOW LESS CAPITAL SPENDING.  FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY IS THE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO NET EARNINGS.  WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE OUR INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNDERLYING RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS WELL AS INSIGHT TO SOME OF THE METRICS USED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT.  THE EXPLANATION AT THE END OF MD&A PROVIDES MORE DETAILS ON THE USE AND DERIVATION OF THESE MEASURES.

MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CERTAIN MARKET SHARE AND MARKET CONSUMPTION ESTIMATES TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITION DESPITE SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND COMPARABILITY OF SHARE AND CONSUMPTION INFORMATION. REFERENCES TO MARKET SHARE AND MARKET CONSUMPTION IN MD&A ARE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF VENDOR-REPORTED CONSUMPTION AND MARKET SIZE DATA, AS WELL AS INTERNAL ESTIMATES.  ALL MARKET SHARE REFERENCES REPRESENT THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN DOLLAR TERMS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS OF OUR PRODUCTS, RELATIVE TO ALL PRODUCT SALES IN THE CATEGORY AND ARE MEASURED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS VERSUS THE PRIOR 12 MONTH PERIOD.  REFERENCES TO COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY INCLUDE PROMOTIONAL AND PRODUCT INITIATIVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

OVERVIEW

P&G IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN RETAIL GOODS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO OUR CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SALONS AND HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING PERFUMERIES, PHARMACIES AND E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE ON-THE-GROUND OPERATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY

OUR MARKET ENVIRONMENT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL COMPETITORS.  IN MANY OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER BRANDED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RETAILERS' PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDS.  ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THE PRODUCT SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY PRICE TIERS (REFERRED TO AS SUPER-PREMIUM, PREMIUM, MID-TIER AND VALUE-TIER PRODUCTS).  WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OFTEN HOLDING A LEADERSHIP OR SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE POSITION.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 CHANGES TO GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT STRUCTURE

WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO OUR GBU STRUCTURE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

AS A RESULT, FEMININE CARE WILL TRANSITION FROM HEALTH CARE TO GLOBAL BABY, FEMININE AND FAMILY CARE.  ADDITIONALLY, PET CARE WILL TRANSITION FROM FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE TO GLOBAL HEALTH.

THESE CHANGES WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR SEGMENT REPORTING BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, AT WHICH TIME OUR HISTORICAL SEGMENT REPORTING WILL ALSO BE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE NEW STRUCTURE.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS

WE DISCUSS EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES, IN ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.  ALL SUCH STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" AND ARE BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA AND OUR BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY BECOME OUT-OF-DATE OR INCOMPLETE.  WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHER FACTORS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS, REFER TO ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS IN THIS 10-K.

ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS PLANS

.  WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS.  TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS AND RETAIL

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

27

TRADE CUSTOMERS.  OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS, ON THE CONTINUED POSITIVE REPUTATIONS OF OUR BRANDS AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN TRADEMARK PROTECTION.  THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, AND RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS GRANTED TO COMPETITION. OUR SUCCESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON EFFECTIVE SALES, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND EXECUTE IN THESE AREAS WILL DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO GROW EXISTING NET SALES AND VOLUME PROFITABLY, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS (INCLUDING DEVELOPING MARKETS) IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO FOCUS.  THERE ARE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES, TRADE TERMS AND PRODUCT INITIATIVES.  WE MUST MANAGE EACH OF THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS MAINTAIN MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMERS, IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE AND ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS PLANS.

AS A COMPANY THAT MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER BRANDS, OUR ONGOING BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ONGOING ACQUISITION, DIVESTITURE AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITIES. WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DELIVERING AGAINST BASE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

DAILY CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING SYSTEMS OPERATED BY THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND TO MAINTAIN SECURITY OVER OUR DATA.

COST PRESSURES

.  OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW MATERIALS, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS, COST SAVINGS PROJECTS, SOURCING DECISIONS AND CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS CONSISTENT PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.  WE ALSO MUST MANAGE OUR DEBT AND CURRENCY EXPOSURE, ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITH CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, SUCH AS VENEZUELA, CHINA, INDIA, EGYPT AND ARGENTINA.  WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND MANUFACTURING PLANT ARRANGEMENTS, AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ANY DISRUPTIONS AT COMPANY MANUFACTURING SITES.  WE MUST IMPLEMENT, ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN COST IMPROVEMENT PLANS, INCLUDING OUR OUTSOURCING PROJECTS AND THOSE RELATED TO GENERAL OVERHEAD AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION.  SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THESE CHANGES, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING, DEVELOPING AND RETAINING KEY EMPLOYEES, IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

.  DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS HAS A CORRELATION TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS.  THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC FACTORS REMAIN DYNAMIC.  ECONOMIC CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, POLITICAL UNREST AND NATURAL DISASTERS MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INFLATION,

DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, DUE TO TERRORIST AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTIVITIES OR NATURAL DISASTERS.  WE COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A GLOBAL, REGIONAL OR NATIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN RISK IN THE EVENT OF A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF, OR A DEFAULT BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, RESULTING IN A DISRUPTION OF CREDIT MARKETS.  SUCH EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT RECEIPTS DUE FROM GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING REFUNDS OF VALUE ADDED TAXES, CREATE SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISKS RELATIVE TO OUR LOCAL CUSTOMERS AND DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND/OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL LIQUIDITY.  ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LIMITS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM OVERSEAS.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

.  CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS.  THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAX LAWS OR THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE KEY METRICS INCLUDED IN OUR DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDE NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A), OTHER NON-OPERATING ITEMS AND INCOME TAXES.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS DRIVING YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN NET SALES INCLUDE OVERALL MARKET GROWTH IN THE CATEGORIES IN WHICH WE COMPETE, PRODUCT INITIATIVES, GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION AND ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY, ALL OF WHICH DRIVE CHANGES IN OUR UNDERLYING UNIT VOLUME, AS WELL AS PRICING ACTIONS (WHICH CAN ALSO INDIRECTLY IMPACT VOLUME), CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS ON SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S.

MOST OF OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND SG&A ARE TO SOME EXTENT VARIABLE IN NATURE.  ACCORDINGLY, OUR DISCUSSION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON RELATIVE MARGINS RATHER THAN THE ABSOLUTE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN TOTAL COSTS.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF CHANGES IN GROSS MARGIN ARE INPUT COSTS (ENERGY AND OTHER COMMODITIES), PRICING IMPACTS, PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX (FOR EXAMPLE, GROSS MARGINS IN DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN IN DEVELOPING MARKETS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS), THE IMPACTS OF MANUFACTURING SAVINGS PROJECTS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SCALE IMPACTS (FOR COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR LESS VARIABLE IN NATURE).  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF SG&A ARE MARKETING-RELATED COSTS AND OVERHEAD COSTS.  MARKETING-RELATED COSTS ARE PRIMARILY VARIABLE IN NATURE, ALTHOUGH WE DO ACHIEVE SOME LEVEL OF SCALE BENEFIT OVER TIME DUE TO OVERALL GROWTH AND OTHER MARKETING EFFICIENCIES.  OVERHEAD COSTS ARE ALSO VARIABLE IN NATURE, BUT ON A RELATIVE BASIS, LESS SO THAN MARKETING COSTS DUE TO OUR

28

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR ORGANIZATION AND SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH.  ACCORDINGLY, WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE SCALE-RELATED IMPACTS FOR THESE COSTS.

IN FEBRUARY AND NOVEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY MADE ANNOUNCEMENTS RELATED TO A PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN TO REDUCE COSTS IN THE AREAS OF SUPPLY CHAIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE COST REDUCTIONS BY STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING, MANUFACTURING AND OTHER WORK PROCESSES IN ORDER TO HELP FUND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR IN EXCESS OF

$3.5 BILLION

IN BEFORE-TAX RESTRUCTURING COSTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (FISCAL 2012 THROUGH FISCAL 2016) AS PART OF THIS PLAN.  OVERALL, THE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO DELIVER IN EXCESS OF $2.0 BILLION IN BEFORE-TAX ANNUAL SAVINGS.

NET SALES

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

NET SALES INCREASED 1% TO $84.2 BILLION IN 2013 ON A 2% INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME.  VOLUME IN BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE GREW MID-SINGLE DIGITS.  VOLUME IN FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE AND IN HEALTH CARE GREW LOW SINGLE DIGITS.  BEAUTY VOLUME WAS IN LINE WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  GROOMING VOLUME DECREASED LOW SINGLE DIGITS.  VOLUME GREW LOW SINGLE DIGITS IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING REGIONS.  THE IMPACT OF OVERALL GLOBAL MARKET GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET SHARE DECLINES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES.  PRICE INCREASES ADDED 1% TO NET SALES, DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY EXECUTED IN PRIOR

PERIODS TO OFFSET COST INCREASES AND DEVALUING DEVELOPING MARKET CURRENCIES.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE REDUCED NET SALES BY 2%.  ORGANIC SALES GROWTH WAS 3% DRIVEN BY BOTH VOLUME AND PRICE INCREASES.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

NET SALES INCREASED 3% TO $83.7 BILLION IN 2012 ON UNIT VOLUME THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  DIFFICULT MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAUSED A SLOWDOWN IN MARKET GROWTH IN FISCAL 2012, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPED MARKETS.  IN ADDITION, WE INITIATED A NUMBER OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT IN FISCAL 2012, IN LARGE PART TO RECOVER THE RISING COST OF COMMODITIES AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS.  THESE FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED VOLUME GROWTH IN 2012, BUT THE PRICE INCREASES LED TO HIGHER OVERALL SALES.  VOLUME GREW LOW SINGLE DIGITS IN BEAUTY, GROOMING, HEALTH CARE, AND BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE.  FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE VOLUME DECREASED LOW SINGLE DIGITS.  VOLUME GREW MID-SINGLE DIGITS IN DEVELOPING REGIONS AND WAS DOWN LOW SINGLE DIGITS IN DEVELOPED REGIONS.  THE IMPACT OF OVERALL GLOBAL MARKET GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET SHARE DECLINES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES.  PRICE INCREASES ADDED 4% TO NET SALES, DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND REGIONS, PRIMARILY TO HELP OFFSET COMMODITY COSTS AND DEVALUING CURRENCIES IN CERTAIN DEVELOPING MARKETS.  MIX REDUCED NET SALES BY 1% DUE TO UNFAVORABLE GEOGRAPHIC MIX ACROSS THE BEAUTY, GROOMING, HEALTH CARE AND FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE WAS NEUTRAL TO NET SALES.  ORGANIC SALES GROWTH WAS 3% DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES.

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

GROSS MARGIN EXPANDED 30 BASIS POINTS IN 2013 TO 49.6% OF NET SALES, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRICING AND MANUFACTURING COST SAVINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEGATIVE MIX AND HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.  GROSS MARGIN WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY 70 BASIS POINTS FROM HIGHER PRICING AND APPROXIMATELY 160 BASIS POINTS FROM MANUFACTURING COST SAVINGS.  GROSS MARGIN WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 160 BASIS POINTS FROM NEGATIVE GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX BEHIND DISPROPORTIONATE GROWTH

IN DEVELOPING REGIONS AND MID-TIER PRODUCTS, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANY AVERAGE.  GROSS MARGIN WAS ALSO REDUCED BY CAPACITY INVESTMENTS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS AND HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.

TOTAL SG&A INCREASED 2% TO $27.0 BILLION IN 2013, DRIVEN BY A CHARGE FOR THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT FROM THE DEVALUATION OF THE OFFICIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE IN VENEZUELA AND AN INCREASE IN MARKETING SPENDING, PARTIALLY

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

29

OFFSET BY REDUCED OVERHEAD COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN.  SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 32.0% LARGELY DUE TO A 40 BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM THE VENEZUELA DEVALUATION CHARGE AND A 10 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN MARKETING SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  OVERHEAD COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECLINED 20 BASIS POINTS, AS A 70-BASIS POINT BENEFIT FROM OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN AND 20 BASIS POINTS OF LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  THIS WAS DUE TO A HIGHER PORTION OF SG&A SPENDING IN STRENGTHENING CURRENCIES AS COMPARED TO NET SALES, HIGHER EMPLOYEE WAGES AND BENEFIT COSTS AND INCREASED MERCHANDISING INVESTMENTS.

IN FISCAL 2013 WE INCURRED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $308 MILLION ($290 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL IN OUR APPLIANCES BUSINESS AND THE RELATED BRAUN TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSET.  IN FISCAL 2012 WE INCURRED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.6 BILLION ($1.5 BILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO THE CARRYING VALUES OF GOODWILL IN OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES AND OUR KOLESTON PERFECT AND WELLA INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS.  SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILS, INCLUDING FACTORS LEADING TO THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  SINCE GOODWILL IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT AND SEGMENT REPORTING, THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT.  THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT FOR MANAGEMENT AND SEGMENT REPORTING.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

GROSS MARGIN CONTRACTED 160 BASIS POINTS IN 2012 TO 49.3% OF NET SALES.  THE REDUCTION IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY A 230-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM HIGHER COMMODITY AND ENERGY COSTS.  GROSS MARGIN WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 200 BASIS POINTS FROM NEGATIVE GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX AND BY 30 BASIS POINTS FROM THE IMPACT OF INCREASED RESTRUCTURING SPENDING DUE TO THE PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN.  THE NEGATIVE MIX RESULTED FROM DISPROPORTIONATE GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS, AS DEVELOPING REGIONS HAVE LOWER RELATIVE GROSS MARGINS THAN DEVELOPED REGIONS.  THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 200-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM INCREASED PRICING AND A 140-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM MANUFACTURING COST SAVINGS.

TOTAL SG&A INCREASED 3% TO $26.4 BILLION IN 2012, DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING TO SUPPORT INITIATIVE ACTIVITY AND A $510 MILLION INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING SPENDING FROM OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN COMPETITION LAW FINES (SEE ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 11 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH WERE $303 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $75 MILLION IN 2012.  SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED 30 BASIS POINTS TO 31.5%, AS REDUCED COMPETITION LAW FINES AND THE IMPACT OF INCREASED SCALE LEVERAGE ON MARKETING AND OVERHEAD COSTS FROM HIGHER SALES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 60 BASIS POINTS OF INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS.

NON-OPERATING ITEMS

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED 13% IN 2013 TO $667 MILLION, DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT.  INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 13% IN 2013 TO $87 MILLION, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES DIVESTITURE GAINS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $757 MILLION TO $942 MILLION IN 2013 MAINLY DUE TO NET ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITIES.  A HOLDING GAIN OF $631 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF P&G'S BABY CARE AND FEMININE CARE JOINT VENTURE IN IBERIA AND A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OUR ITALIAN BLEACH BUSINESS, BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $130 MILLION DIVESTITURE GAIN FROM THE PUR WATER FILTRATION BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

IN 2012, INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED 7% TO $769 MILLION, DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND A DECREASE IN AVERAGE DEBT OUTSTANDING.  INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 24% IN 2012 TO $77 MILLION, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET DECREASED $86 MILLION TO $185 MILLION IN 2012 MAINLY BEHIND THE IMPACT OF MINOR BRAND DIVESTITURES.  A DIVESTITURE GAIN FROM THE SALE OF THE PUR WATER FILTRATION BRAND IN FISCAL 2012 WAS LESS THAN THE ZEST AND INFASIL DIVESTITURE GAINS IN FISCAL 2011.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED 390 BASIS POINTS TO 23.2% IN 2013.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS RATE DECLINE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

•

APPROXIMATELY 210 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE HIGHER IN THE BASE PERIOD VERSUS THE CURRENT YEAR.

•

APPROXIMATELY 100 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE TAX IMPACTS FROM ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY (PRIMARILY THE NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF THE BABY CARE AND FEMININE CARE JOINT VENTURE IN IBERIA).

•

APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS DUE TO THE NET IMPACT OF FAVORABLE DISCRETE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS.  THE CURRENT YEAR NET BENEFIT WAS $275, OR 180 BASIS POINTS, VERSUS A NET BENEFIT OF 130 BASIS POINTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

•

APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE VENEZUELA CURRENCY DEVALUATION.

30

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

IN 2012, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED 510 BASIS POINTS TO 27.1% PRIMARILY DUE TO A 250-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2012 AND THE NET IMPACT OF FAVORABLE DISCRETE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS, WHICH DROVE 250 BASIS POINTS OF THE TAX RATE DIFFERENCE.  THE NET BENEFIT FROM FAVORABLE DISCRETE ADJUSTMENTS WAS $165 MILLION IN FISCAL 2012, WHICH NETTED TO 130 BASIS POINTS, VERSUS 380 BASIS POINTS OF NET BENEFITS IN FISCAL 2011.

NET EARNINGS

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.1 BILLION OR 22% TO $11.4 BILLION IN 2013.  THE COMBINATION OF THE NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE GAINS AND THE NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DROVE $1.9 BILLION OF THE INCREASE.  EARNINGS ALSO INCREASED DUE TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND THE 30-BASIS POINT GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DECREASED $1.6 BILLION IN 2013 DUE TO THE GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS AND THE EARNINGS FROM THE SNACKS BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE DIVESTITURE IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE INCREASED $556 MILLION, OR 5% TO $11.3 BILLION.

DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED 24% TO $3.86 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS AND A REDUCTION IN SHARES OUTSTANDING.  THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DECREASED DUE TO $6.0 BILLION OF TREASURY SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SHARES ISSUED UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS.  DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $0.54 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD (ZERO IN THE CURRENT PERIOD) DUE TO THE GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS AND EARNINGS OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE DIVESTITURE.  DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 5% TO $3.86.

CORE EPS INCREASED 5% TO $4.05 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION AND THE REDUCTION IN SHARES OUTSTANDING.  CORE EPS REPRESENTS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS EXCLUDING THE CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE FOR THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT FROM THE DEVALUATION OF THE OFFICIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE IN VENEZUELA, THE CURRENT YEAR HOLDING GAIN ON THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF OUR IBERIAN JOINT VENTURE AND CHARGES IN BOTH YEARS FOR EUROPEAN LEGAL MATTERS, INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN AND IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

IN 2012, NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED 20% TO $9.3 BILLION AS AN INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS MORE THAN

OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES.  OPERATING MARGIN DECLINED 320 BASIS POINTS DUE PRIMARILY TO A 190-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES AND AN 85-BASIS POINT IMPACT FROM INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  THE IMPACT OF HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND NEGATIVE PRODUCT MIX WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICING, MANUFACTURING COST SAVINGS AND INCREASED SCALE LEVERAGE.

NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.4 BILLION IN 2012 DUE TO THE GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS.  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE DECLINED 9% TO $10.8 BILLION.

DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DECREASED 19% IN 2012 TO $3.12 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN NET EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN SHARES OUTSTANDING.  THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING WAS DRIVEN BY TREASURY SHARE REPURCHASES OF $4.0 BILLION, WHICH WERE MADE UNDER OUR PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SHARES ISSUED UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS.  DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCREASED $0.46 DUE TO THE GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE EARNINGS OF THE SNACKS BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE DIVESTITURE.  DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 7% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR TO $3.66 IN FISCAL 2012.  CORE EPS IN 2012 DECREASED 1% TO $3.85.

VENEZUELA CURRENCY IMPACTS

VENEZUELA IS A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY UNDER U.S. GAAP.  AS A RESULT, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN VENEZUELA.  ANY CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD BY THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS.

THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED ONE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE FOR QUALIFYING DIVIDENDS AND IMPORTED GOODS AND SERVICES.  THAT RATE WAS EQUAL TO 4.3 BOLIVARES FUERTES (VEF) TO ONE U.S. DOLLAR THROUGH FEBRUARY 12, 2013.  EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 13, 2013, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DEVALUED ITS CURRENCY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR FROM 4.3 TO 6.3 (OFFICIAL RATE).  THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR BALANCE SHEETS IN 2013 TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE DEVALUATION RESULTED IN A NET AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $236 MILLION ($0.08 PER SHARE).  THERE WILL ALSO BE AN ONGOING IMPACT RELATED TO TRANSLATING OUR INCOME STATEMENT AT THE NEW EXCHANGE RATES.  MOVING FROM THE 4.3 RATE TO THE 6.3 RATE WILL REDUCE FUTURE TOTAL COMPANY REPORTED NET SALES BY LESS THAN 1% ON A GOING BASIS.  THIS DOES NOT IMPACT OUR ORGANIC SALES GROWTH RATE, WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES.  VERSUS OUR EXISTING BUSINESS PLANS, THE EXCHANGE RATE CHANGE REDUCED OUR REPORTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04 PER SHARE IN 2013.

TRANSACTIONS AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE ARE SUBJECT TO CADIVI (VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMISSION).  OUR OVERALL RESULTS IN VENEZUELA ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE RATE EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE TO DIVIDEND REPATRIATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, THERE HAD BEEN A PARALLEL EXCHANGE MARKET (SITME) THAT WAS CONTROLLED BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF VENEZUELA AS THE ONLY LEGAL INTERMEDIARY TO EXECUTE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE OF CADIVI.  THE PUBLISHED RATE WAS 5.3 THROUGH FEBRUARY 12, 2013.  THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS THAT RAN THROUGH THIS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FOR NONESSENTIAL GOODS WAS RESTRICTIVE, WHICH FOR US ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ANY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE OTHER THAN THE OFFICIAL CADIVI  RATE TO PAY FOR IMPORTED GOODS AND/OR MANAGE OUR LOCAL MONETARY ASSET BALANCES.  WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DEVALUED ITS CURRENCY IN FEBRUARY, 2013, IT ALSO ELIMINATED SITME, BUT ESTABLISHED A NEW EXCHANGE RATE MARKET PROGRAM, REFERRED TO AS SICAD.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THERE IS LITTLE OFFICIAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE NEW AUCTION PROCESS OR THE UNDERLYING AUCTION RATES.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, WE HAD NET MONETARY ASSETS DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCY OF $913 MILLION.  LOCAL CURRENCY BALANCES DECREASED 14% SINCE JUNE 30, 2012 DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE FEBRUARY 2013 DEVALUATION AND AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS BY THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH CADIVI, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE NET AMOUNT OF INDIRECT VALUE ADDED TAXES (VAT) RECEIVABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM GOODS RECEIPTS AND SHIPMENTS.  PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY 2013 DEVALUATION, A PORTION OF OUR NET MONETARY ASSETS DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS REMEASURED USING THE SITME RATE BECAUSE WE PLANNED TO USE THAT AMOUNT OF THE NET ASSETS (LARGELY CASH) TO SATISFY U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED LIABILITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR OFFICIAL RATE DOLLARS.   THE REMAINING NET MONETARY ASSET BALANCES HAD BEEN REFLECTED WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THE 4.3 OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE.   HOWEVER, AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, THE PARALLEL SITME MARKET WAS ELIMINATED AT THE TIME OF THE FEBRUARY 2013 DEVALUATION, AND THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE SICAD MECHANISM.  ACCORDINGLY, ALL OF OUR NET MONETARY ASSETS ARE MEASURED AT THE OFFICIAL 6.3 EXCHANGE RATE AT JUNE 30, 2013.

ADDITIONALLY, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT ENACTED A PRICE CONTROL LAW DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2012 THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE NET SELLING PRICES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS SOLD IN VENEZUELA.

DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE TRANSPARENCY AND LIQUIDITY OF THE SICAD MARKET, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY REMEASURE A

PORTION OF OUR NET MONETARY BALANCES (THE AMOUNT OF THE NET ASSETS NEEDED TO SATISFY U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED LIABILITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR OFFICIAL RATE DOLLARS, APPROXIMATELY $240 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013) AT THE SICAD RATE.  THIS WOULD RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL DEVALUATION CHARGE.  OVER TIME, WE INTEND TO RESTORE NET SALES AND PROFIT TO LEVELS ACHIEVED PRIOR TO THE DEVALUATION. HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO DO SO WILL BE IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS.  THESE INCLUDE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED PRICE CONTROLS, ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE DEVALUATION, ANY FURTHER VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT PRICE OR EXCHANGE CONTROLS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND UTILITIES.  IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. DOLLARS AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, OUR LOCAL U.S. DOLLAR NEEDS, OUR OVERALL REPATRIATION PLANS, THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE LOCAL DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER CREDITORS AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AND THE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING VAT RECEIVABLE, WE MAY HAVE EXPOSURE FOR OUR LOCAL MONETARY ASSETS.  WE ALSO HAVE DEVALUATION EXPOSURE FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATES.

SEGMENT RESULTS

SEGMENT RESULTS REFLECT INFORMATION ON THE SAME BASIS WE USE FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.  THE RESULTS OF THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN NON-BUSINESS UNIT SPECIFIC COSTS SUCH AS INTEREST EXPENSE, INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND CERTAIN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT COSTS.  THESE COSTS ARE REPORTED IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT AND ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT DISCUSSION.  ADDITIONALLY, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN COMPANIES OVER WHICH WE EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DECISIONS AND, THEREFORE, DO NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE COMPANIES FOR U.S. GAAP PURPOSES ("UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES").  GIVEN THAT CERTAIN OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MANAGED AS INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THEY WERE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES FOR MANAGEMENT AND SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.  THIS MEANS PRE-TAX EARNINGS IN THE BUSINESS UNITS INCLUDE 100% OF EACH PRE-TAX INCOME STATEMENT COMPONENT.  IN DETERMINING AFTER-TAX EARNINGS IN THE BUSINESS UNITS, WE ELIMINATE THE SHARE OF EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST, AND APPLY THE STATUTORY TAX RATES.  ELIMINATIONS TO ADJUST EACH LINE ITEM TO U.S. GAAP ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT.  ALL REFERENCES TO NET EARNINGS THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT RESULTS REFER TO NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

GLOBAL MARKET SHARE OF THE HAIR CARE AND COLOR CATEGORY WAS DOWN MORE THAN HALF A POINT.  VOLUME IN BEAUTY CARE WAS IN LINE WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  A LOW

SINGLE-DIGIT VOLUME INCREASE IN PERSONAL CLEANSING AND A MID-SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN DEODORANTS, DRIVEN BY INNOVATION AND MARKET GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS, WAS OFFSET BY A MID-SINGLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN FACIAL SKIN CARE, WHERE GLOBAL MARKET SHARE DECREASED ABOUT A POINT.

NET EARNINGS MARGIN INCREASED MAINLY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER GROSS MARGIN.  THE REDUCTION IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICING.  SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED DUE TO SCALE LEVERAGE FROM INCREASED SALES.

CORPORATE INCLUDES CERTAIN OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING ACTIVITIES NOT ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC BUSINESS UNITS.  THESE INCLUDE: THE INCIDENTAL BUSINESSES MANAGED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL; FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES; OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE ITEMS; THE HISTORICAL RESULTS OF CERTAIN DIVESTED BRANDS AND CATEGORIES; CERTAIN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; AND CERTAIN RESTRUCTURING-TYPE ACTIVITIES TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION.  CORPORATE ALSO INCLUDES RECONCILING ITEMS TO ADJUST THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE SEGMENTS TO U.S. GAAP.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RECONCILING ITEMS INCLUDE INCOME TAXES (TO ADJUST FROM STATUTORY RATES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE SEGMENTS TO THE OVERALL COMPANY EFFECTIVE TAX RATE), ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES (TO ELIMINATE NET SALES, COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND SG&A FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE SEGMENTS BUT ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD FOR U.S. GAAP) AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST ADJUSTMENTS FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE 100% OWNERSHIP.  SINCE CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND LESS THAN 100%-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES ARE MANAGED AS INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE RELATED SEGMENTS, THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY FOR MANAGEMENT AND SEGMENT PURPOSES.  THIS MEANS OUR SEGMENT RESULTS RECOGNIZE 100% OF EACH INCOME STATEMENT COMPONENT THROUGH BEFORE-TAX EARNINGS IN THE SEGMENTS, WITH ELIMINATIONS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CORPORATE.  IN DETERMINING SEGMENT NET EARNINGS, WE APPLY THE STATUTORY TAX RATES (WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN CORPORATE) AND ELIMINATE THE SHARE OF EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST.

CORPORATE NET SALES PRIMARILY REFLECT THE ADJUSTMENT TO ELIMINATE THE SALES OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES INCLUDED IN BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS.  ACCORDINGLY, CORPORATE NET SALES ARE GENERALLY NEGATIVE.  NEGATIVE NET SALES IN CORPORATE FOR 2013 DECREASED BY $250 MILLION DUE TO 1) THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF OUR IBERIAN JOINT VENTURE (AFTER WHICH THIS BUSINESS IS CONSOLIDATED FOR BOTH SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS AND THE UNDERLYING SALES NO LONGER NEED TO BE ELIMINATED) AND 2) SMALLER ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE REDUCED SALES OF THE REMAINING UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.  CORPORATE NET EARNINGS IMPROVED $1.6 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED NET AFTER-TAX GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (WHICH TOTALED $1.5 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS COMPARED TO $290 MILLION IN THE CURRENT PERIOD), ALONG WITH THE CURRENT YEAR NET AFTER-TAX HOLDING GAIN RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF OUR IBERIAN JOINT VENTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CURRENT YEAR CHARGE FOR THE IMPACT OF THE VENEZUELA DEVALUATION.  ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE ITEMS IMPACTING NET EARNINGS IN CORPORATE ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION.

IN 2012, NEGATIVE NET SALES IN CORPORATE DECREASED BY $108 MILLION DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE LOWER NET SALES OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.  CORPORATE NET EARNINGS DECLINED $2.2 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET AFTER TAX GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1.5 BILLION, INCREMENTAL AFTER-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $587 MILLION AND THE IMPACT OF LOWER NET DISCRETE TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN 2012.  ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE ITEMS IMPACTING NET EARNINGS IN CORPORATE ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ABOVE.

PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN

IN FEBRUARY AND NOVEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY MADE ANNOUNCEMENTS RELATED TO A PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN TO REDUCE COSTS AND BETTER LEVERAGE SCALE IN THE AREAS OF SUPPLY CHAIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND OVERHEADS.   THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE COST REDUCTIONS BY STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING, MANUFACTURING AND OTHER WORK PROCESSES TO FUND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY.

AS PART OF THIS PLAN, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR IN EXCESS OF $3.5 BILLION IN BEFORE-TAX RESTRUCTURING COSTS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (FROM FISCAL 2012 THROUGH FISCAL 2016). APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THE COSTS HAVE BEEN INCURRED THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL 2013.  SAVINGS GENERATED FROM THE RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE, GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE ACTIVITIES, THE COROLLARY BENEFITS ACHIEVED, THE TIMING OF THE EXECUTION AND THE DEGREE OF REINVESTMENT.  OVERALL, THE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO DELIVER IN EXCESS OF $2 BILLION IN BEFORE-TAX ANNUAL SAVINGS.  THE CUMULATIVE BEFORE-TAX SAVINGS REALIZED AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING COSTS INCURRED THROUGH 2013 WERE APPROXIMATELY $940 MILLION.

RESTRUCTURING ACCRUALS OF $323 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES.  APPROXIMATELY 86% OF THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES INCURRED DURING FISCAL 2013 EITHER HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE SETTLED WITH CASH.  CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL POLICIES FOR ONGOING RESTRUCTURING-TYPE ACTIVITIES, THE RESULTING CHARGES ARE FUNDED BY AND INCLUDED WITHIN CORPORATE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING.

CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

WE BELIEVE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION CONTINUES TO BE OF HIGH QUALITY, AS EVIDENCED BY OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND READY ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AT COMPETITIVE RATES.

OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDES THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH TO FUND OPERATING NEEDS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  EXCESS OPERATING CASH IS USED FIRST TO FUND SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS. OTHER DISCRETIONARY USES INCLUDE SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS TO COMPLEMENT OUR PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES, BRANDS AND GEOGRAPHIES.  AS NECESSARY, WE MAY SUPPLEMENT OPERATING CASH FLOW WITH DEBT TO FUND THESE ACTIVITIES.  THE OVERALL CASH POSITION OF THE COMPANY REFLECTS OUR STRONG BUSINESS RESULTS AND A GLOBAL CASH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT, ECONOMIC FACTORS AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

OPERATING CASH FLOW

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS $14.9 BILLION IN 2013, A 12% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS (DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND GAINS ON SALE AND PURCHASE OF BUSINESSES) AND A DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE USED $415 MILLION OF CASH PRIMARILY TO FUND GROWTH.  IN ADDITION, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING INCREASED TWO DAYS DUE TO THE TIMING AND MIX OF SALES LATE IN THE PERIOD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS.  INCREASED INVENTORY USED $225 MILLION OF CASH TO SUPPORT PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND TO BUILD STOCK TO SUPPORT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS AND MANUFACTURING SOURCING CHANGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS.  INVENTORY DAYS ON HAND INCREASED BY ONE DAY PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS.  INCREASED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES GENERATED $1.3 BILLION OF CASH PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MARKETING ACCRUALS FROM INCREASED ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING COSTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS $13.3 BILLION IN 2012, IN LINE WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS (DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WORKING CAPITAL INCREASES.  INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE USED $427 MILLION OF CASH TO FUND GROWTH.  HOWEVER, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING WERE DOWN TWO DAYS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  INVENTORY GENERATED $77 MILLION OF CASH, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVENTORY TO SUPPORT PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND TO BUILD STOCK TO SUPPORT CAPACITY

EXPANSIONS AND MANUFACTURING SOURCING CHANGES.  INVENTORY DAYS ON HAND DECLINED BY 10 DAYS PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES USED $22 MILLION OF CASH, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PAYMENT OF FINES RELATED TO VIOLATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAWS.  CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION TO OPERATING CASH FLOW.

FREE CASH FLOW.

WE VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS A FACTOR IMPACTING THE AMOUNT OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT. IT IS DEFINED AS OPERATING CASH FLOW LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND IS ONE OF THE MEASURES USED TO EVALUATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND DETERMINE THEIR AT-RISK COMPENSATION.

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

FREE CASH FLOW WAS $10.9 BILLION IN 2013, AN INCREASE OF 17% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY, DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO NET EARNINGS, WAS 95% IN 2013.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

FREE CASH FLOW WAS $9.3 BILLION IN 2012, A DECREASE OF 7% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  FREE CASH FLOW DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL SPENDING TO SUPPORT GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION.  FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY, DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO NET EARNINGS, WAS 85% IN 2012.

INVESTING CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

NET INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSUMED $6.3 BILLION IN CASH IN 2013 MAINLY DUE TO CAPITAL SPENDING, CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET SALES.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

NET INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSUMED $1.1 BILLION IN CASH IN 2012 MAINLY DUE TO CAPITAL SPENDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES OF $2.9 BILLION. THESE PROCEEDS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO CASH RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR SNACKS BUSINESS IN 2012.

CAPITAL SPENDING.

WE MANAGE CAPITAL SPENDING TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS GROWTH PLANS AND HAVE COST CONTROLS TO DELIVER OUR CASH GENERATION TARGETS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT CAPACITY EXPANSION, INNOVATION AND COST SAVINGS, WERE $4.0 BILLION IN BOTH 2013 AND 2012.  CAPITAL SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS TO 4.8% IN 2013.  CAPITAL SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED 60 BASIS POINTS TO 4.7% IN 2012.

ACQUISITIONS.

ACQUISITIONS USED $1.1 BILLION OF CASH IN 2013 PRIMARILY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OUR PARTNER'S INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE IN IBERIA.  ACQUISITIONS USED $134 MILLION OF

38

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

CASH IN 2012 PRIMARILY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF NEW CHAPTER, A VITAMINS SUPPLEMENT BUSINESS.

PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES AND OTHER ASSET SALES.

PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED $584 MILLION IN CASH IN 2013 MAINLY DUE TO THE DIVESTITURES OF OUR BLEACH BUSINESS IN ITALY AND THE BRAUN HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES BUSINESS. PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED $2.9 BILLION TO CASH IN 2012 MAINLY DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR SNACKS BUSINESS.

FINANCING CASH FLOWS

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.

OUR FIRST DISCRETIONARY USE OF CASH IS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE INCREASED 7% TO $2.29 PER SHARE IN 2013.  TOTAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO COMMON AND PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS WERE $6.5 BILLION IN 2013 AND $6.1 BILLION IN 2012.  IN APRIL 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED AN INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND FROM $0.5620 TO $0.6015 PER SHARE ON COMMON STOCK AND SERIES A AND B ESOP CONVERTIBLE CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK. THIS REPRESENTS A 7% INCREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND IS THE 57TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR THAT OUR DIVIDEND HAS INCREASED. WE HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND IN EVERY YEAR SINCE OUR INCORPORATION IN 1890.

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT.

WE MAINTAIN DEBT LEVELS WE CONSIDER APPROPRIATE AFTER EVALUATING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CASH FLOW EXPECTATIONS, CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT AND FINANCING PLANS (INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES) AND THE OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL.  TOTAL DEBT WAS $31.5 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND $29.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012.  OUR TOTAL DEBT INCREASED IN 2013 MAINLY DUE TO DEBT ISSUANCES AND AN INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BOND MATURITIES.

TREASURY PURCHASES.

TOTAL SHARE REPURCHASES WERE $6.0 BILLION IN 2013 AND $4.0 BILLION IN 2012.

LIQUIDITY

AT JUNE 30, 2013, OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES EXCEEDED CURRENT ASSETS BY $6.0 BILLION, LARGELY DUE TO SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY AND OPERATING NEEDS LARGELY THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, A PORTION OF OUR CASH IS HELD OFF-SHORE BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES ITS CASH NEEDS AND THE AVAILABLE SOURCES TO FUND THESE NEEDS AND WE DO NOT EXPECT RESTRICTIONS OR TAXES ON REPATRIATION OF CASH HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  WE UTILIZE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO FUND DISCRETIONARY ITEMS, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  WE HAVE STRONG SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS, WHICH HAVE ENABLED AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO ENABLE US TO REFINANCE OUR DEBT AS IT BECOMES DUE AT FAVORABLE RATES IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BOND MARKETS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT, IF NEEDED, SHOULD PROVIDE

SUFFICIENT CREDIT FUNDING TO MEET SHORT-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.

ON JUNE 30, 2013, OUR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS WERE P-1 (MOODY'S) AND A-1+ (STANDARD & POOR'S), WHILE OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE AA3 (MOODY'S) AND AA- (STANDARD & POOR'S), BOTH WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK.

WE MAINTAIN BANK CREDIT FACILITIES TO SUPPORT OUR ONGOING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  THE CURRENT FACILITY IS AN $11.0 BILLION FACILITY SPLIT BETWEEN A $7.0 BILLION 5-YEAR FACILITY AND A $4.0 BILLION 364-DAY FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRE IN AUGUST 2018 AND AUGUST 2014, RESPECTIVELY.  THE 364-DAY FACILITY CAN BE EXTENDED FOR CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME AS SPECIFIED IN, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.    THESE FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY UNDRAWN AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL REMAIN LARGELY UNDRAWN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THESE CREDIT FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE CROSS-DEFAULT OR RATINGS TRIGGERS, NOR DO THEY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS CLAUSES, EXCEPT AT THE TIME OF SIGNING.  IN ADDITION TO THESE CREDIT FACILITIES, WE HAVE AN AUTOMATICALLY EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 FILED WITH THE SEC THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR REGISTERED OFFERINGS OF SHORT- OR LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE DO NOT HAVE GUARANTEES OR OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS A LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OF $2.0 BILLION, INCLUDING $447 MILLION OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES. DUE TO THE HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS OF LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BEYOND ONE YEAR, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT BEYOND TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE BALANCE SHEET DATE OF JUNE 30, 2013, CANNOT BE MADE.

REPRESENTS FUTURE PENSION PAYMENTS TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THESE FUTURE PENSION PAYMENTS ASSUME THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MEET ITS FUTURE STATUTORY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE EXPECTED FUTURE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING THE JULY 2013 CONTRIBUTION TO A FOREIGN PENSION PLAN OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION.  CONSIDERING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS CASH FLOWS ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE FUTURE STATUTORY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  THE PROJECTED PAYMENTS BEYOND FISCAL YEAR 2016 ARE NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE.

(4)

PRIMARILY REFLECTS FUTURE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS TAKE-OR-PAY ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO AS PART OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. COMMITMENTS MADE UNDER TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT FUTURE PURCHASES IN LINE WITH EXPECTED USAGE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING. APPROXIMATELY 20% RELATES TO SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND FACILITIES MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSOURCED. WHILE THE AMOUNTS LISTED REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FULL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT WOULD BE PAID IF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS WERE CANCELED PRIOR TO MATURITY. IN SUCH CASES, WE GENERALLY ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE NEW CONTRACTS OR CANCELLATION PENALTIES, RESULTING IN A REDUCED PAYMENT. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT TAKE-OR-PAY ARRANGEMENTS. SUCH CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE PRIMARILY PURCHASE ORDERS AT FAIR VALUE THAT ARE PART OF NORMAL OPERATIONS AND ARE REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL OPERATING CASH FLOW TRENDS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SUCH PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, THERE ARE CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MAY REQUIRE A CHOICE BETWEEN ACCEPTABLE ACCOUNTING METHODS OR MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION IN THEIR APPLICATION.  THESE INCLUDE INCOME TAXES, CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE BELIEVE THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND OTHERS SET FORTH IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SHOULD BE REVIEWED AS THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY HAS DISCUSSED THE SELECTION OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE EFFECT OF ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

INCOME TAXES

OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE IS DETERMINED BASED ON OUR INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND THE TAX IMPACTS OF ITEMS TREATED DIFFERENTLY FOR TAX PURPOSES THAN FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.  TAX LAW REQUIRES CERTAIN ITEMS BE INCLUDED IN THE TAX RETURN AT DIFFERENT TIMES THAN THE ITEMS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES ARE PERMANENT, SUCH AS EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE IN OUR TAX RETURN, AND SOME DIFFERENCES ARE TEMPORARY, REVERSING OVER TIME, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.  THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES CREATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT THE TAX EFFECT OF ITEMS THAT CAN BE USED AS A TAX DEDUCTION OR CREDIT IN FUTURE YEARS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY RECORDED THE TAX BENEFIT IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT.  DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES GENERALLY REPRESENT TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR WHICH PAYMENT HAS BEEN DEFERRED, THE TAX EFFECT OF

40

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

EXPENDITURES FOR WHICH A DEDUCTION HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN IN OUR TAX RETURN BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR ASSETS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO CORRESPONDING TAX BASIS ADJUSTMENT.

INHERENT IN DETERMINING OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE ARE JUDGMENTS REGARDING BUSINESS PLANS, PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECTATIONS ABOUT FUTURE OUTCOMES.  REALIZATION OF CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, PRIMARILY NET OPERATING LOSS AND OTHER CARRYFORWARDS, IS DEPENDENT UPON GENERATING SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE CARRYFORWARD PERIODS.  ALTHOUGH REALIZATION IS NOT ASSURED, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WILL BE REALIZED.

WE OPERATE IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS WITH COMPLEX TAX POLICY AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS.  IN CERTAIN OF THESE JURISDICTIONS, WE MAY TAKE TAX POSITIONS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE SUPPORTABLE, BUT ARE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY. THESE INTERPRETATIONAL DIFFERENCES WITH THE RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL TAXING AUTHORITIES CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE LOCAL ECONOMIC AND FISCAL ENVIRONMENT.  WE EVALUATE OUR TAX POSITIONS AND ESTABLISH LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES.  WE REVIEW THESE TAX UNCERTAINTIES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE PROGRESS OF TAX AUDITS, AND ADJUST THEM ACCORDINGLY.  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF AUDITS IN PROCESS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE RESOLUTION OF THESE TAX POSITIONS IS UNCERTAIN, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN CALCULATING THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF OUR TAX PROVISION, CERTAIN CHANGES OR FUTURE EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGES IN TAX LEGISLATION, GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, COMPLETION OF TAX AUDITS OR EARNINGS REPATRIATION PLANS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THOSE ESTIMATES AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE COMPANY'S INCOME TAXES, SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THESE INCLUDE PENSION PLANS, BOTH DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS AND DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR RETIREES.  FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS REQUIRE ASSUMPTIONS TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED AND ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: DISCOUNT RATE; EXPECTED SALARY INCREASES; CERTAIN EMPLOYEE-RELATED FACTORS, SUCH AS TURNOVER, RETIREMENT AGE AND MORTALITY; EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS AND HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES.  THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE ANNUAL EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS RECOGNIZED FOR THE UNDERLYING PLANS. OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES AND

MANAGEMENT'S BEST JUDGMENT REGARDING FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. AS PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP, THE NET AMOUNT BY WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS IS DEFERRED.  IF THIS NET DEFERRED AMOUNT EXCEEDS 10% OF THE GREATER OF PLAN ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, A PORTION OF THE DEFERRED AMOUNT IS INCLUDED IN EXPENSE FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR.  THE COST OR BENEFIT OF PLAN CHANGES, SUCH AS INCREASING OR DECREASING BENEFITS FOR PRIOR EMPLOYEE SERVICE (PRIOR SERVICE COST), IS DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF THE EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS.

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION IMPACTS OUR DEFINED BENEFIT EXPENSE, SINCE MANY OF OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OUR PRIMARY OPEB PLAN ARE PARTIALLY FUNDED.  THE PROCESS FOR SETTING THE EXPECTED RATES OF RETURN IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR 2013, THE AVERAGE RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS FOR PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND OPEB ASSETS WERE 7.3% AND 8.3%, RESPECTIVELY.  A CHANGE IN THE RATE OF RETURN OF 100 BASIS POINTS FOR BOTH PENSION AND OPEB ASSETS WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL AFTER-TAX BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION.

SINCE PENSION AND OPEB LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IMPACTS OUR PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES.  DISCOUNT RATES USED FOR OUR U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE BASED ON A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY BONDS FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS APPROXIMATE THE ESTIMATED PAYOUTS OF THE PLAN.  FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATES ARE SET BY BENCHMARKING AGAINST INVESTMENT GRADE CORPORATE BONDS RATED AA OR BETTER.  THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE ON THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OPEB PLANS OF 4.0% AND 4.8%, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF LOCAL RATES IN COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PLANS EXIST.  A 100-BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE PENSION DISCOUNT RATE WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL AFTER-TAX DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION.  A CHANGE IN THE OPEB DISCOUNT RATE OF 100 BASIS POINTS WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL AFTER-TAX OPEB EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION.  FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE OPERATIONS OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS STARTING FROM THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.  IN ADDITION, THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, WITH ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED RECORDED AS GOODWILL.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IN ASSIGNING THEIR RESPECTIVE USEFUL LIVES.  ACCORDINGLY, WE TYPICALLY OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY VALUATION SPECIALISTS FOR SIGNIFICANT TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON AVAILABLE HISTORICAL INFORMATION AND ON FUTURE EXPECTATIONS

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

AND ASSUMPTIONS DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT, BUT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

WE TYPICALLY USE AN INCOME METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON FORECASTS OF THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RESPECTIVE ASSETS.  SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN THE VALUATIONS REFLECT A CONSIDERATION OF OTHER MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS, AND INCLUDE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING EXPECTED GROWTH RATES AND PROFITABILITY), THE UNDERLYING PRODUCT OR TECHNOLOGY LIFE CYCLES, ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO ENTRY, A BRAND'S RELATIVE MARKET POSITION AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE CASH FLOWS. UNANTICIPATED MARKET OR MACROECONOMIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ALSO REQUIRES JUDGMENT.  CERTAIN BRAND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES BASED ON THEIR HISTORY AND OUR PLANS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND BUILD THE ACQUIRED BRANDS.  OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS (E.G., CERTAIN TRADEMARKS OR BRANDS, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, PATENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES) ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE DETERMINABLE USEFUL LIVES. OUR ASSESSMENT AS TO BRANDS THAT HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE AND THOSE THAT HAVE A DETERMINABLE LIFE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, MARKET SHARE, BRAND HISTORY, UNDERLYING PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, OPERATING PLANS AND THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE BRANDS ARE SOLD.  OUR ESTIMATES OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF DETERMINABLE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THESE SAME FACTORS.  ALL OF OUR ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE DETERMINABLE USEFUL LIVES.

THE COSTS OF DETERMINABLE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THEIR ESTIMATED LIVES.  THE VALUE OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND RESIDUAL GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS PERFORMED SEPARATELY FROM OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY REVIEWING THE BOOK VALUE COMPARED TO THE FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL.  WE TEST INDIVIDUAL INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY COMPARING THE BOOK VALUES OF EACH ASSET TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH.  UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF OPERATING AND MACROECONOMIC CHANGES AND TO ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.  ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS, SUCH AS FORECASTED GROWTH RATES AND COST OF CAPITAL, ARE CONSISTENT WITH INTERNAL PROJECTIONS AND OPERATING PLANS.  WE BELIEVE SUCH ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE ALSO COMPARABLE TO THOSE THAT WOULD BE USED BY OTHER MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS.  WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OCCUR, AN IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED AND

INDEFINITE-LIVED BRANDS MAY BE ADJUSTED TO A DETERMINABLE LIFE.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES, ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED RECORDED VALUES.  HOWEVER, FUTURE CHANGES IN THE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE USED IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT AND TAX RATES OR FUTURE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUES.  A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.  THE RECORDED VALUE OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM RECENTLY IMPAIRED BUSINESSES AND RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE DERIVED FROM MORE RECENT BUSINESS OPERATING PLANS AND MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND THEREFORE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN ADVERSE CHANGE THAT COULD REQUIRE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE GILLETTE INTANGIBLE AND GOODWILL AMOUNTS REPRESENT VALUES AS OF A MORE RECENT ACQUISITION DATE AND, AS SUCH, THE AMOUNTS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN IMPAIRMENT RISK IF BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS OR MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE.  GILLETTE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 89% OF THE $26.8 BILLION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT JUNE 30, 2013.  GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO STAND-ALONE REPORTING UNITS CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED AS PART OF THE GILLETTE ACQUISITION REPRESENTS 42% OF THE $55.2 BILLION OF GOODWILL AT JUNE 30, 2013.  THIS INCLUDES THE SHAVE CARE AND APPLIANCES BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE COMPONENTS OF THE GROOMING SEGMENT, AND THE BATTERIES BUSINESS, WHICH IS PART OF THE FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE SEGMENT.

THE RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING DURING FISCAL 2012 INDICATED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL REPORTING UNITS WERE LESS THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.  THEREFORE, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH BEFORE- AND AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3 BILLION IN FISCAL 2012.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING FISCAL 2012 INDICATED A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR KOLESTON PERFECT AND WELLA TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES.  THIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH, BEFORE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $246 MILLION ($173 MILLION AFTER-TAX) TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THESE ASSETS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR APPLIANCES REPORTING UNITS DECLINED FURTHER, BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT RESULTING FROM THE FISCAL 2012 IMPAIRMENT.  THEREFORE, WE RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL NON-CASH BEFORE AND AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $259 MILLION IN FISCAL 2013.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR FOURTH QUARTER 2013 IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR APPLIANCES INDICATED A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BRAUN TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSET BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.  THIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH, BEFORE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $49 MILLION ($31 MILLION AFTER-TAX) TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THIS ASSET TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

THE APPLIANCES BUSINESS WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE GILLETTE ACQUISITION IN 2005 AND THE SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF OPERATIONS ACQUIRED IN THE WELLA ACQUISITION IN 2004.  BOTH BUSINESSES ARE STAND-ALONE REPORTING UNITS.  THESE BUSINESSES REPRESENT SOME OF OUR MORE DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING CATEGORIES.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THEIR OPERATIONS AND UNDERLYING FAIR VALUES WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN FISCAL 2009, WHICH LED TO A REDUCTION IN HOME AND PERSONAL GROOMING APPLIANCE PURCHASES AND IN VISITS TO HAIR SALONS THAT DROVE THE FISCAL 2012 IMPAIRMENT.  THE ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE APPLIANCES BUSINESS IN FISCAL 2013 WAS DUE TO THE DEVALUATION OF CURRENCY IN JAPAN, A KEY COUNTRY THAT GENERATES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE EARNINGS OF THE APPLIANCES BUSINESS, RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCIES IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS ARE RECORDED.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE APPLIANCES BUSINESS HAS REMAINING GOODWILL OF $313 MILLION, WHILE THE SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS HAS REMAINING GOODWILL OF $424 MILLION.  AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENTS, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR APPLIANCES BUSINESS APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE, WHILE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS NOW SLIGHTLY EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE.  OUR FISCAL 2013 VALUATIONS OF THE APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES HAS THEM RETURNING TO SALES AND EARNINGS GROWTH RATES CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS PLANS.  FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BUSINESS PLANS OR A FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN A VALUATION THAT WOULD TRIGGER AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF THESE BUSINESSES.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

DURING FISCAL 2013, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2011-05, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220) - PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME" (ASU 2011-05), AND ASU 2013-02, “COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220) - REPORTING OF AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME” (ASU 2013-02).  THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS PART OF THE STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF NET EARNINGS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN EITHER A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS.  WE CHOSE TO PRESENT NET EARNINGS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS.  THIS GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY COMPONENT AND TO PRESENT, EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT WHERE NET INCOME IS PRESENTED OR IN THE NOTES, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS OF NET INCOME.  WE CHOSE TO PRESENT THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

NO OTHER NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ISSUED OR EFFECTIVE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR HAD OR IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OTHER INFORMATION

HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WITH DIVERSE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES.  WE EVALUATE EXPOSURES ON A CENTRALIZED BASIS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL EXPOSURE CORRELATION AND NETTING.  EXCEPT WITHIN FINANCING OPERATIONS, WE LEVERAGE THE COMPANY'S BROADLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF EXPOSURES AS A NATURAL HEDGE AND PRIORITIZE OPERATIONAL HEDGING ACTIVITIES OVER FINANCIAL MARKET INSTRUMENTS.  TO THE EXTENT WE CHOOSE TO FURTHER MANAGE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET EXPOSURES, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR USING THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  THESE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY OUR POLICIES COVERING ACCEPTABLE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE, INSTRUMENT TYPES AND OTHER HEDGING PRACTICES.  NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS CAN BE MONITORED USING TECHNIQUES INCLUDING MARKET VALUATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND VALUE-AT-RISK MODELING.  THE TESTS FOR INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY RATE AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS DISCUSSED BELOW ARE BASED ON THE CORPORATEMANAGERTM VALUE-AT-RISK MODEL USING A ONE-YEAR HORIZON AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.  THE MODEL INCORPORATES THE IMPACT OF CORRELATION (THE DEGREE TO WHICH EXPOSURES MOVE TOGETHER OVER TIME) AND DIVERSIFICATION (FROM HOLDING MULTIPLE CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS) AND ASSUMES THAT FINANCIAL RETURNS ARE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED.  ESTIMATES OF VOLATILITY AND CORRELATIONS OF MARKET FACTORS ARE DRAWN FROM THE RISKMETRICSTM DATASET AS OF JUNE 30, 2013.  IN CASES WHERE DATA IS UNAVAILABLE IN RISKMETRICSTM, A REASONABLE PROXY IS INCLUDED.

OUR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, HAVE NOT CHANGED MATERIALLY VERSUS THE PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT SUCH EXPOSURES IN THE NEAR TERM.

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE USED TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST RATE MOVEMENT ON UNDERLYING DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE DESIGNATED TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  THESE CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN NET INVESTMENTS.

BASED ON OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE AS OF AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES, WE BELIEVE A NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES, AT A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL BASED ON

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

43

HISTORICAL INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CURRENCY RATE EXPOSURE ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

BECAUSE WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS AND FINANCE OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT ON REVENUE AND EXPENSES OF MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  CORPORATE POLICY PRESCRIBES THE RANGE OF ALLOWABLE HEDGING ACTIVITY.  TO MANAGE THE EXCHANGE RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FINANCING OPERATIONS, WE PRIMARILY USE FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN 18 MONTHS.  IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN CURRENCY SWAPS WITH MATURITIES OF UP TO FIVE YEARS TO HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

BASED ON OUR CURRENCY RATE EXPOSURE ON DERIVATIVE AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS OF AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, WE BELIEVE, AT A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL BASED ON HISTORICAL CURRENCY RATE MOVEMENTS, THE IMPACT OF A NEAR-TERM CHANGE IN CURRENCY RATES WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

WE USE RAW MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE VOLATILITY CAUSED BY WEATHER, SUPPLY CONDITIONS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC VARIABLES AND OTHER UNPREDICTABLE FACTORS.  IN ADDITION TO FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS, WE MAY USE FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE VOLATILITY RELATED TO THE ABOVE EXPOSURES.

AS OF AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, WE DID NOT HAVE MATERIAL COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITY.

MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP

OUR DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDES SEVERAL "NON-GAAP" FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE OUR INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNDERLYING RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS WELL AS INSIGHT TO SOME OF THE METRICS USED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT.  WHEN USED IN MD&A, WE HAVE PROVIDED THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IN THE DISCUSSION. THESE MEASURES INCLUDE.

ORGANIC SALES GROWTH.

ORGANIC SALES GROWTH IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE OF SALES GROWTH EXCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FROM YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS.  WE BELIEVE THIS PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS BY PROVIDING SALES GROWTH ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. ORGANIC SALES IS ALSO ONE OF THE MEASURES USED TO EVALUATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THEIR AT-RISK COMPENSATION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE A NUMERICAL RECONCILIATION OF ORGANIC SALES GROWTH TO REPORTED NET SALES GROWTH.

CORE EPS.

THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE COMPANY'S DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE NOT JUDGED TO BE PART OF THE COMPANY'S SUSTAINABLE RESULTS OR TRENDS.  THIS INCLUDES A CHARGE IN 2013 FOR THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT FROM THE DEVALUATION OF THE OFFICIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE IN VENEZUELA, A HOLDING GAIN IN 2013 ON THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF OUR IBERIAN JOINT VENTURE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2013 AND 2012 FOR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CHARGES IN 2013 AND 2012 RELATED TO INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING DUE TO INCREASED FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS, A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT IN 2011 FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF U.S. TAX LITIGATION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE VALUATION OF TECHNOLOGY DONATIONS AND CHARGES IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 RELATED TO PENDING EUROPEAN LEGAL MATTERS.  WE DO NOT VIEW THESE ITEMS TO BE PART OF OUR SUSTAINABLE RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE THE CORE EPS MEASURE PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS AND RESULTS AND PROVIDES A MORE COMPARABLE MEASURE OF YEAR-ON-YEAR EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH.  CORE EPS IS ALSO ONE OF THE MEASURES USED TO EVALUATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THEIR AT-RISK COMPENSATION.

FREE CASH FLOW.

FREE CASH FLOW IS DEFINED AS OPERATING CASH FLOW LESS CAPITAL SPENDING.  WE VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS ONE FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT. FREE CASH FLOW IS ALSO ONE OF THE MEASURES USED TO EVALUATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THEIR AT-RISK COMPENSATION.

FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY.

FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO NET EARNINGS.  FREE CASH FLOW PRODUCTIVITY IS ALSO ONE OF THE MEASURES USED TO EVALUATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THEIR AT-RISK COMPENSATION.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

AT THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR LONG HISTORY OF DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. IF YOU ANALYZE WHAT'S MADE OUR COMPANY SUCCESSFUL OVER THE YEARS, YOU MAY FOCUS ON OUR BRANDS, OUR MARKETING STRATEGIES, OUR ORGANIZATION DESIGN AND OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE. BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET AT WHAT DRIVES OUR COMPANY'S SUCCESS, THE PLACE TO LOOK IS OUR PEOPLE. OUR PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO OUR PURPOSE, VALUES AND PRINCIPLES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THROUGH ITS AUDIT COMMITTEE, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT. WE HAVE ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP TO AUDIT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON WHICH THEY HAVE ISSUED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED). OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

STRONG INTERNAL CONTROLS IS AN OBJECTIVE THAT IS REINFORCED THROUGH OUR

WORLDWIDE BUSINESS CONDUCT MANUAL

, WHICH SETS FORTH OUR COMMITMENT TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH INTEGRITY, AND WITHIN BOTH THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES A CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT PROGRAM THAT IS CONDUCTED ANNUALLY FOR CRITICAL FINANCIAL REPORTING AREAS OF THE COMPANY AND IS AUDITED BY THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION. MANAGEMENT TAKES THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO CORRECT ANY IDENTIFIED CONTROL DEFICIENCIES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, ANY SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT A CONTROL CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED OR OVERRIDDEN OR THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR THAT ARE NOT DETECTED. ALSO, BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS MAY VARY OVER TIME.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

, USING CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) AND CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE "COMPANY") AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

AND

2012

, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

JUNE 30, 2013

.  THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.  AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY AT

JUNE 30, 2013

AND

2012

, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

JUNE 30, 2013

, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASU 2011-05,

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE "COMPANY") AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE

ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED

JUNE 30, 2013

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY'S (THE "COMPANY," "PROCTER & GAMBLE," "WE" OR "US") BUSINESS IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN MORE THAN

180

COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OPERATIONS INCLUDING MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SALONS, HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES AND E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE ON-THE-GROUND OPERATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY

70

COUNTRIES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY AND ITS CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES.  INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED.

USE OF ESTIMATES

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING DISCLOSURES.  THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THE COMPANY MAY UNDERTAKE IN THE FUTURE.  ESTIMATES ARE USED IN ACCOUNTING FOR, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, CONSUMER AND TRADE PROMOTION ACCRUALS, RESTRUCTURING RESERVES, PENSIONS, POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, STOCK OPTIONS, VALUATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, USEFUL LIVES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL, INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY ULTIMATELY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT GENERALLY BELIEVE SUCH DIFFERENCES WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANY INDIVIDUAL YEAR.  HOWEVER, IN REGARD TO ONGOING IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN FUTURE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS OR OTHER ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES VERSUS THOSE ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL VALUATIONS, COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN A GIVEN YEAR.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE IS REALIZED OR REALIZABLE AND HAS BEEN EARNED.  REVENUE TRANSACTIONS REPRESENT SALES OF INVENTORY.  THE REVENUE RECORDED IS PRESENTED NET OF SALES AND OTHER TAXES WE COLLECT ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  THE REVENUE INCLUDES SHIPPING AND HANDLING

COSTS, WHICH GENERALLY ARE INCLUDED IN THE LIST PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  OUR POLICY IS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN TITLE TO THE PRODUCT, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS TRANSFER TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH CAN BE ON THE DATE OF SHIPMENT OR THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER.  A PROVISION FOR PAYMENT DISCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURN ALLOWANCES IS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

TRADE PROMOTIONS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF CUSTOMER PRICING ALLOWANCES, MERCHANDISING FUNDS AND CONSUMER COUPONS, ARE OFFERED THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS.  SALES ARE RECORDED NET OF TRADE PROMOTION SPENDING, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED, GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF THE SALE.  MOST OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE TERMS OF APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR.  ACCRUALS FOR EXPECTED PAYOUTS UNDER THESE PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED AS ACCRUED MARKETING AND PROMOTION IN THE ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF DIRECT MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES CONSUMED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCT, AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING LABOR, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND DIRECT OVERHEAD EXPENSE NECESSARY TO ACQUIRE AND CONVERT THE PURCHASED MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES INTO FINISHED PRODUCT.  COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD ALSO INCLUDES THE COST TO DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, INBOUND FREIGHT COSTS, INTERNAL TRANSFER COSTS, WAREHOUSING COSTS AND OTHER SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITY.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A) IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF MARKETING EXPENSES, SELLING EXPENSES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER INDIRECT OVERHEAD COSTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON NON-MANUFACTURING ASSETS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS OPERATING ITEMS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED AND WERE

$2.0 BILLION

IN

2013

,

2012

AND

2011

.  ADVERTISING COSTS, CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, INCLUDE WORLDWIDE TELEVISION, PRINT, RADIO, INTERNET AND IN-STORE ADVERTISING EXPENSES AND WERE

$9.7

BILLION IN

2013

,

$9.3

BILLION IN

2012

AND

$9.2

2011

.  NON-ADVERTISING RELATED COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL MARKETING SPENDING INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER PROMOTIONS, PRODUCT SAMPLING AND SALES AIDS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SG&A, AS WELL AS COUPONS AND CUSTOMER TRADE FUNDS, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS REDUCTIONS TO NET SALES.

OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET

OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET, PRIMARILY INCLUDES NET ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE GAINS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.

AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

54

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. GENERALLY ARE MEASURED USING THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.  ADJUSTMENTS TO TRANSLATE THOSE STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).  CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN ACCUMULATED OCI WERE A GAIN OF

$353

AT

JUNE 30, 2013

AND A LOSS OF

$357

AT

JUNE 30, 2012

.  FOR SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.  RE-MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONAL EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS.

CASH FLOW PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS ARE PREPARED USING THE INDIRECT METHOD, WHICH RECONCILES NET EARNINGS TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  THE RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATING RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS AND THEIR RECOGNITION IN NET EARNINGS.  THE ADJUSTMENTS ALSO REMOVE CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT AN AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD.  CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.  CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM NON-QUALIFYING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED TO HEDGE CURRENCY EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED TO MANAGE INTEREST, COMMODITY OR OTHER CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH REMAINING STATED MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED ARE CONSIDERED CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RECORDED AT COST.

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENT SECURITIES CONSIST OF READILY MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.  UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FOR INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ARE CHARGED TO EARNINGS.  UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN OCI.  IF AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITY IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, THE LOSS IS CHARGED TO EITHER EARNINGS OR OCI DEPENDING ON OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN THE SECURITY UNTIL WE RECOVER THE FULL COST BASIS AND THE EXTENT OF THE LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE ISSUER.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE

INCLUDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN COMPANIES OVER WHICH WE EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DECISIONS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.  OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED, AND OVER WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.  BOTH EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET VALUE. PRODUCT-RELATED INVENTORIES ARE PRIMARILY MAINTAINED ON THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD.  MINOR AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT INVENTORIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN COSMETICS AND COMMODITIES, ARE MAINTAINED ON THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD.  THE COST OF SPARE PART INVENTORIES IS MAINTAINED USING THE AVERAGE-COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS RECORDED AT COST REDUCED BY ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE ASSETS' ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.  MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDES OFFICE FURNITURE AND FIXTURES (15-YEAR LIFE), COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE (3- TO 5-YEAR LIVES) AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (3- TO 20-YEAR LIVES).  BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER AN ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF 40 YEARS. ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, CHANGES ARE MADE PROSPECTIVELY.  WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OCCUR, ASSET LIVES MAY BE ADJUSTED AND AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT MAY BE PERFORMED ON THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE OFTEN IF INDICATORS OF A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT ARE PRESENT.  OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL IS PERFORMED SEPARATELY FROM OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE ANNUAL EVALUATION FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS BASED ON VALUATION MODELS THAT INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS AND INTERNAL PROJECTIONS OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OPERATING PLANS.  WE BELIEVE SUCH ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO COMPARABLE TO THOSE THAT WOULD BE USED BY OTHER MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS.

WE HAVE ACQUIRED BRANDS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES.  WE EVALUATE A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDEFINITE LIFE IS APPROPRIATE, INCLUDING THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, MARKET SHARE, BRAND HISTORY, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, OPERATING PLANS AND THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE BRANDS ARE SOLD. WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OCCUR, AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED AND

AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

55

INDEFINITE-LIVED BRANDS MAY BE ADJUSTED TO A DETERMINABLE LIFE.

THE COST OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE USEFUL LIVES IS AMORTIZED TO REFLECT THE PATTERN OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS CONSUMED, EITHER ON A STRAIGHT-LINE OR ACCELERATED BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIODS BENEFITED.  PATENTS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL TERMS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE LEGAL OR CONTRACTUAL LIVES. CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, BRANDS AND OTHER NON-CONTRACTUAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS GENERALLY RANGING FROM

5

TO

30

YEARS.  WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OCCUR, AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED AND REMAINING LIVES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES MAY BE ADJUSTED.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.  CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATION METHODS COULD AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER INVESTMENTS AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, ARE RECORDED AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.  THE FAIR VALUES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 5.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND POLICIES

OTHER THAN AS DESCRIBED BELOW, NO NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ISSUED OR EFFECTIVE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR HAD OR IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING FISCAL 2013, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2011-05, "COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220) - PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME", AND ASU 2013-02, “COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220) - REPORTING OF AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME”.  THIS GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF OCI AS PART OF THE STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF NET EARNINGS AND OCI IN EITHER A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS.  WE CHOSE TO PRESENT NET EARNINGS AND OCI IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS.  THIS GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) BY COMPONENT AND TO PRESENT, EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT WHERE NET INCOME IS PRESENTED OR IN THE NOTES, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI BY THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS OF NET INCOME.  WE CHOSE TO PRESENT THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (SEE NOTE 6).  THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

IN OCTOBER 2012, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED OUR PARTNER'S INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE IN IBERIA THAT OPERATES IN OUR BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE AND HEALTH CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. WE PAID

$1.1 BILLION

FOR OUR PARTNER'S INTEREST AND THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE TOTAL ENTERPRISE VALUE OF

$1.9 BILLION

WAS ALLOCATED TO INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF

$0.2 BILLION

, DEFINED-LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF

$0.9 BILLION

AND GOODWILL OF

$1.1 BILLION

. THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

$0.3 BILLION

OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ON THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A

$0.6 BILLION

HOLDING GAIN ON ITS PREVIOUSLY HELD INVESTMENT, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2013.  IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS AND THE IMPAIRMENT DISCUSSED BELOW, THE REMAINING NET INCREASE IN GOODWILL SINCE JUNE 30, 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION ACROSS ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR APPLIANCES REPORTING UNIT DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH BEFORE AND AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$259

IN FISCAL 2013 TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE SAME FACTORS THAT LED TO THE DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT LED TO A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BRAUN TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSET BELOW ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUE.  THIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH BEFORE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$49

(

$31

AFTER-TAX) TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THIS ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE RESULTS OF OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING DURING FISCAL 2012 DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OUR APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL REPORTING UNITS WERE LESS THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH BEFORE AND AFTER-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$1.3 BILLION

IN FISCAL 2012 TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE;

$899

OF THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO APPLIANCES AND

$431

RELATED TO SALON PROFESSIONAL.

OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING FISCAL 2012 ALSO INDICATED A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR KOLESTON PERFECT AND WELLA TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES.  THIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH BEFORE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$246

(

$173

AFTER-TAX) TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THESE ASSETS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES.

ALL OF THE FISCAL 2013 AND 2012 GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING.

THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET VALUATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OVERALL CATEGORY GROWTH RATES, COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, COST CONTAINMENT AND MARGIN EXPANSION AND COMPANY BUSINESS PLANS.  WE BELIEVE THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE.  HOWEVER, ACTUAL EVENTS AND RESULTS COULD DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THOSE USED IN OUR VALUATIONS.  TO THE EXTENT SUCH FACTORS RESULT IN A FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE LEVEL OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS

USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE, WE MAY NEED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FUTURE.

THE FISCAL 2013 DECLINES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE APPLIANCES REPORTING UNIT AND THE BRAUN TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSET WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CURRENCY IMPACTS.  SPECIFICALLY, CURRENCY IN JAPAN, A COUNTRY THAT GENERATES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE APPLIANCES EARNINGS, DEVALUED APPROXIMATELY

20%

IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2013 RELATIVE TO THE CURRENCIES IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS ARE RECORDED.  THIS SUSTAINED REDUCTION IN THE YEN REDUCED THE UNDERLYING CATEGORY MARKET SIZE AND THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESS, WHICH IN TURN TRIGGERED THE IMPAIRMENT.

THE FISCAL 2012 DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL REPORTING UNITS AND THE UNDERLYING KOLESTON PERFECT AND WELLA TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF SIMILAR COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE FORECASTED GROWTH RATES AND CASH FLOWS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE.  THE FACTORS INCLUDED: (1) A MORE PROLONGED AND DEEPER DETERIORATION OF THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED WHICH, DUE TO THE MORE DISCRETIONARY NATURE OF THE APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL BUSINESSES, LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL MARKET SIZE IN THE SHORT TERM AND A MORE SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED REDUCTION IN THE EXPECTED UNDERLYING MARKET GROWTH RATES AND RESULTING SALES LEVELS IN THE LONGER TERM. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN EUROPE, WHERE WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A MAJORITY OF THE APPLIANCES AND SALON PROFESSIONAL SALES; (2) INCREASING COMPETITIVE LEVELS OF INNOVATION IN SALON PROFESSIONAL, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR CURRENT AND NEARER-TERM PROJECTED MARKET SHARE PROGRESS; AND, (3) AN INCREASING LEVEL OF COMPETITIVE PRICING ACTIVITIES, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OVERALL CATEGORY PROFITABILITY.  AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE REDUCED OUR CURRENT AND LONG-TERM SALES AND EARNINGS FORECASTS FOR THESE BUSINESSES.

IN ADDITION TO THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DISCUSSED ABOVE, GOODWILL ALSO DECREASED IN FISCAL 2012 DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION ACROSS ALL REPORTING SEGMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOODWILL RELATED TO THE BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS LTD. IN OUR HEALTH CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY INCURRED AN ONGOING ANNUAL LEVEL OF RESTRUCTURING-TYPE ACTIVITIES TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION.  BEFORE-TAX COSTS INCURRED UNDER THE ONGOING PROGRAM HAVE GENERALLY RANGED FROM

$250

TO

$500

ANNUALLY.  IN FEBRUARY AND NOVEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY MADE ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING AN INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AS PART OF A PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN TO REDUCE COSTS IN THE AREAS OF SUPPLY CHAIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND OVERHEADS.  THE PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SAVINGS PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ACCELERATE COST REDUCTIONS BY STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING, MANUFACTURING AND OTHER WORK PROCESSES IN ORDER TO HELP FUND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR IN EXCESS OF

$3.5 BILLION

IN BEFORE-TAX RESTRUCTURING COSTS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD (FROM FISCAL 2012 THROUGH FISCAL 2016), INCLUDING COSTS INCURRED AS PART OF THE ONGOING AND INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.  THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED APPROXIMATELY

55%

OF THE COSTS UNDER THIS PLAN AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2013, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2016.

THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IS BEING EXECUTED ACROSS THE COMPANY'S CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS ACROSS VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS MARKET DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS (MDO) AND GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS (GBU).  THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM PLANS INCLUDED AN INITIAL TARGETED NET REDUCTION IN NON-MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD ENROLLMENT OF

AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

58

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

APPROXIMATELY

5,700

BY THE END OF FISCAL 2013.  THROUGH FISCAL 2013, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED NON-MANUFACTURING ENROLLMENT BY APPROXIMATELY

7,000

, WHICH IS

1,300

POSITIONS ABOVE THE INITIAL TARGET.  IN ADDITION TO THE REDUCTION OF

5,700

EMPLOYEES, THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM INCLUDES PLANS FOR A FURTHER NON-MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD PERSONNEL REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY

2%

-

4%

ANNUALLY FROM FISCAL 2014 THROUGH FISCAL 2016, ROUGHLY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE INITIAL ENROLLMENT REDUCTION TARGET.  THIS IS BEING DONE VIA THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE WORK, SIMPLIFICATION THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL FOOTPRINT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN INCLUDES INTEGRATION OF NEWLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS INCURRED CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COSTS TO SEPARATE EMPLOYEES AND ASSET-RELATED COSTS TO EXIT FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO INCURRING OTHER TYPES OF COSTS AS OUTLINED BELOW.  THE COMPANY INCURRED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $956 MILLION

AND $1.1 BILLION

FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012, RESPECTIVELY.  APPROXIMATELY $600

AND $746

OF THESE CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN SG&A FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012, RESPECTIVELY.  THE REMAINDER IS INCLUDED IN COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD.  SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION

.  APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION

OF THESE CHARGES WERE RELATED TO SEPARATIONS, $487 MILLION

WERE ASSET-RELATED AND $431 MILLION

SEPARATION COSTS

EMPLOYEE SEPARATION CHARGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012 RELATE TO SEVERANCE PACKAGES FOR APPROXIMATELY

3,450

AND

3,300

EMPLOYEES, RESPECTIVELY.  FOR

THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012, THESE SEVERANCE PACKAGES INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY

2,390

AND

2,250

NON-MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE SEPARATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE.  THE PACKAGES ARE PREDOMINANTLY VOLUNTARY AND THE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON SALARY LEVELS AND PAST SERVICE PERIODS.  SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO VOLUNTARY SEPARATIONS ARE GENERALLY CHARGED TO EARNINGS WHEN THE EMPLOYEE ACCEPTS THE OFFER.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM HAS INCURRED SEPARATION CHARGES RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY

6,750

EMPLOYEES, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY

4,640

ARE NON-MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD PERSONNEL.

ASSET-RELATED COSTS

ASSET-RELATED COSTS CONSIST OF BOTH ASSET WRITE-DOWNS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION.  ASSET WRITE-DOWNS RELATE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FAIR VALUE BASIS FOR ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE OR DISPOSAL.  THESE ASSETS WERE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE LOWER OF THEIR CURRENT CARRYING BASIS OR AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED UPON DISPOSAL, LESS MINOR DISPOSAL COSTS.  CHARGES FOR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION RELATE TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE PRIOR TO THE END OF THEIR NORMAL SERVICE PERIOD.  THESE ASSETS RELATE PRIMARILY TO MANUFACTURING CONSOLIDATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY STANDARDIZATION.  THE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FUTURE DEPRECIATION CHARGES.

OTHER COSTS

OTHER RESTRUCTURING-TYPE CHARGES ARE INCURRED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.  SUCH CHARGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE EMPLOYEE RELOCATION RELATED TO SEPARATIONS AND OFFICE CONSOLIDATIONS, TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS RELATED TO SUPPLY CHAIN REDESIGN AND THE COST TO CHANGE INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES.

CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL POLICIES FOR ONGOING RESTRUCTURING-TYPE ACTIVITIES, THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM CHARGES ARE FUNDED BY AND INCLUDED WITHIN CORPORATE FOR BOTH MANAGEMENT AND SEGMENT REPORTING.  ACCORDINGLY, 100% OF THE CHARGES UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE CORPORATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

AS A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WITH DIVERSE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES.  WE EVALUATE EXPOSURES ON A CENTRALIZED BASIS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL EXPOSURE CORRELATION AND NETTING.  TO THE EXTENT WE CHOOSE TO MANAGE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET EXPOSURES, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT WE ACCOUNT FOR USING THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  THESE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY OUR POLICIES COVERING ACCEPTABLE COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE, INSTRUMENT TYPES AND OTHER HEDGING PRACTICES.

AT INCEPTION, WE FORMALLY DESIGNATE AND DOCUMENT QUALIFYING INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF UNDERLYING EXPOSURES. WE FORMALLY ASSESS, AT INCEPTION AND AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WHETHER THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE AT OFFSETTING CHANGES IN EITHER THE FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE RELATED UNDERLYING EXPOSURES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY ARE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR CASH FLOWS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.  THIS IS DRIVEN BY THE HIGH DEGREE OF EFFECTIVENESS BETWEEN THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED AND THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT.  THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF A CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A QUALIFYING INSTRUMENT IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  THE AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS RECOGNIZED WAS IMMATERIAL FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

WE HAVE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES AND NORMALLY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED DAILY AND DOWNGRADES IN COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS ARE REVIEWED ON A TIMELY BASIS. WE HAVE NOT INCURRED, AND DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR, MATERIAL CREDIT LOSSES ON OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY INDUSTRY STANDARD NETTING AND COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES.  IF THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATING WERE TO FALL BELOW THE LEVELS STIPULATED IN THE AGREEMENTS, THE COUNTERPARTIES COULD DEMAND EITHER COLLATERALIZATION OR TERMINATION OF THE

AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

ARRANGEMENTS.  THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS COVERED BY THESE CONTRACTUAL FEATURES THAT ARE IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

, WAS NOT MATERIAL.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL AS A RESULT OF THESE CONTRACTUAL FEATURES.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

OUR POLICY IS TO MANAGE INTEREST COST USING A MIXTURE OF FIXED-RATE AND VARIABLE-RATE DEBT.  TO MANAGE THIS RISK IN A COST-EFFICIENT MANNER, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WHEREBY WE AGREE TO EXCHANGE WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO A NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT MEET SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING CRITERIA ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGES.  FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF BOTH THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND THE UNDERLYING DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT OBLIGATION.  THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION FOR BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY YEAR PRESENTED, WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND FINANCE OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

TO MANAGE THE EXCHANGE RATE RISK PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FINANCING OPERATIONS, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED A COMBINATION OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND CURRENCY SWAPS.  AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

, WE HAD CURRENCY SWAPS WITH MATURITIES UP TO FIVE YEARS, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  THESE SWAPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.  THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO SG&A AND INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS.  THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY YEAR PRESENTED, WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN SG&A.

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN NON-QUALIFYING INSTRUMENTS USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN BALANCE SHEET ITEMS SUBJECT TO REVALUATION ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETTING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING

WE HEDGE CERTAIN NET INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE EITHER BORROW DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND DESIGNATE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT AS A HEDGE OF THE APPLICABLE NET INVESTMENT POSITION OR WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS.  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN OCI TO OFFSET THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE NET INVESTMENT BEING HEDGED.  CURRENCY EFFECTS OF THESE HEDGES REFLECTED IN OCI WERE AFTER-TAX GAINS OF

$156

AND

$740

IN

2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.  ACCUMULATED NET BALANCES WERE AFTER-TAX LOSSES OF

$3,550

AND

$3,706

AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN ANY YEAR PRESENTED, WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTION PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE VOLATILITY CAUSED BY WEATHER, SUPPLY CONDITIONS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC VARIABLES AND OTHER UNPREDICTABLE FACTORS.  TO MANAGE THE VOLATILITY RELATED TO ANTICIPATED PURCHASES OF CERTAIN OF THESE MATERIALS, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY, ON A LIMITED BASIS, USED FUTURES AND OPTIONS WITH MATURITIES GENERALLY LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND SWAP CONTRACTS WITH MATURITIES UP TO FIVE YEARS.  AS OF AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, WE DID NOT HAVE MATERIAL COMMODITY HEDGING ACTIVITY.

INSURANCE

WE SELF-INSURE FOR MOST INSURABLE RISKS.  HOWEVER, WE PURCHASE INSURANCE FOR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY AND CERTAIN OTHER COVERAGE WHERE IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW, BY CONTRACT OR DEEMED TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE BE CLASSIFIED AND DISCLOSED IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

LEVEL 1:     QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2:     OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS OR UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3:     UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECTING THE REPORTING ENTITY'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS OR EXTERNAL INPUTS FROM INACTIVE MARKETS.

WHEN APPLYING FAIR VALUE PRINCIPLES IN THE VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED ITS VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY FINANCIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR.  OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CREDIT RISK OF BOTH THE COMPANY AND OUR COUNTERPARTIES.

WHEN ACTIVE MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE USE INDUSTRY STANDARD VALUATION MODELS.  WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE

AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, INTEREST RATE CURVES, FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES.  IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT IS USED TO DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS IS ESTIMATED AS THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON EXTERNAL INPUTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, IF ANY, AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.  DURING FISCAL 2013, THE COMPANY TRANSFERRED LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$455

FROM LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 2.  THE TRANSFERRED INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS WHICH ARE INFREQUENTLY TRADED IN AN OBSERVABLE MARKET.  THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY WITHIN THE LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

DURING FISCAL 2013 AND 2012, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  ALSO, DURING FISCAL 2013, WE APPLIED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING AND RE-MEASURED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF THE BALANCE OF A JOINT VENTURE IN IBERIA (SEE NOTE 2 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THESE ITEMS).  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RE-MEASURED CERTAIN OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS TO AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

$8

DURING THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, USING COMPARABLE PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS, RESULTING IN A

$220

IMPAIRMENT.  EXCEPT FOR THESE ITEMS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT WERE RE-MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS DURING THE YEARS PRESENTED.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE HAVE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER WHICH WE ANNUALLY GRANT STOCK OPTION, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT (RSU) AND PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT (PSU) AWARDS TO KEY MANAGERS AND DIRECTORS.  EXERCISE PRICES ON OPTIONS GRANTED HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, SET EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT.  SINCE SEPTEMBER 2002, THE KEY MANAGER STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED VEST AFTER THREE YEARS AND HAVE A

10

-YEAR LIFE.  THE KEY MANAGER STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED FROM JULY 1998 THROUGH AUGUST 2002 VESTED AFTER THREE YEARS AND HAVE A

15

-YEAR LIFE.  KEY MANAGERS CAN ELECT TO RECEIVE UP TO 100% OF THE VALUE OF THEIR OPTION AWARD IN RSUS.  KEY MANAGER RSUS VEST AND ARE SETTLED IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FIVE YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE.  THE AWARDS PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS ARE IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS.

IN ADDITION TO OUR KEY MANAGER AND DIRECTOR GRANTS, WE MAKE OTHER MINOR STOCK OPTION AND RSU GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES FOR WHICH THE TERMS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE

DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.  IN 2011, WE IMPLEMENTED A PERFORMANCE STOCK PROGRAM (PSP) AND GRANTED PSUS TO SENIOR LEVEL EXECUTIVES.  UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THE NUMBER OF PSUS THAT WILL VEST THREE YEARS AFTER THE RESPECTIVE GRANT DATE IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO PRE-ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE GOALS DURING THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD.

A TOTAL OF

180 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN 2003 AND 2009.  A TOTAL OF

56 MILLION

SHARES REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2003 AND 2009 PLANS.

LATTICE-BASED OPTION VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE RANGES OF ASSUMPTIONS FOR INPUTS AND THOSE RANGES ARE DISCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.  EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK AND IMPLIED VOLATILITIES OF CALL OPTIONS ON OUR STOCK.  WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION EXERCISE AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATION PATTERNS WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL.  THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IS DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL AND REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING.  THE INTEREST RATE FOR PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE OPTIONS IS BASED ON THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF GRANT.

SEVERAL FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING THE ESTIMATE FOR THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. FOR THE DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS, THESE FACTORS INCLUDE HISTORICAL RATES OF RETURN OF BROAD EQUITY AND BOND INDICES AND PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN OBTAINED FROM PENSION INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE

8

-

9%

FOR EQUITIES AND

5

-

6%

FOR BONDS. FOR OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE ASSETS ARE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF COMPANY STOCK. THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON COMPANY STOCK IS BASED ON THE LONG-TERM PROJECTED RETURN OF

8.5%

AND REFLECTS THE HISTORICAL PATTERN OF RETURNS.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

PLAN ASSETS.

OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS IS TO MEET THE PLANS' BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, WHILE MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE REQUIRED COMPANY PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS.  THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES FOCUS ON ASSET CLASS DIVERSIFICATION, LIQUIDITY TO MEET BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURN AND RISK.  TARGET RANGES FOR ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE DETERMINED BY MATCHING THE ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS OF THE PLANS' FUTURE LIABILITIES AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSETS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT RETURN VOLATILITY AND CORRELATIONS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES.  PLAN ASSETS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACROSS SEVERAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND ARE GENERALLY INVESTED IN LIQUID FUNDS THAT ARE SELECTED TO TRACK BROAD MARKET EQUITY AND BOND INDICES.  INVESTMENT RISK IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED WITH PLAN ASSETS REBALANCED TO TARGET ALLOCATIONS ON A PERIODIC BASIS AND WITH CONTINUAL MONITORING OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS' PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED WITH EACH INVESTMENT MANAGER.

$1.0 BILLION

IN JULY 2013.  FOR OTHER RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS, THIS IS COMPRISED OF EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE USED DIRECTLY FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS.  EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING THE VARIABILITY OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS AS COMPARED TO THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND OTHER MARKET OR REGULATORY CONDITIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OUR BUSINESS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND RESULTING CASH REQUIREMENTS.  ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL FUNDING MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES.

ADVANCES TO THE ESOP BY THE COMPANY ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE IN THE RESERVE FOR ESOP DEBT RETIREMENT.  INTEREST INCURRED ON THE ESOP DEBT IS RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE.  DIVIDENDS ON ALL PREFERRED SHARES, NET OF RELATED TAX BENEFITS, ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY IS PRESENT IN APPROXIMATELY

150

TAXABLE JURISDICTIONS AND, AT ANY POINT IN TIME, HAS

40-50

JURISDICTIONAL AUDITS UNDERWAY AT VARIOUS STAGES OF COMPLETION.  WE EVALUATE OUR TAX POSITIONS AND ESTABLISH LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT MAY BE CHALLENGED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND MAY NOT BE FULLY SUSTAINED, DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT THE UNDERLYING TAX POSITIONS ARE FULLY SUPPORTABLE.  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND ARE ADJUSTED IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING PROGRESS OF TAX AUDITS, DEVELOPMENTS IN CASE LAW AND CLOSING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE TAX PROVISION AS APPROPRIATE.  THE COMPANY IS MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT TO BRING ITS AUDIT INVENTORY TO A MORE CURRENT POSITION.  WE HAVE DONE THIS BY WORKING WITH TAX AUTHORITIES TO CONDUCT AUDITS FOR SEVERAL OPEN YEARS AT ONCE.  WE HAVE TAX YEARS OPEN RANGING FROM

2002

AND FORWARD.  WE ARE GENERALLY NOT ABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE AUDIT.  WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT MATERIAL CHANGES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED BENEFIT WITH RESPECT TO OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RELATED TO THE AUDITS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF IMPACT ON THE BALANCE OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OR THE IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RELATED TO THESE ITEMS.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS REQUIRE THAT, WITHOUT DISCRETION, WE RECOGNIZE THE ADDITIONAL ACCRUAL OF ANY POSSIBLE RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE, UNLESS THE COMPANY QUALIFIES FOR A SPECIFIC EXCEPTION.  AS OF

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

GUARANTEES

IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY DIVESTITURES, WE MAY PROVIDE ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS (E.G., INDEMNIFICATION FOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND RETENTION OF PREVIOUSLY EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND EMPLOYEE LIABILITIES) FOR WHICH TERMS RANGE IN DURATION AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT EXPLICITLY DEFINED.  THE MAXIMUM OBLIGATION UNDER SOME INDEMNIFICATIONS IS ALSO NOT EXPLICITLY STATED AND, AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  OTHER THAN OBLIGATIONS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AT THE TIME OF DIVESTITURE, WE HAVE NOT MADE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE WERE TO INCUR A LOSS ON ANY OF THESE MATTERS, THE LOSS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

LITIGATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OUR BUSINESS WHICH COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS SUCH AS ANTITRUST, TRADE AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT AND TRADEMARK MATTERS, ADVERTISING, CONTRACTS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENTS MATTERS AND INCOME AND OTHER TAXES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS HAD A NUMBER OF ANTITRUST MATTERS IN EUROPE.  THESE MATTERS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANIES AND/OR RETAIL CUSTOMERS.  SEVERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE HAVE ISSUED SEPARATE DECISIONS PURSUANT TO THEIR INVESTIGATIONS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGED IN VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION LAWS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.  THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED THE ASSESSED FINES FOR EACH OF THE DECISIONS, OF WHICH ALL BUT

$16

HAS BEEN PAID AS OF JUNE 30, 2013.  SOME OF THOSE ARE ON APPEAL.  AS A

RESULT OF OUR INITIAL AND ON-GOING ANALYSES OF OTHER FORMAL COMPLAINTS, THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS TOTALING

$139

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013.  WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS MAY RESULT IN FINES OR COSTS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS RESERVED, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SUCH INCREMENTAL LOSSES TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE ACCRUED AND PAID, RESPECTIVELY.

WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS, WHILE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR COUNSEL, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS WILL NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE US TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR MANUFACTURING AND WASTE DISPOSAL PRACTICES.  BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.  ACCORDINGLY, THESE PARTIALLY OWNED OPERATIONS ARE REFLECTED AS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN SEGMENT RESULTS, WITH FULL RECOGNITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEMS THROUGH BEFORE-TAX EARNINGS.  ELIMINATIONS TO ADJUST THESE LINE ITEMS TO U.S. GAAP ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.  IN DETERMINING AFTER-TAX EARNINGS FOR THE BUSINESSES, WE ELIMINATE THE SHARE OF EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST, AND APPLY STATUTORY TAX RATES.  ADJUSTMENTS TO ARRIVE AT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.

CORPORATE INCLUDES CERTAIN OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS USED INTERNALLY TO MEASURE AND EVALUATE THE BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ELIMINATIONS TO ADJUST MANAGEMENT REPORTING PRINCIPLES TO U.S. GAAP. OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN CORPORATE INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF INCIDENTAL BUSINESSES MANAGED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL ALONG WITH THE ELIMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERATED BY CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTEES, DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OVER WHICH WE EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT DO NOT CONTROL.  OPERATING ELEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, THE COSTS OF CERTAIN RESTRUCTURING-TYPE ACTIVITIES TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE ITEMS.  THE NON-OPERATING ELEMENTS IN CORPORATE PRIMARILY INCLUDE INTEREST EXPENSE, ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE GAINS AND INTEREST AND INVESTING INCOME.  IN ADDITION, CORPORATE INCLUDES THE HISTORICAL RESULTS OF CERTAIN DIVESTED BUSINESSES.

TOTAL ASSETS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS INCLUDE THOSE ASSETS MANAGED BY THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY INVENTORY, FIXED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  OTHER ASSETS, PRIMARILY INCLUDING CASH, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND GOODWILL, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, 1997. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS ON OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE: (I) GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II) GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH OF DEPARTURE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK MAY BE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANY'S FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS AND TO STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK. THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION SHARES. UNDER THE PLAN'S REGULATIONS, RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. THESE OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING BOARD APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FROM THE DATE OF THIS FIRST GRANT THROUGH JUNE 30, 2003, EACH NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FOLLOWING THE GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30, 2003, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN TERMINATED ON OCTOBER 13, 2007.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY APPROVED THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN ON MAY 20, 2004, AND THE PLAN WAS ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE ON OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF .975 SHARES OF P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK. ONLY EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY THE GILLETTE COMPANY PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1, 2005 ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS UNDER THIS PLAN.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY, AND UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER BETWEEN THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF THE GILLETTE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ARE: (I) GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II) GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS). SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CAPITALIZATION AND THE ADDITION OF ANY SHARES AUTHORIZED BUT NOT ISSUED OR REDEEMED UNDER THE GILLETTE COMPANY 1971 STOCK OPTION PLAN, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 19,000,000 SHARES.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT: (1) ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, RETIREMENT, SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE PLAN) OR ANY GRANTS AS TO WHICH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS WAIVED THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS; AND (2) ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF

DEATH, RETIREMENT, SPECIAL SEPARATION, VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION THAT IS NOT FOR GOOD REASON (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE PLAN) OR ANY GRANTS AS TO WHICH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS WAIVED THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS.
