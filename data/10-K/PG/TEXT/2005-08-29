the procter & gamble company is focused on providing branded products of superior quality and
value to improve the lives of the worlds consumers. the company was incorporated in ohio in 1905,
having been built from a business founded in 1837 by william procter and james gamble. today, we
market over 300 branded products in more than 160 countries. unless the context indicates
otherwise, the terms the company, p&g, we, our or us as used herein refers to the procter
& gamble company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.
the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. our products compete
against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global
competitors. we market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build
awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. we believe this combination
provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. product quality,
performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.
throughout this form 10-k, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed
with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
the companys annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports
on form 8-k are filed electronically with the sec. the sec maintains an internet site that contains
these reports at: http://www.sec.gov. you can also access these reports through links from our
website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.jhtml.
copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting the procter & gamble
company, shareholder services department, p.o. box 5572, cincinnati, ohio 45201-5572.
financial information about segments
the company is organized into three global business units: p&g beauty; p&g family health; and
p&g household care. we have five reportable segments under u.s. gaap: p&g beauty; health care; baby
care and family care; fabric care and home care; and snacks and coffee. none of these businesses is
highly seasonal. many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are
similar. operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to nature of the
materials and processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses
and differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales. net
sales growth by business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the
markets of each business and products. for example, we expect our p&g beauty business to provide a
disproportionate percentage of overall net sales growth, as the market for these products is
expected to grow at a higher rate than the remaining businesses.
table of contents
additional information about our businesses, including a discussion of competitive conditions,
can be found in managements discussion and analysis, pages 27-28, and note 11, segment
information, which appears on pages 60-61 of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year
ended june30, 2005.
effective july1, 2004, we realigned some of our business units and associated management
responsibilities. concurrent with this change, we made adjustments to the measures used to
evaluate the performance of senior management. the most significant of these adjustments was the
amortization expense of identifiable intangible assets with determinable lives, which is now
included in business results rather than held in corporate. while these changes had no impact on
total company results, historical business results for all periods presented were conformed for
these changes.
narrative description of business
business model. our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing
brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. the markets and industry segments in
which we offer our products are highly competitive. our products are sold in over 160 countries
around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores and
drug stores. we have also expanded our presence in high-frequency stores, the neighborhood stores
which serve many consumers in developing markets. we work collaboratively with our customers to
improve the in-store presence of our products and win the first moment of truth  when a consumer
is shopping in the store. we must also win the second moment of truth  when a consumer uses the
product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value. we
believe we must continue to provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order
to grow our business. research and product development activities, designed to enable
sustained organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. while
many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these
activities demonstrate our commitment to future growth.
key product categories. we currently have three product categories that each account for 10%
or more of consolidated net sales. the laundry category constitutes approximately 17% of net sales
for fiscal year 2005, compared to 18% of net sales for fiscal year 2004 and 19% in 2003. the diaper
category represents approximately 11% of net sales in 2005, compared to 11% in 2004 and 12% in
2003. the retail hair care category accounts for approximately 10% of fiscal year 2005 net sales
compared to 11% of fiscal year 2004 net sales and 9% in 2003.
key customers. our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club
stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. sales to wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates
represent approximately 16% of our total revenue, compared to 17% in 2004 and 18% in 2003. no
other customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. our top ten customers account for
approximately 32% of total unit volume, which is comparable with 2004 and 2003. the nature of our
business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. we believe our
practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent with the
industry segments in which we compete.
table of contents
sources and availability of materials. almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by
the company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. we produce raw
materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. in addition, fuel and
natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks used to deliver our
products to customers. the prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to
fluctuation. for example, the price of oil was up approximately 45% in 2005 compared to the prior
year. the cost of many of the resins used in our raw and packaging materials increased about 20%.
we also had increases in pulp and chemical costs. when prices for these items change, we may or may
not pass on the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the
change. in 2005, we increased prices in some categories, including family care, pet health and
nutrition, coffee and certain fabric care markets to recover increases in commodity costs. the
company purchases a substantial variety of raw and packaging materials, no one of which is material
to our business taken as a whole.
trademarks and patents. we own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which
are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. some of these patents or licenses cover
significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. the trademarks of
all major products in each business are registered. in part, our success can be attributed to the
existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.
expenditures for environmental compliance. expenditures for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not
material to the company. no material change is expected in fiscal year 2006.
employees. the company has approximately 110,000 employees.
financial information about foreign and domestic operations
net sales in the united states account for approximately 45% of total net sales. no other
individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. operations outside the united
states are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the
business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values,
different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and
disruptions. our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended june30 were as follows:
north america

development of the business
the discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including
the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over the past five years.
gillette acquistion. on january27, 2005, we entered into an agreement to acquire the gillette
company. the agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors and the shareholders of
both companies, provides for a stock-for-stock exchange in which 0.975 shares of the procter &
gamble company common stock will be issued and exchanged, on a tax-free basis, for each share of
the gillette company. under the purchase method of accounting, the total consideration would be
approximately $54billion, determined using the average company stock prices beginning two days
before and ending two days after january28, 2005, the date the acquisition was announced.
the gillette company is the world leader in the male grooming category that includes blades,
razors and shaving preparations, and in selected female grooming products. gillette also holds the
number one position worldwide in alkaline batteries and toothbrushes. total sales for gillette
during its most recent year ended december31, 2004 were $10.5billion.
the acquisition is subject to approval by us and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. we believe
that the transaction will close in fall 2005.
juice divestiture. in august2004 the company completed the divestiture of its juice business.
wella acquisition. in march2003, the company entered into an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in wella from the majority shareholders. in september2003, we completed this
purchase of the shares of wella for eur 3.16billion (approximately $3.42billion based on exchange
rates on that date). additionally, in september2003, we purchased shares secured through a tender
offer to remaining shareholders for eur 1.49billion (approximately $1.67billion based on exchange
rates on that date). as a result of these purchases, the company acquired approximately 81% of the
outstanding wella shares (99% of the voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares).
in june2004, the company and wella entered into a domination and profit transfer agreement
(the domination agreement). under the domination agreement, we are entitled to exercise full
operating control and receive 100% of the future earnings of wella. as consideration for the
domination agreement, we will pay the remaining shareholders of wella a guaranteed annual dividend
payment. alternatively, the remaining wella shareholders may elect to tender their shares to the
company for an agreed price. the fair value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments was
$1.11billion, which is the approximate cost if all remaining shares were tendered.
table of contents
the acquisition of wella was financed by a mixture of available cash balances and debt. wella
is a leading beauty care company selling its products in more than 150 countries, focused on
professional hair care, retail hair care and cosmetics and fragrances.
hutchison acquisition. in june2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our china venture
from our partner, hutchison whampoa china ltd. (hutchison), giving us full ownership of our
operations in china. the net purchase price was $1.85billion, which is the purchase price of $2.00
billion net of minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of the
transaction. the acquisition was funded by debt.
jif/crisco spin-off. during may2002, we completed the spin-off of the jif peanut butter and
crisco shortening brands to the companys shareholders and their subsequent merger into the j.m.
smucker company.
clairol acquisition. in november2001, we completed the acquisition of the clairol business
from the bristol-myers squibb company.
restructuring program. in 1999, we announced our intention to transition from our previous
geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit structure. concurrent with that
change, we initiated a multi-year organization 2005 restructuring program. the program was designed
to accelerate growth and deliver cost reductions by streamlining management decision making,
manufacturing and other work processes and discontinuing under-performing businesses and
initiatives. this restructuring program was substantially complete by the end of 2003. from the
programs inception through the end of 2003, we incurred charges of $4.85billion before tax ($3.79
billion after tax) for employee separation costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation and
other costs directly related to the restructuring effort.
item2. properties.
in the united states, we own and operate 33 manufacturing facilities located in 21 different
states. in addition, we own and operate 91 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. many
of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. p&g beauty
products are manufactured at 53 of these locations; fabric care and home care products at 42; baby
care and family care products at 32; health care products at 27; and snacks and coffee products at
6. management believes that the companys production facilities are adequate to support the
business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.
item3. legal proceedings.
we are involved in clean-up efforts at off-site superfund locations, many of which are in the
preliminary stages of investigation. the amount accrued at the end of june30, 2005, representing
probable future costs that can be reasonably estimated, was $7million.
we are also involved in certain other environmental proceedings. no such proceeding is
expected to result in material monetary or other sanctions being imposed by any governmental
entity, or in other material liabilities.

item4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders.

table of contents
the company has made certain forward-looking statements in the annual report to shareholders
for the fiscal year ended june30, 2005 and in other contexts relating to volume and net sales
growth, increases in market shares, financial goals and cost reduction, among others.
these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates regarding competitive
activity, pricing, product introductions, economic conditions, customer and consumer trends,
technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action and the development of certain
markets available at the time the statements are made. among the key factors that could impact
results and must be managed by the company are:
(1)
the ability to achieve business plans, including with respect to lower income
consumers and growing existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of
competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and
geographical markets (including developing markets) in which the company has chosen to
focus;
(2)
the ability to successfully execute, manage and integrate key acquisitions and
mergers, including (i)the domination and profit transfer agreement with wella, and
(ii)the companys agreement to merge with the gillette company, including obtaining
the related required regulatory approvals;
(3)
the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships;
(4)
the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole
supplier and plant manufacturing sources);
(5)
the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including
product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve
pending matters within current estimates;
(6)
the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement
plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including the companys outsourcing
projects;
(7)
the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in
volatile countries), debt (including debt related to the companys announced plan to
repurchase shares of the companys stock), interest rate and certain commodity cost
exposures;
(8)
the ability to manage the continued global political and/or economic
uncertainty and disruptions, especially in the companys significant geographical
markets, as well as any political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions due to
terrorist activities;
(9)
the ability to successfully manage competitive factors, including prices,
promotional incentives and trade terms for products;
(10)
the ability to obtain patents and respond to technological advances attained by
competitors and patents granted to competitors;
(11)
the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials
used to make the companys products;
(12)
the ability to stay close to consumers in an era of increased media fragmentation; and
(13)
the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation.
if the companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the
company does not achieve all of these key factors, then our actual results might differ materially
from the forward-looking statements made herein.

item9a. controls and procedures.
the companys chairman of the board, president and chief executive, a.g. lafley, and the
companys chief financial officer, clayton c. daley, jr., have evaluated the companys internal
control and disclosure control systems as of the end of the period covered by this report.
messrs.lafley and daley have concluded that the companys disclosure control systems are
functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the company can meet its disclosure
obligations. the companys disclosure control system is based upon a global chain of financial,
staff and general business reporting lines that converge in the worldwide headquarters of the
company in cincinnati, ohio. the reporting process is designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits with the commission is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions
rules and forms. consistent with the secs suggestion, the company has formed a disclosure
committee consisting of key company personnel designed to review the accuracy and completeness of
all disclosures made by the company.
in connection with the evaluation described above, no changes in the companys internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the companys fourth fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control
over financial reporting.

the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan (belgian version)
effective february14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the procter & gamble
1992 stock plan (belgian version). although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for
approval, the plan is nearly identical to the procter & gamble 1992 stock plan, approved by the
companys shareholders on october13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with
the belgian tax laws. although no further grants can be made under the plan, unexercised stock
options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding.
the plan is a stock incentive plan designed to attract, retain and motivate key belgian
employees. under the plan, eligible participants may be granted or offered the right to purchase
stock options, may be granted stock appreciation rights and/or may be granted shares of the
companys common stock. except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock
appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no
later than fifteen years from the date of grant. the exercise price for all stock options granted
under the plan is the average price of the companys stock on the date of grant. if a recipient of
a grant leaves the company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions
immediately become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void
within one month of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. any common stock awarded
under the plan may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed,
as the committee administering the plan may determine.
the procter & gamble future shares plan
on october14, 1997, the companys board of directors approved the procter & gamble future
shares plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the companys common stock may be
granted to employees worldwide. the purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the
company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the companys future growth and success
and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the companys shareholders
through increased ownership of shares of the companys stock. the plan has not been submitted to
shareholders for approval.
subject to adjustment for changes in the companys capitalization, the number of shares to be
granted under the plan is not to exceed 17million shares. under the plans regulations,
recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the companys common stock at an exercise
price equal to the average price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant. these
options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant.
if a recipient leaves the employ of the company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than
disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.
at the time of the first grant following approval of the plan, each employee of the company
not eligible for an award under the 1992 stock plan was granted options for 100 shares. since the
date of the first grant, each new employee of the company has also received options for 100 shares.
following the grant of options on june30, 2003, the company suspended this part of the plan and
intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan.
in addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares are granted to
approximately 2,000 employees who are not eligible for participation in the 2001 stock and
incentive compensation plan in recognition of outstanding performance.
