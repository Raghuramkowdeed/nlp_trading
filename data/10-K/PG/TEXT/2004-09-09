THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED PRODUCTS OF

SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE WORLDS CONSUMERS. THE

COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS

FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE MARKET OVER 300

BRANDED PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 160 COUNTRIES. UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES

OTHERWISE, THE TERMS THE COMPANY, WE, OUR OR US AS USED HEREIN REFERS

TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS IN FIVE PRODUCT SEGMENTS: FABRIC AND HOME

CARE; BABY AND FAMILY CARE; BEAUTY CARE; HEALTH CARE; AND SNACKS AND BEVERAGES.

NONE OF THESE SEGMENTS IS HIGHLY SEASONAL. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN

UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FIVE SEGMENTS ARE SIMILAR. OPERATING MARGINS OF THE

INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO NATURE OF THE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES

USED TO MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND

DIFFERENCES IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES. NET SALES GROWTH BY SEGMENT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO

THE UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS OF EACH SEGMENTS PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE EXPECT THE BEAUTY CARE AND HEALTH CARE SEGMENTS TO PROVIDE A

DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL COMPANY NET SALES GROWTH, AS THE MARKET

FOR THESE PRODUCTS IS EXPECTED TO GROW AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE REMAINING

SEGMENTS.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THE

PRODUCTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE

AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN GLOBAL COMPETITORS. WE MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO BUILD AWARENESS OF

OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS

COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF

PRODUCTS. PRODUCT QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM

OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q

AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC. THE SEC

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND

SUCCESS OF EXISTING BRANDS AND PRODUCTS AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE

MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE

PRESENCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN A CONSUMER

IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE. WE MUST ALSO WIN THE SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTH  WHEN

A CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS

AND WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD VALUE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW,

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND BRANDING TO THE CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.

BASIC RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO ENABLE SUSTAINED

ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.

WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE

YEARS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE ITS COMMITMENT TO

FUTURE GROWTH.

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT

EACH ACCOUNT FOR 10% OR MORE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY

CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 18% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004, COMPARED TO

19% IN 2003 AND 19% IN 2002. THE DIAPER CATEGORY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 11%

OF CONSOLIDATED SALES IN 2004, COMPARED TO 12% IN 2003 AND 2002. THE RETAIL

HAIR CARE CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11% OF FISCAL YEAR 2004 NET

SALES, UP FROM JUST OVER 9% IN 2003 AND 2002. THE INCREASE IN HAIR CARE

CATEGORY SALES IS DUE, IN PART, TO THE ADDITION OF WELLA AG (WELLA).

KEY CUSTOMERS.

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES,

MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES AND DRUG STORES. SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS

AFFILIATES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE, COMPARED TO 18% IN

2003 AND 17% IN 2002. NO OTHER CUSTOMER REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET

SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 33% OF TOTAL UNIT

VOLUME, COMPARED TO 33% IN 2003 AND 35% IN 2002. THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WE

BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS FOR CUSTOMERS AND

SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS.

ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING

MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE

SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. SOME RAW MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, ARE PRODUCED

BY THE COMPANY FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, FUEL

AND NATURAL GAS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES USED IN OUR PLANTS AND IN THE TRUCKS

USED TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND

OTHER COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION. WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS

CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS ON THE CHANGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS DEPENDING ON THE

MAGNITUDE AND EXPECTED DURATION OF THE CHANGE. WE HAVE, HOWEVER, RECENTLY

ANNOUNCED PRICE INCREASES IN SOME CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TISSUE, COFFEE AND PET

HEALTH AND NUTRITION, TO RECOVER INCREASES IN COMMODITY COSTS. THE COMPANY

PURCHASES AND PRODUCES A SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NO

ONE OF WHICH IS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS.

WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND

REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS IN ALL

SEGMENTS. SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT

FORMULATION AND PROCESSING OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. THE TRADEMARKS OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS IN EACH SEGMENT ARE

REGISTERED. IN PART, THE

EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE

WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY

CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL

CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

EMPLOYEES.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 110,000 EMPLOYEES. THE INCREASE

OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE ADDITION OF WELLA.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 46% OF TOTAL NET

SALES. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY HAD NET SALES EXCEEDING 10% OF TOTAL NET

SALES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE

SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES, DIFFERENT

RATES OF INFLATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES

AND DISRUPTIONS. COMPANY SALES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OVER

THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

WELLA.

IN MARCH 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A

CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA FROM THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS. IN SEPTEMBER

2003, WE COMPLETED THIS PURCHASE OF THE SHARES OF WELLA FOR EUR 3.16 BILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $3.42 BILLION BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES ON THAT DATE).

ADDITIONALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2003, WE PURCHASED SHARES SECURED

THROUGH A TENDER OFFER TO REMAINING SHAREHOLDERS FOR EUR 1.49 BILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $1.67

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BILLION BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES ON THAT DATE). AS A RESULT

OF THESE PURCHASES, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE OUTSTANDING

WELLA SHARES (99% OF THE VOTING CLASS SHARES AND 45% OF THE PREFERENCE SHARES).

IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY AND WELLA ENTERED INTO A DOMINATION AND PROFIT

TRANSFER AGREEMENT (THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT). UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT,

WE ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE FULL OPERATING CONTROL AND RECEIVE 100% OF THE

FUTURE EARNINGS OF WELLA. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE

WILL PAY THE HOLDERS OF THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING SHARES OF WELLA A GUARANTEED

ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT. ALTERNATIVELY, THE REMAINING WELLA SHAREHOLDERS MAY

ELECT TO TENDER THEIR SHARES TO THE COMPANY FOR AN AGREED PRICE. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE TOTAL GUARANTEED ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS $1.11 BILLION, WHICH

IS THE APPROXIMATE COST IF ALL REMAINING SHARES WERE TENDERED.

THE ACQUISITION OF WELLA WAS FINANCED BY A MIXTURE OF AVAILABLE CASH

BALANCES AND DEBT. WELLA IS A LEADING BEAUTY CARE COMPANY SELLING ITS PRODUCTS

IN MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES, FOCUSED ON PROFESSIONAL HAIR CARE, RETAIL HAIR CARE

AND COSMETICS AND FRAGRANCES.

HUTCHISON

. IN JUNE 2004, WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 20% STAKE OF OUR

CHINA VENTURE FROM OUR PARTNER, HUTCHISON WHAMPOA CHINA LTD. (HUTCHISON),

GIVING THE COMPANY FULL OWNERSHIP OF OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA. THE NET PURCHASE

PRICE WAS $1.85 BILLION, WHICH IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $2.00 BILLION NET OF

MINORITY INTEREST AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF

THE TRANSACTION. THE ACQUISITION WAS FUNDED BY DEBT.

JIF/CRISCO.

DURING MAY 2002, WE COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF THE JIF PEANUT

BUTTER AND CRISCO SHORTENING BRANDS TO THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR

SUBSEQUENT MERGER INTO THE J.M. SMUCKER COMPANY.

CLAIROL.

IN NOVEMBER 2001, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE CLAIROL

BUSINESS FROM THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO

TRANSITION FROM ITS PREVIOUS GEOGRAPHIC-BASED STRUCTURE TO A PRODUCT-BASED

GLOBAL BUSINESS UNIT STRUCTURE. CONCURRENT WITH THAT CHANGE, WE INITIATED A

MULTI-YEAR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, A DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN

BY REFERENCE TO NOTE 2, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGE 52 OF THE

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2004.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY OWNS AND OPERATES 37 MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES LOCATED IN 21 DIFFERENT STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OWNS AND

OPERATES 99 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 42 OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY OF THE

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. FABRIC AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AT 43 OF THESE LOCATIONS;

BABY AND FAMILY CARE PRODUCTS AT 31; HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 22; BEAUTY CARE

PRODUCTS AT 64; AND SNACKS AND BEVERAGES PRODUCTS AT 11. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESS

EFFICIENTLY AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AT OFF-SITE SUPERFUND

LOCATIONS, MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF INVESTIGATION. THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED AT THE END OF JUNE 30, 2004, REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS PROBABLE

FUTURE COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, WAS $8 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN CERTAIN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS.

NO SUCH PROCEEDING IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN MATERIAL MONETARY OR OTHER

SANCTIONS BEING IMPOSED BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, OR IN OTHER MATERIAL

LIABILITIES. IN 2003 AND THEREAFTER, THE FOLGER COFFEE COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY

OF THE COMPANY, VOLUNTARILY CONTACTED THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

QUALITY (LDEQ) CONCERNING COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN AIR EMISSION PERMIT

REQUIREMENTS AT ITS NEW ORLEANS COFFEE PROCESSING PLANT. AS A RESULT OF THESE

SELF-DISCLOSURES, THE SUBSIDIARY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FROM THE LDEQ AN

ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER ON CONSENT AND ANTICIPATES NEGOTIATING AN AGREED PENALTY

WITH THE AGENCY TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES. NO JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IS PENDING.

THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS ESTIMATED NOT TO EXCEED $260,000.

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND DISCRETIONARY REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 65-66 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2004.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THE ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2004 AND IN OTHER

CONTEXTS RELATING TO VOLUME AND NET SALES GROWTH, INCREASES IN MARKET SHARES,

FINANCIAL GOALS AND COST REDUCTION, AMONG OTHERS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES

REGARDING COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, PRICING, PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER TRENDS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, CURRENCY

MOVEMENTS, GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN MARKETS AVAILABLE

AT THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. AMONG THE KEY FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT

RESULTS AND MUST BE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ARE.

(1)

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS PLANS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT

TO LOWER INCOME CONSUMERS AND GROWING EXISTING SALES AND VOLUME

PROFITABLY DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY, ESPECIALLY

WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS

(INCLUDING DEVELOPING MARKETS) IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO

FOCUS;

(2)

SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING, MANAGING AND INTEGRATING KEY

ACQUISITIONS (INCLUDING THE DOMINATION AND PROFIT TRANSFER AGREEMENT

WITH WELLA);

(3)

THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AND MAINTAIN KEY CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS;

(4)

THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN KEY MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY SOURCES

(INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND PLANT MANUFACTURING SOURCES);

(5)

THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL

MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS), AND TO RESOLVE

PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES;

(6)

THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT, ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN

COST IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN MANUFACTURING AND OVERHEAD AREAS,

INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANYS OUTSOURCING PROJECTS;

(7)

THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE CURRENCY (INCLUDING

CURRENCY ISSUES IN VOLATILE COUNTRIES), INTEREST RATE AND CERTAIN

COMMODITY COST EXPOSURES;

(8)

THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND DISRUPTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMPANYS

SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL AND/OR

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND DISRUPTIONS DUE TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES;

(9)

THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF

RAW MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS;

(10)

THE ABILITY TO STAY CLOSE TO CONSUMERS IN AN ERA OF INCREASED

MEDIA FRAGMENTATION; AND

(11)

THE ABILITY TO STAY ON THE LEADING EDGE OF INNOVATION.

IF THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE INCORRECT OR DO NOT COME TO

FRUITION, OR IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF THESE KEY FACTORS, THEN OUR

ACTUAL RESULTS MIGHT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE

HEREIN.

THE COMPANYS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE, A.G.

LAFLEY, AND THE COMPANYS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CLAYTON C. DALEY, JR., HAVE

EVALUATED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL AND DISCLOSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS AS OF

THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.

MESSRS. LAFLEY AND DALEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE

CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY CAN MEET ITS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE

CONTROL SYSTEM IS BASED UPON A GLOBAL CHAIN OF FINANCIAL, STAFF AND GENERAL

BUSINESS REPORTING LINES THAT CONVERGE IN THE WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS OF THE

COMPANY IN CINCINNATI, OHIO. THE REPORTING PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT

INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN THE REPORTS THAT IT

FILES OR SUBMITS WITH THE COMMISSION IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND

REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE COMMISSIONS RULES AND FORMS.

CONSISTENT WITH SEC SUGGESTION, THE COMPANY HAS FORMED A DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE

CONSISTING OF KEY COMPANY PERSONNEL DESIGNED TO REVIEW THE ACCURACY AND

COMPLETENESS OF ALL DISCLOSURES MADE BY THE COMPANY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVALUATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, NO CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OCCURRED DURING THE

COMPANYS FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY

LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE

PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION). ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT

BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, THE PLAN IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS ON

OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE

BELGIAN TAX LAWS. ALTHOUGH NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN,

UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN

OUTSTANDING.

THE PLAN IS A STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND

MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS MAY BE

GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, MAY BE GRANTED STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR MAY BE GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT

AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE

EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE AVERAGE

PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT

LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY

UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH,

AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH OF DEPARTURE, EXCEPT

IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN

MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS

EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER

& GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF

THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS AND TO

STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS

SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE

PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE

NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION

SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS, RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO

ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT.

THESE OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS

FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR

SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH

EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS

GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. SINCE THE DATE OF THE FIRST GRANT, EACH NEW

EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FOLLOWING THE

GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30, 2003, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN

AND INTENDS TO MAKE NO FURTHER GRANTS UNDER THIS PART OF THE PLAN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE GRANTS ABOVE, ANNUAL GRANTS OF OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES

PARTICIPATION IN THE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN RECOGNITION

OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE.
