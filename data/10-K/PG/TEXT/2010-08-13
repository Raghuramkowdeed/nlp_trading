ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS ITEM IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE TO MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A),

WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 31-50; NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 55-57; AND NOTE 11, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEARS ON PAGES 71-72 OF THE 2010 ANNUAL REPORT. UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE

TERMS THE COMPANY, P&G, WE, OUR OR US AS USED HEREIN REFERS TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY (THE REGISTRANT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING BRANDED CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS OF SUPERIOR QUALITY AND VALUE TO IMPROVE

THE LIVES OF THE WORLDS CONSUMERS. THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN OHIO IN 1905, HAVING BEEN BUILT FROM A BUSINESS FOUNDED IN 1837 BY WILLIAM PROCTER AND JAMES GAMBLE. TODAY, WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES.

THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 10-K, WE INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC).

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K ARE

FILED ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC. THE SEC MAINTAINS AN INTERNET SITE THAT CONTAINS THESE REPORTS AT: HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV. YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS THESE REPORTS THROUGH LINKS FROM OUR WEBSITE AT: WWW.PG.COM/INVESTORS/SECTIONMAIN.SHTML.

COPIES OF THESE REPORTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE, WITHOUT CHARGE, BY CONTACTING THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, SHAREHOLDER SERVICES

DEPARTMENT, P.O. BOX 5572, CINCINNATI, OHIO 45201-5572.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED INTO THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS (GBUS): BEAUTY AND GROOMING; HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING; AND HOUSEHOLD CARE. WE HAD SIX REPORTABLE SEGMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP: BEAUTY; GROOMING; HEALTH CARE; SNACKS AND PET CARE; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE; AND BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE. MANY OF THE FACTORS NECESSARY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE

BUSINESSES ARE SIMILAR. OPERATING MARGINS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF MATERIALS AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCTS, THE CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE BUSINESSES AND DIFFERENCES IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. NET SALES GROWTH BY BUSINESS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO VARY SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE UNDERLYING GROWTH OF THE MARKETS OF EACH BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS. WHILE NONE OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE HIGHLY

SEASONAL, COMPONENTS WITHIN CERTAIN OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS BATTERIES (FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE), APPLIANCES (GROOMING) AND PRESTIGE FRAGRANCES (BEAUTY) ARE SEASONAL. IN ADDITION, ANTICIPATION OR OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS

HURRICANES, CAN DRIVE UNUSUALLY HIGH DEMAND FOR BATTERIES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN

MD&A AND NOTE 11, SEGMENT INFORMATION, WHICH APPEAR ON PAGES 31-50 AND 71-72, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE 2010 ANNUAL REPORT.

NARRATIVE

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BUSINESS MODEL

. OUR BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF EXISTING

BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. MANY OF THE PRODUCT SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY PRICE (REFERRED TO AS

SUPER-PREMIUM, PREMIUM, MID-TIER VALUE AND LOW-TIER ECONOMY PRODUCTS). GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE COMPETE WITH SUPER-PREMIUM, PREMIUM AND MID-TIER VALUE PRODUCTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD PRIMARILY THROUGH MASS

MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES AND IN HIGH-FREQUENCY STORES, THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES WHICH SERVE MANY CONSUMERS IN DEVELOPING

2

MARKETS. WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE THE IN-STORE PRESENCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND WIN THE FIRST MOMENT OF TRUTHWHEN A CONSUMER IS SHOPPING IN THE STORE.

WE MUST ALSO WIN THE SECOND MOMENT OF TRUTHWHEN A CONSUMER USES THE PRODUCT, EVALUATES HOW WELL IT MET HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD VALUE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE NEW, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND

BRANDING TO THE CONSUMER IN ORDER TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, DESIGNED TO ENABLE SUSTAINED ORGANIC GROWTH, CONTINUED TO CARRY A HIGH PRIORITY DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR. WHILE MANY OF THE BENEFITS FROM THESE

EFFORTS WILL NOT BE REALIZED UNTIL FUTURE YEARS, WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO FUTURE GROWTH.

KEY PRODUCT CATEGORIES

. IN 2010, TWO PRODUCT CATEGORIES ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE LAUNDRY CATEGORY

CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 17% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009 AND 2008. THE DIAPER CATEGORY CONSTITUTED APPROXIMATELY 11% OF NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009 AND 10% IN 2008.

KEY CUSTOMERS

. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MASS MERCHANDISERS, GROCERY STORES, MEMBERSHIP CLUB STORES, DRUG STORES AND HIGH-FREQUENCY

STORES. SALES TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008. NO OTHER CUSTOMER REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 32% OF

OUR TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2010, COMPARED TO 30% OF TOTAL UNIT VOLUME IN 2009 AND 31% IN 2008. THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS RESULTS IN NO MATERIAL BACKLOG ORDERS OR CONTRACTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE OUR PRACTICES RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS

FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF

MATERIALS

. ALMOST ALL OF THE RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE PURCHASED FROM OTHERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE SINGLE-SOURCE SUPPLIERS. WE PRODUCE RAW MATERIALS, PRIMARILY CHEMICALS, FOR FURTHER USE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN

ADDITION, FUEL, NATURAL GAS AND DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTANT COMMODITIES USED IN OUR PLANTS, PRODUCTS AND IN THE TRUCKS USED TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES WE PAY FOR MATERIALS AND OTHER COMMODITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION.

WHEN PRICES FOR THESE ITEMS CHANGE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT PASS ON THE CHANGE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND EXPECTED DURATION OF THE CHANGE. THE COMPANY PURCHASES A SUBSTANTIAL VARIETY OF OTHER RAW AND PACKAGING MATERIALS, NO ONE OF

WHICH IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

. WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND

REGISTERED TRADEMARKS WHICH ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACTIVITY IN ALL BUSINESSES. SOME OF THESE PATENTS OR LICENSES COVER SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT FORMULATION AND PROCESSES USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS. THE TRADEMARKS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

OVERALL MARKETING AND BRANDING OF OUR PRODUCTS. ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS AND TRADEMARKS IN EACH BUSINESS ARE REGISTERED. IN PART, OUR SUCCESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE AND CONTINUED PROTECTION OF THESE TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES.

COMPETITIVE CONDITION.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE

AGAINST SIMILAR PRODUCTS OF MANY LARGE AND SMALL COMPANIES, INCLUDING WELL-KNOWN GLOBAL COMPETITORS. IN MANY OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER BRANDED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RETAILERS

PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDS. WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATEOFTEN HOLDING A LEADERSHIP OR SIGNIFICANT MARKET SHARE POSITION. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS WITH ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS AND OTHER VEHICLES TO

BUILD AWARENESS OF OUR BRANDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE. WE BELIEVE THIS COMBINATION PROVIDES THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF MARKETING FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. PRODUCT QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, VALUE AND PACKAGING ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ENABLE US TO

DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND OBTAIN PATENTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR CONSUMERS. TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $1,950 MILLION IN 2010, $1,864 MILLION IN 2009 AND $1,946 MILLION IN 2008.

3

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

. EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHANGE IS EXPECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2011.

EMPLOYEES

. TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IS AN ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COMPANY EMPLOYEES EXCLUDING INTERNS, CO-OPS AND EMPLOYEES OF JOINT

VENTURES. HISTORICAL NUMBERS INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 38% OF TOTAL NET SALES. NO OTHER

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY HAD NET SALES EXCEEDING 10% OF TOTAL NET SALES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS ABOVE AND MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL

FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGING CURRENCY VALUES, DIFFERENT RATES OF INFLATION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND DISRUPTIONS. OUR SALES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS

THE DISCUSSION BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITION OF ASSETS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2010.

BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2009,

WE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE OF THE BEAUTY GBU, WHICH RESULTED IN CHANGES TO THE COMPONENTS OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENT STRUCTURE. FEMALE BLADES AND RAZORS WERE FORMERLY INCLUDED IN THE GROOMING REPORTABLE SEGMENT

AND ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE BEAUTY REPORTABLE SEGMENT. CERTAIN MALE-FOCUSED BRANDS AND BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OLD SPICE AND GILLETTE PERSONAL CARE, MOVED FROM THE BEAUTY REPORTABLE SEGMENT TO THE GROOMING REPORTABLE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE BEAUTY GBU

WAS RENAMED THE BEAUTY AND GROOMING GBU. THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN OUR SEGMENT REPORTING FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

PHARMACEUTICALS DIVESTITURE.

ON OCTOBER 30, 2009, WE SOLD OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS TO WARNER CHILCOTT PLC

(WARNER CHILCOTT) FOR $2.8 BILLION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WARNER CHILCOTT ACQUIRED OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCTS, PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRODUCT PIPELINE AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN PUERTO RICO AND GERMANY. THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN PART OF

4

THE HEALTH CARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THE RESULTS OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ARE PRESENTED AS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, ARE EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND FROM SEGMENT RESULTS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

WE DISCUSS OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE, EVENTS AND OUTCOMES, SUCH AS OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN

THIS FORM 10-K, THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. ALL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR HISTORICAL AND PRESENT FACTUAL INFORMATION, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ARE

BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA AND BUSINESS PLANS AVAILABLE ONLY AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, WHICH MAY BECOME OUT OF DATE OR INCOMPLETE. WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE

EVENTS, OR OTHER FACTORS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND INVESTORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MD&A AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE

BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS. THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA

ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY SHIFTING OUR PORTFOLIO TOWARDS FASTER GROWING, HIGHER MARGIN BUSINESSES. IF DEMAND AND GROWTH RATES FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OR OUR MARKET SHARE DECLINES

SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE BUSINESSES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THIS COULD OCCUR DUE TO UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OR TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER TRENDS AND HABITS. IN ADDITION, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON

LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING

COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING,

PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST

PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN

COMMODITY PRICES, RAW MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS, COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING

OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY KEY SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING PLANT

ARRANGEMENTS.

5

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A

NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH MAY REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS RECEIVED AND/OR BALANCES HELD BY OR INVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS

EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LIMITS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT CAN INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE. WE HAVE SIZABLE BUSINESSES AND MAINTAIN LOCAL CURRENCY CASH BALANCES IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITH EXCHANGE

CONTROLS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, VENEZUELA, CHINA AND INDIA. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS IN AN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT.

FURTHER, WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY ACHIEVING DISPROPORTIONATE GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS. SHOULD GROWTH RATES OR OUR MARKET SHARE FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS IN THESE REGIONS, OUR RESULTS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INFLATION, DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO TERRORIST AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

IF THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY OR ONE OR MORE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS ERODES SIGNIFICANTLY, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS REPUTATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER CONSTITUENCIES. IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE REAL OR PERCEIVED ISSUES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT SENTIMENTS TOWARD THE COMPANY, OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE FREELY COULD BE IMPAIRED AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD SUFFER. OUR FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY

DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRANDS, PARTICULARLY OUR BILLION-DOLLAR BRANDS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE BRANDS CAN SUFFER IF OUR MARKETING PLANS OR PRODUCT INITIATIVES DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON A BRANDS IMAGE OR ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT

CONSUMERS. FURTHER, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF ONE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ITS REPUTATION DUE TO REAL OR PERCEIVED QUALITY ISSUES OR THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ADAPT TO ONGOING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

WE HAVE EXECUTED A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND WORKFORCE

OPTIMIZATION PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES. WE EXPECT THESE TYPES OF CHANGES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THESE CHANGES, INCLUDING RETENTION OF KEY EMPLOYEES, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE GENERALLY A BUILD-FROM-WITHIN COMPANY, AND OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON IDENTIFYING, DEVELOPING AND RETAINING KEY EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE UNINTERRUPTED LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION FOR OUR BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING ORGANIZATION

CAPABILITIES IN KEY GROWTH MARKETS WHERE THE DEPTH OF SKILLED EMPLOYEES IS LIMITED AND COMPETITION FOR THESE RESOURCES IS INTENSE. FURTHER, BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN MORE RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES FOR VARIOUS SERVICES, AND

THAT RELIANCE MAY INCREASE COMPLIANCE RISKS, INCLUDING ANTI-CORRUPTION. FINALLY, OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS ASSUME A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS, WHILE CONTINUING TO INVEST

IN BUSINESS GROWTH, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ONGOING ACQUISITION AND

DIVESTITURE ACTIVITIES COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

AS A COMPANY THAT MANAGES A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER BRANDS, OUR

ONGOING BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITIES. WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DELIVERING AGAINST BASE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF: 1) WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS, 2) CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OR OTHER MARKET-BASED ASSUMPTIONS CAUSE THE VALUE OF ACQUIRED

ASSETS TO FALL BELOW BOOK VALUE OR 3) WE ARE UNABLE TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACTS FROM THE LOSS OF REVENUE STREAMS ASSOCIATED WITH DIVESTED BRANDS.

6

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN COMPETITION, PRODUCT-RELATED, PRIVACY AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS,

TAXATION REQUIREMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT PENALTIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS), AND TO RESOLVE PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITHOUT

SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY, INCLUDING THE COMPETITION LAW AND ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT RESERVES IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED TO DATE OR PAY SIGNIFICANT FINES

DURING A REPORTING PERIOD, MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS. IN ADDITION, AS A U.S. BASED MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO TAX REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. AND MULTIPLE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE INTERDEPENDENT. FOR EXAMPLE,

CERTAIN INCOME THAT IS EARNED AND TAXED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS NOT TAXED IN THE U.S., PROVIDED THOSE EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. IF THESE OR OTHER TAX REGULATIONS SHOULD CHANGE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE

IMPACTED.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS.

THIS INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRADE TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS. OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT WITH A KEY CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR TRADE TERMS AND

PRINCIPLES. FURTHER, THERE IS A CONTINUING TREND TOWARDS RETAIL TRADE CONSOLIDATION, WHICH CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST AND MARGIN PRESSURE AND COULD LEAD TO MORE COMPLEX WORK ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES FOR BOTH US AND KEY RETAILERS. THIS

CAN BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WHEN MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE ADDRESSING LOCAL TRADE PRESSURES OR LOCAL LAW AND REGULATION CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF A KEY CUSTOMER WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RANGE OR INVENTORY

LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCTS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BUSINESS IS IMPACTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY VOLATILE. IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY EXPERIENCES

SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED, INCLUDING SUCH AREAS AS REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM A SLOW-DOWN IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY, SUPPLIER OR CUSTOMER DISRUPTIONS RESULTING FROM TIGHTER CREDIT MARKETS AND/OR

TEMPORARY INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT DAY-TO-DAY TRANSACTIONS THROUGH OUR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES INVOLVING THE PAYMENT TO OR COLLECTION OF FUNDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND SUPPLIERS.

A FAILURE OF A KEY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM, PROCESS OR SITE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO

INTERACT WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. THESE INTERACTIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ORDERING AND MANAGING MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, CONVERTING MATERIALS TO FINISHED PRODUCTS, SHIPPING PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERS, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS,

SUMMARIZING AND REPORTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, COMPLYING WITH REGULATORY, LEGAL OR TAX REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER PROCESSES NECESSARY TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS. IF OUR SYSTEMS ARE DAMAGED OR CEASE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY DUE TO ANY NUMBER OF CAUSES,

RANGING FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS TO POWER OUTAGES TO SECURITY BREACHES, AND OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY COMPENSATE ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OPERATIONS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE TRANSITIONING OUR ORDERING, SHIPPING AND BILLING SYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE TO A NEW SYSTEM DURING FISCAL 2011. IF THE NEW SYSTEM DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY UPON

IMPLEMENTATION, OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND DELIVER CUSTOMER ORDERS IN OUR TWO LARGEST REGIONS COULD BE LIMITED AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIOD(S) OF TRANSITION. ALSO, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROCESS AND RECEIVE

PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CASH FLOW RESULTS DURING THOSE PERIODS.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

IN THE U.S., WE OWN AND OPERATE 37 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN 23 DIFFERENT STATES OR TERRITORIES.

IN ADDITION, WE OWN AND OPERATE 97 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 41 OTHER COUNTRIES. MANY OF THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACILITIES PRODUCE PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESSES. BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AT 39 OF THESE LOCATIONS; GROOMING

PRODUCTS AT 14; FABRIC CARE AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS AT 51; BABY CARE AND FAMILY CARE PRODUCTS AT 30; SNACKS AND PET CARE PRODUCTS AT 11; AND HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AT 35. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO

SUPPORT THE BUSINESS EFFICIENTLY AND THAT THE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COVER A

WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS, INCLUDING ANTITRUST AND TRADE REGULATION, PRODUCT LIABILITY, ADVERTISING, CONTRACTS, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, PATENT AND TRADEMARK MATTERS, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS AND TAXES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO POTENTIAL COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN EUROPE. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS

TO COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ALL ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION LAWS, AND TO COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATIONS BY RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WHICH THE COMPANY IS DOING.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS IN EUROPE. IN 2006, FRENCH AUTHORITIES, IN CONNECTION WITH AN INQUIRY INTO

POTENTIAL COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN FRANCE, ENTERED THE PREMISES OF TWO OF THE COMPANYS FRENCH SUBSIDIARIES AND SEIZED A VARIETY OF DOCUMENTS. IN 2008, EUROPEAN COMMISSION OFFICIALS, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES

FROM A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES, STARTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL COMPETITION LAW VIOLATIONS IN A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. AROUND THE SAME TIME, THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IN SPAIN, ITALY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC INITIATED

ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO POTENTIAL ANTITRUST CONCERNS WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS, A NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES WERE VISITED AND DOCUMENTS SEIZED. ALSO IN 2008, AUTHORITIES IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM (UK) INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION CONCERNING POTENTIAL ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS IN THE UK INVOLVING ONE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW INVESTIGATIONS IN

GERMANY, BELGIUM, ROMANIA, SWITZERLAND, FRANCE AND GREECE, AS WELL AS SOME OTHER COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE MATTERS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANIES AND/OR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST LAW

INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND, IF VIOLATIONS ARE FOUND, CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL FINES. IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, FINES HAVE AMOUNTED TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE ACTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED ITS OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO

POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION LAWS. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED VIOLATIONS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN.

DURING THIS FISCAL YEAR, AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND SWITZERLAND HAVE ISSUED COMPLAINTS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY,

ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGED IN VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION LAWS. THE COMPANY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THESE COMPLAINTS. THE REMAINING MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS.

IT IS STILL TOO EARLY FOR US TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FINES TO WHICH THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT AS A RESULT OF THESE

VARIOUS COMPETITION LAW ISSUES. HOWEVER, WE HAVE TAKEN AND WILL TAKE RESERVES AS APPROPRIATE. PLEASE REFER TO THE COMPANYS RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY BECAME AWARE OF AN INVESTIGATION BY ITALIAN AUTHORITIES INTO

AN ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENT AT THE SITE OF A CONTRACTOR WHICH PROVIDES SERVICES TO ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS EUROPEAN AFFILIATES. THE ACCIDENT INVOLVED THE EXPLOSION OF CERTAIN PRESSURIZED CANS AND RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ONE WORKER AND

SERIOUS INJURIES TO ANOTHER. ITALIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE COMMENCED A FORMAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDING REGARDING WHETHER THE COMPANYS LOCAL AFFILIATE AND CERTAIN OF ITS EMPLOYEES COMPLIED WITH ITALIAN LAWS RELATED TO THE PROPER CLASSIFICATION AND

DISPOSAL OF THEIR PRODUCTS. SHOULD THEY FIND THAT THESE ENTITIES VIOLATED THE LAW, THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES COULD LEVY FINES IN EXCESS OF $100 THOUSAND AGAINST THE COMPANYS EUROPEAN AFFILIATE(S).

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN (BELGIAN VERSION)

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON FEBRUARY 14, 1997. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, IT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE PROCTER & GAMBLE 1992 STOCK PLAN, APPROVED BY

THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS ON OCTOBER 13, 1992, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINOR CHANGES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE BELGIAN TAX LAWS.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY BELGIAN EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE: (I) GRANTED

OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II) GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION

RIGHTS MUST VEST IN NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND MUST EXPIRE NO LATER THAN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON

THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT, ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, AND ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS BECOME VOID WITHIN ONE MONTH

OF DEPARTURE, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OR RETIREMENT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER THE PLAN MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PROCTER & GAMBLE FUTURE SHARES PLAN PURSUANT TO

WHICH OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN IS TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY BY GIVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES A STAKE IN THE COMPANYS FUTURE

GROWTH AND SUCCESS AND TO STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH INCREASED OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. THE PLAN HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL.

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS

NOT TO EXCEED 17 MILLION SHARES. UNDER THE PLANS REGULATIONS, RECIPIENTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 100 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON

THE DATE OF THE GRANT. THESE OPTIONS VEST FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE FOR A REASON OTHER THAN DISABILITY, RETIREMENT

OR SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN), THEN THE AWARD IS FORFEITED.

AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST GRANT FOLLOWING

BOARD APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AN AWARD UNDER THE 1992 STOCK PLAN WAS GRANTED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES. FROM THE DATE OF THIS FIRST GRANT THROUGH JUNE 30, 2003, EACH NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO

RECEIVED OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES.

FOLLOWING THE GRANT OF OPTIONS ON JUNE 30, 2003, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED THIS PART OF THE PLAN AND INTENDS TO MAKE NO FURTHER GRANTS UNDER THIS PART OF THE PLAN.

THE PLAN TERMINATED ON

OCTOBER 13, 2007.

14

IN ADDITION TO THE GRANTS ABOVE, ANNUAL GRANTS OF OPTIONS FOR 100 SHARES ARE GRANTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 2001 STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IN RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS KEY MANAGERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH GRANTS.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 1971 STOCK OPTION PLAN

NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE PLAN AFTER APRIL 25, 2005, ALTHOUGH UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THIS

PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THE PLAN WAS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND

EXERCISABLE ON OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF .975 SHARES OF P&G STOCK PER

SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY

AND NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE COMPANY STOCK AT A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE WHICH CANNOT BE LESS THAN 100% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE PER SHARE AT THE TIME THAT THE

OPTION IS GRANTED. THE PERIOD OF ANY OPTION MAY NOT EXCEED TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN WAS NOT TO EXCEED 198,000,000 SHARES.

IF A RECIPIENT LEAVES THE EMPLOY OF THE COMPANY FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DEATH OR DISCHARGE FOR CAUSE, THE RECIPIENT IS

PERMITTED TO EXERCISE ANY VESTED OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN FOR A PERIOD BETWEEN THIRTY DAYS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER TERMINATION, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS/HER DEPARTURE. IF A PARTICIPANT IS DISCHARGED FOR CAUSE, ALL OPTIONS ARE

IMMEDIATELY CANCELLED. IF A PARTICIPANT DIES WHILE HOLDING OPTIONS, THE OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE TO THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN ALLOWS GILLETTE EMPLOYEES WHOSE EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED FOR

GOOD REASON WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE REMAINING OPTIONS FOR THE SHORTER OF FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THEIR TERMINATION DATE OR THE ORIGINAL LIFE OF THE GRANT. EMPLOYEES TERMINATED FOR

GOOD REASON WHO ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE UNDER A COMPANY PLAN ARE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS SUBJECT TO THE ORIGINAL TERMS OF THE GRANT.

THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY APPROVED THE GILLETTE COMPANY 2004 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN ON MAY 20, 2004, AND THE PLAN WAS

ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND THE GILLETTE COMPANY. ALL OPTIONS BECAME IMMEDIATELY VESTED AND EXERCISABLE ON OCTOBER 1, 2005 AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. AFTER THE MERGER, ALL OUTSTANDING

OPTIONS BECAME OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY SUBJECT TO AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF .975 SHARES OF P&G STOCK PER SHARE OF GILLETTE STOCK. ONLY EMPLOYEES PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY THE GILLETTE COMPANY PRIOR TO

OCTOBER 1, 2005 ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS UNDER THIS PLAN.

THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE

EMPLOYEES OF THE GILLETTE COMPANY, AND UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MERGER BETWEEN THE GILLETTE COMPANY AND THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF THE GILLETTE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER THE PLAN, ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS ARE.

(I) GRANTED OR OFFERED THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK OPTIONS, (II) GRANTED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND/OR (III) GRANTED SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS). SUBJECT TO

ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION AND THE ADDITION OF ANY SHARES AUTHORIZED BUT NOT ISSUED OR REDEEMED UNDER THE GILLETTE COMPANY 1971 STOCK OPTION PLAN, THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN IS NOT TO EXCEED

19,000,000 SHARES.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT, ALL STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS MUST EXPIRE

NO LATER THAN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. ANY COMMON STOCK AWARDED UNDER

THE PLAN MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OR TRANSFER WHILE THE RECIPIENT IS EMPLOYED, AS THE COMMITTEE ADMINISTERING THE PLAN MAY DETERMINE.

15

IF A RECIPIENT OF A GRANT LEAVES THE COMPANY WHILE HOLDING AN UNEXERCISED OPTION OR RIGHT.

(1) ANY UNEXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, RETIREMENT, SPECIAL SEPARATION (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE PLAN) OR ANY GRANTS AS TO WHICH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS

WAIVED THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS; AND (2) ANY EXERCISABLE PORTIONS IMMEDIATELY BECOME VOID, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH, RETIREMENT, SPECIAL SEPARATION, VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION THAT IS NOT FOR GOOD REASON (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE PLAN)

OR ANY GRANTS AS TO WHICH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS WAIVED THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS.
