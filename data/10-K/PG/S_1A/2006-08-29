WHAT WE

BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE

FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

AND FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND

PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS

AND RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS. THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE AND MAINTAIN KEY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES,

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION,

OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND

OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS

THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL

AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE

ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS

THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS

GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY GILLETTE, COULD IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS RESULTS.

SINCE OUR GOALS INCLUDE A GROWTH COMPONENT TIED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION TO OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND EXECUTE BUSINESS PLANS ON OUR BASE BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE

EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW

MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. OUR COSTS IN 2006 WERE IMPACTED BY

HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 2007. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS,

COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND CERTAIN HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING PLANT

ARRANGEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. ECONOMIC CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION, INFLATION, DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND

IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY,

ESPECIALLY

IN OUR SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO

TERRORIST AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED

LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAXATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS AS WELL AS THOSE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF GILLETTE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.
