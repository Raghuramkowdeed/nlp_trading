RISK FACTORS.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS FORM 10-K, THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) AND

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE

BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD

CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FROM HISTORICAL

TRENDS.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS.

WE ARE A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND RELY ON CONTINUED GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR BRANDS AND

PRODUCTS. TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS, WE MUST DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO CONSUMERS.

THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SALES,

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS IN AN INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT TO

ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY SHIFTING OUR PORTFOLIO TOWARDS FASTER GROWING, HIGHER

MARGIN BUSINESSES. IF DEMAND AND GROWTH RATES FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS OR OUR

MARKET SHARE DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THESE BUSINESSES, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THIS COULD OCCUR DUE TO UNFORESEEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OR TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER

TRENDS AND HABITS. IN ADDITION, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON LEADING-EDGE INNOVATION,

WITH RESPECT TO BOTH PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THIS MEANS WE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS THAT

LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO OUR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE WORLD.

THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE CAN RESPOND TO OUR LOCAL

AND GLOBAL COMPETITORS.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR CATEGORIES, WE COMPETE AGAINST A WIDE VARIETY OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE ONGOING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT AND PRICING PRESSURES IN THE

ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFIT MARGINS. TO ADDRESS

THESE CHALLENGES, WE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

PRICING, PROMOTIONAL INCENTIVES AND TRADE TERMS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PATENTS

GRANTED TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY GILLETTE, COULD IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS RESULTS.

SINCE OUR GOALS INCLUDE A GROWTH COMPONENT TIED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND INTEGRATE KEY ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ACQUISITION OF THE GILLETTE

COMPANY. SPECIFICALLY, WE MUST BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION TO OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND EXECUTE BUSINESS PLANS ON OUR BASE BUSINESSES. IN

ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE

EXPECTED COST AND GROWTH SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES FACE COST PRESSURES WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS RESULTS.

OUR COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, RAW

MATERIALS, COST OF LABOR, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. OUR COSTS IN 2007 WERE IMPACTED BY

HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS AND THIS TREND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN 2008. THEREFORE, OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH PRICING ACTIONS,

COST SAVINGS PROJECTS (INCLUDING OUTSOURCING PROJECTS), SOURCING DECISIONS AND

CERTAIN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. IN THE MANUFACTURING AND GENERAL

OVERHEAD AREAS, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN KEY

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SOLE SUPPLIER AND SOLE MANUFACTURING

PLANT ARRANGEMENTS.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS, IN PART, BY ACHIEVING DISPROPORTIONATE

GROWTH IN DEVELOPING REGIONS. SHOULD GROWTH RATES OR OUR MARKET SHARE FALL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW

EXPECTED LEVELS IN THESE REGIONS, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC

CHANGES, TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND POLITICAL UNREST MAY RESULT IN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INFLATION,

DEFLATION OR DECREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE CONTINUED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND/OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY IN OUR SIGNIFICANT

GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS ANY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION DUE TO TERRORIST AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTIVITIES.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THE RELATED INTERPRETATIONS MAY ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL, COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCT-RELATED

LAWS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND TAXATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

ABILITY TO MANAGE REGULATORY, TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS (INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT, AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS AS WELL AS THOSE RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION OF GILLETTE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) AND TO RESOLVE PENDING MATTERS WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

IF THE REPUTATION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS ERODES SIGNIFICANTLY, IT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR COMPANYS FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR BRANDS,

PARTICULARLY OUR BILLION-DOLLAR BRANDS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE BRANDS CAN SUFFER IF OUR MARKETING

PLANS OR PRODUCT INITIATIVES DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON A BRANDS IMAGE OR ITS ABILITY TO

ATTRACT CONSUMERS. FURTHER, OUR COMPANYS RESULTS COULD BE IMPACTED IF ONE OF OUR LEADING BRANDS

SUFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ITS REPUTATION DUE TO REAL OR PERCEIVED QUALITY ISSUES.

A MATERIAL CHANGE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR

RETAIL TRADE CUSTOMERS. THIS INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRADE TERMS THAT ARE

ACCEPTABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS. OUR

BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT WITH A KEY CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR TRADE TERMS AND

PRINCIPLES. FURTHER, THERE IS A CONTINUING TREND TOWARDS RETAIL TRADE CONSOLIDATION AND THIS LEADS

TO MORE COMPLEX WORK ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES FOR BOTH US AND KEY RETAILERS. THIS CAN

BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WHEN MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE ADDRESSING LOCAL TRADE PRESSURES OR LOCAL LAW

AND REGULATION CHANGES. FURTHER, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF A KEY CUSTOMER WERE

TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RANGE OR INVENTORY LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCTS.
