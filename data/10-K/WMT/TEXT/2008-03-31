BHARTI ENTERPRISES, AN INDIAN COMPANY, TO ESTABLISH A JOINT VENTURE CALLED BHARTI WAL-MART PRIVATE LIMITED TO CONDUCT WHOLESALE CASH-AND-CARRY AND BACK-END SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS IN INDIA, IN COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT OF INDIA

GUIDELINES. THE FIRST WHOLESALE FACILITY IS TARGETED TO OPEN IN LATE FISCAL 2009. THE JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED TO ESTABLISH WHOLESALE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES TO SERVE RETAILERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS BY SELLING THEM MERCHANDISE AT WHOLESALE PRICES,

INCLUDING BHARTI RETAIL, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF BHARTI ENTERPRISES, THAT IS DEVELOPING A CHAIN OF RETAIL STORES IN INDIA. IN ADDITION, BHARTI RETAIL HAS ENTERED INTO A FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH AN INDIAN SUBSIDIARY OF WAL-MART UNDER WHICH IT

WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO ITS RETAIL BUSINESS.

MERCHANDISE.

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR

9

A MAJORITY OF SALES, NUMEROUS STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS.

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN

COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WE ACCEPT A VARIETY OF PAYMENT METHODS INCLUDING CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND PRIVATE-LABEL STORE CREDIT CARDS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS. OTHER CONSUMER

FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

ACROSS THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, WE ARE

LEVERAGING BEST PRACTICES, LESSONS FROM MULTIPLE STORE FORMATS AND GLOBAL PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY GLOBAL SUPPLIERS CONTINUE TO HELP US LEVERAGE OUR VOLUMES ACROSS COUNTRIES.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF

SALES OCCURS IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN THE SUPERMARKET, DISCOUNT,

DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY, SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN MEXICO, WITH LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

RESTAURANT CHAINS. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL UNITS, OUR ABILITY TO

EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENTS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION.

WE UTILIZE A TOTAL OF 143 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES LOCATED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TWO

EXPORT CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, WE PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC PRODUCT TO THE OPERATING UNITS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT. DURING FISCAL 2008, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. SUPPLIERS SHIP THE BALANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO OUR STORES IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OF THESE 143

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, WE OWNED 38 AND LEASED 68. THIRD PARTIES OWNED AND OPERATED THE REMAINING 37 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

EMPLOYEES.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2008, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 2.1 MILLION EMPLOYEES (ASSOCIATES) WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.42 MILLION ASSOCIATES IN THE UNITED

STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 635,000 ASSOCIATES INTERNATIONALLY. LIKE ALMOST ALL RETAILERS, THE COMPANY HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF PART-TIME, HOURLY OR NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES AND EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER IN EMPLOYEES EACH YEAR. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF COMPANY-PAID BENEFITS TO OUR ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING THE WAL-MART PROFIT SHARING AND 401(K) PLAN, STORE DISCOUNT CARDS OR SAMS CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, BONUSES BASED ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE, MATCHING A PORTION OF

PURCHASES IN THE ASSOCIATE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM, AND LIFE INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME ASSOCIATES. THE COMPANYS MEDICAL PLAN HAS NO LIFETIME MAXIMUM BENEFIT FOR MOST EXPENSES.

IN OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A VARIETY OF ASSOCIATE BENEFITS THAT VARY BASED ON CUSTOMARY LOCAL

RISK FACTORS

THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THAT WE FACE. OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT APPLY TO ALL

COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY, AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GLOBALLY OR IN ONE OR MORE OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN THE UNITED STATES,

HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, WEAKNESS IN THE HOUSING MARKET, INFLATION, HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, UNAVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT, HIGHER CONSUMER DEBT LEVELS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS,

OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE SELL THROUGH OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT AND SAMS CLUB SEGMENT, CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL TO ONE WITH A LOWER

AVERAGE GROSS MARGIN AND RESULT IN SLOWER INVENTORY TURNOVER AND GREATER MARKDOWNS ON INVENTORY. HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INFLATION, HIGHER COSTS OF LABOR, INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES FLUCTUATIONS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES CAN INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES, AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT AND SAMS CLUB SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS AFFECT NOT ONLY OUR OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE OPERATIONS OF SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE PURCHASE GOODS,

A FACTOR THAT CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE COST TO US OF THE GOODS WE SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS. HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER LAWS, CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ECONOMIES OF THE

OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR MERCHANDISE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN WHICH AVERAGE INCOMES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

GROSS MARGINS, COST OF SALES, INVENTORY TURNOVER AND MARKDOWNS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT.

WE MAY FACE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR EXPANSION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS OF DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW MARKETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND UPON OUR ABILITY

TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORES IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN ADDITIONAL SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND SAMS CLUBS AND TO CONVERT EXISTING DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS

DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAND USE AND OTHER REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS OF THE TYPE IN WHICH WE

OPERATE OUR VARIOUS FORMATS, AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION OPPOSED TO THE LOCATION OF SPECIFIC STORES AT SPECIFIC SITES AND THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN LOCAL LAWS RESTRICTING OUR OPERATIONS, MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES AND CLUBS, TO

CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS OR TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN CITIES AND STATES. INCREASED REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONVERT OUR DISCOUNT

STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OPEN NEW SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS OR SAMS CLUBS OR CONTINUE TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS NET SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME GROWTH, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND ARE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS OR ARE OTHERWISE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR PRESENCE IN A MARKET, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

11

IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES EXPANSION BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

THAT ADD NEW STORES AND MARKETS TO OUR EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OPENING NEW UNITS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS. IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS, NEW UNITS MAY BE OPENED IN THE FORMATS

ALREADY EXISTING IN THOSE COUNTRIES OR MAY BE OPENED IN NEWLY INTRODUCED FORMATS, SUCH AS SUPERCENTERS OR SAMS CLUBS, NOT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED IN THOSE MARKETS. AS IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES OR TO EXPAND OR RELOCATE

EXISTING STORES IN A MARKET SERVED BY OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAWS CAN AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ATTRACTIVE PRE-EXISTING BUILDINGS IN WHICH TO LOCATE UNITS OR SITES ON WHICH TO BUILD NEW UNITS OR TO EXPAND EXISTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADD NEW UNITS

OR TO EXPAND PRODUCT SELECTIONS IN EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. MOREOVER, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN SOME MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND OR INTO WHICH WE INTRODUCE NEW RETAIL CONCEPTS MAY RESULT IN THE CONSUMERS IN THOSE MARKETS NOT BEING AS

RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS AS WE ANTICIPATE THOSE CONSUMERS WILL BE AND MAY MAKE AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO SUCH ISSUES MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION PLANS FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES AND

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION OF ANY SUCH CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED. ALTHOUGH WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR ALLIANCES WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS OR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN A REASONABLE TIME. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR ACQUISITION OR ALLIANCE OR TO INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES AND OTHER LABOR ISSUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS,

INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO FILL POSITIONS THAT BECOME VACANT AT OUR EXISTING STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHILE CONTROLLING OUR ASSOCIATE WAGE AND RELATED LABOR COSTS, IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PERSONS IN THE WORK FORCE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS WITHIN THOSE MARKETS, PREVAILING WAGE RATES, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH AND OTHER

INSURANCE COSTS AND CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE, TO ATTRACT OR TO RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR IF OUR COSTS OF LABOR OR RELATED COSTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM OTHER RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE RETAIL BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETES FOR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, STORE SITES, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND IN OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS WITH MANY OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL RETAILERS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT COMPETES WITH RETAILERS

OPERATING DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES AND HYPERMARTS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER WHOLESALE CLUB

OPERATORS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNT RETAILERS, RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROCERS AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. INTERNATIONALLY, WE COMPETE WITH RETAILERS WHO

OPERATE DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. SUCH RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS COMPETE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS,

INCLUDING MERCHANDISE SELECTION AND AVAILABILITY, SERVICES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, LOCATION, STORE HOURS, IN-STORE AMENITIES AND PRICE. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EDLP, ROLLBACKS, STORE

WITHIN A STORE AND STORE OF THE COMMUNITY, HAVE ALLOWED US TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR COMPETITORS IN MOST INSTANCES. WHERE NECESSARY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH COMPETITORS WHO PRICE MERCHANDISE AT POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRICES WE SET UNDER

OUR EDLP PHILOSOPHY, WE WILL LOWER OUR PRICES ON GOODS FOR SALE. OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS ABOVE

FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR COMPETITIVE SITUATION IN OUR VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS

HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SOME CONSOLIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION AND SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE RETAIL MARKETPLACE. SUCH CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN

COMPETITORS WITH GREATLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, IMPROVED ACCESS TO MERCHANDISE, GREATER MARKET PENETRATION THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITIONS. SUCH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COULD RESULT IN THE

PROVISION OF A WIDER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

12

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOURCED AND THE SAFETY OF THOSE

PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS. GLOBAL SOURCING OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AND OTHERWISE BE CERTIFIED

AS MEETING OUR REQUIRED SUPPLIER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO MEET OUR STANDARDS, AND TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLIERS LOCATED

AND GOODS SOURCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH FOREIGN SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO MEET OUR SUPPLIER STANDARDS, LABOR PROBLEMS

EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS, THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIERS, MERCHANDISE QUALITY ISSUES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT AVAILABILITY AND COST, TRANSPORT SECURITY, INFLATION, AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO THE SUPPLIERS AND THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND OTHER IMPOSITIONS ON IMPORTED GOODS, TRADE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION

OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS OR OF GOODS CONTAINING CERTAIN MATERIALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR ACCESS TO PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR CUSTOMERS COUNT ON US TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SAFE PRODUCTS. CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFETY OF FOOD AND

NON-FOOD PRODUCTS THAT WE SOURCE FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEN SELL COULD CAUSE SHOPPERS TO AVOID PURCHASING CERTAIN PRODUCTS FROM US, OR TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THEIR FOOD AND NON-FOOD NEEDS, EVEN IF THE BASIS FOR THE CONCERN

IS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. ANY LOST CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF OUR CUSTOMERS WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO REESTABLISH. AS SUCH, ANY ISSUE REGARDING THE SAFETY OF ANY FOOD AND NON-FOOD ITEMS WE SELL, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, ACCOUNTING,

REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA, PUERTO RICO, AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS WELL AS THROUGH JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS IN CHINA. DURING FISCAL 2008, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERATED 24.2% OF OUR NET SALES. AS A RESULT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE EXPECT THAT OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN FUTURE YEARS DESPITE THE RECENT DISPOSITIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS IN GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS IN THESE COUNTRIES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR

REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY

CONSTRAINTS, CURRENCY REGULATIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH

FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, THE ECONOMIES OF SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS HAVE IN THE PAST SUFFERED FROM HIGH RATES OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY

DEVALUATIONS, WHICH, IF THEY OCCURRED AGAIN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE FOREIGN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF OTHER

COUNTRIES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING MAJOR FACILITIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LESS STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES.

ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN

COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. THE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ALSO EXIST WHEN DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY BE EXAGGERATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS

SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

NATURAL DISASTERS AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND

GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CIVIL UNREST IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR IN WHICH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED OR TERRORIST ATTACKS DISRUPTING TRANSPORTATION AND UTILITY SYSTEMS, BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND DOMESTICALLY, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES, THE CLOSURE OF ONE OR MORE STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE WORK FORCE IN A MARKET, THE TEMPORARY OR

LONG-TERM DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS FROM SOME LOCAL AND OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS, THE DISRUPTION IN THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS FROM OVERSEAS, DELAY IN THE DELIVERY OF GOODS TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR STORES WITHIN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE ARE

OPERATING, THE REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN OUR STORES AND DISRUPTION IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR STORES. THESE FACTORS COULD OTHERWISE DISRUPT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY AND OTHERS RESULTING FROM THE HURRICANES IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES

IN PROPERTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND LIMITATIONS IN COVERAGE OFFERED BY THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKETS TO US AND OTHERS. THE INSURANCE COVERAGE OFFERED TO THE COMPANY FOR NAMED WINDSTORMS, SUCH AS HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

LIMITED AND CARRIED HIGHER PREMIUMS THAN THE COVERAGE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO US. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO BE PRIMARILY SELF-INSURED FOR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM NAMED WINDSTORMS.

13

NAMED WINDSTORM ACTIVITY WAS MINIMAL IN FISCAL 2008, AND THE COMPANY DID NOT INCUR ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES

THIS PAST HURRICANE SEASON.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER

LITIGATION. CERTAIN OF THESE LAWSUITS, IF DECIDED ADVERSELY TO US OR SETTLED BY US, MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY A DEFENDANT IN NUMEROUS CASES CONTAINING

CLASS-ACTION ALLEGATIONS IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE BROUGHT CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN

DUKES V. WAL-MART STORES, INC.

, A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL PAST AND

PRESENT FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN ALL OF OUR RETAIL STORES AND WHOLESALE CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CLASS AS CERTIFIED IN

DUKES

CURRENTLY INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION PRESENT AND FORMER FEMALE ASSOCIATES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE

ALLEGE THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN IN PROMOTIONS, PAY, TRAINING AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS AND SEEK, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, FRONT PAY, BACK PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS FEES.

ON JUNE 4, 2004, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT HEARING THIS CASE ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE HAVE APPEALED. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2007, A DIVIDED THREE-JUDGE PANEL

OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION ASKING THAT THE DECISION BE RECONSIDERED BY A LARGER PANEL OF THE COURT OF APPEALS. ON

NOVEMBER 11, 2007, THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL WITHDREW ITS OPINION OF FEBRUARY 6, 2007, AND ISSUED A REVISED OPINION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC WAS DENIED AS MOOT. ON JANUARY 8, 2008, THE COMPANY FILED

A NEW PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC. WE DISCUSS THESE CASES AND OTHER LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE PARTY IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN NOTE 8 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE

PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IS INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER-RELATED INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS

AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

AS DO MOST RETAILERS, WE RECEIVE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR

ONLINE OPERATIONS AT WWW.WALMART.COM AND WWW.SAMSCLUB.COM DEPEND UPON THE SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS, INCLUDING INFORMATION PERMITTING CASHLESS PAYMENTS. A COMPROMISE OF OUR SECURITY SYSTEMS THAT RESULTS IN

CUSTOMER PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING OBTAINED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, AND COULD RESULT IN

LITIGATION AGAINST US OR THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, A SECURITY BREACH COULD REQUIRE THAT WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RELATED TO OUR INFORMATION SECURITY SYSTEMS AND COULD RESULT IN A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS,

PARTICULARLY OUR ONLINE SALES OPERATIONS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, SUMMARIZE RESULTS AND MANAGE

OUR BUSINESS. DISRUPTIONS IN BOTH OUR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY (BACK-UP) SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS.

ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE INDEPENDENT, REDUNDANT AND PHYSICALLY SEPARATE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS WE HAVE EACH YEAR, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE MAINTAIN UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS CRITICAL COMPUTER

SYSTEMS. OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS, ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM POWER OUTAGES, COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, SECURITY BREACHES, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, TORNADOES AND

HURRICANES, AND USAGE ERRORS BY OUR EMPLOYEES. IF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS ARE DAMAGED OR CEASE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO FIX OR REPLACE THEM, AND WE MAY SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR

OPERATIONS IN THE INTERIM. ANY MATERIAL INTERRUPTION IN BOTH OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND BACK-UP SYSTEMS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE PURSUING COMPLEX INITIATIVES TO TRANSFORM OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS, WHICH WILL INCLUDE, FOR MANY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, ESTABLISHING COMMON PROCESSES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS. THE RISK OF SYSTEM DISRUPTION IS INCREASED WHEN SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM CHANGES ARE

UNDERTAKEN, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS WILL MITIGATE THIS RISK. IF WE FAIL TO INTEGRATE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THAT COST SAVINGS ANTICIPATED TO BE DERIVED FROM THESE INITIATIVES.

14

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

CONSISTENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO TIMELY

IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES AND SPENDING PATTERNS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

ITEM 103 OF SEC REGULATION S-K REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS. THE FOLLOWING MATTERS ARE DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.

THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR SOLANO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, HAS ALLEGED THAT

THE COMPANYS STORE IN VACAVILLE, CALIFORNIA, FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CALIFORNIA STATUTES REGULATING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HANDLING PRACTICES. SPECIFICALLY, THE COUNTY IS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF

A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGED OR RETURNED PRODUCT CONTAINING DRY GRANULAR FERTILIZER AND PESTICIDES ON OR ABOUT APRIL 3, 2002. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING TOWARD A RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER.

THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, HAS ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANYS STORE IN FOOTHILL RANCH, CALIFORNIA, FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CALIFORNIA

STATUTES REGULATING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HANDLING PRACTICES. SPECIFICALLY, THE COUNTY IS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGED PRODUCT CONTAINING DRY GRANULAR PESTICIDE ON OR ABOUT

JANUARY 24, 2005. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING TOWARD A RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER.

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) APPROACHED A GROCERY INDUSTRY GROUP TO RESOLVE ISSUES RELATING TO REFRIGERANT-HANDLING PRACTICES AND TO REDUCE THE USE OF OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS IN REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY THEN APPROACHED THE EPA INDEPENDENTLY TO

ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, AND PROPOSED A PLAN FOR REMOVING OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER.

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED FROM THE EPA A REQUEST PURSUANT TO SECTION 114(A) OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT SEEKING DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING

ALL NON-ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES INCLUDING PRODUCTS SUCH AS LOONY STRING WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED SINCE JANUARY 1, 2002. ON MARCH 8, 2007, THE EPA ISSUED A REVISED REQUEST FOR

INFORMATION IN WHICH IT LIMITED ITS REQUEST TO STRING PRODUCTS INCLUDING LOONY STRING, SILLY STRING AND FIESTA STRING, AND COVERING THE PERIOD FROM 2004 TO THE PRESENT. THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE EPA ON MAY 8, 2007, AND IS

CONTINUING TO GATHER THE REQUESTED INFORMATION. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE EPA REGARDING THIS MATTER.

IN JANUARY 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO

RICO, INC. BECAME AWARE THAT THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (USACE) WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF A PERMIT ISSUED BY THAT AGENCY IN 2003, FOR THE FILL OF 0.23 ACRES OF A CREEK AND ITS CONTIGUOUS WETLANDS DURING THE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE WAL-MART STORE IN CAGUAS, PUERTO RICO. ON JANUARY 19, 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO RICO RESPONDED TO THESE ISSUES IN WRITING. ON JANUARY 25, 2007, THE USACE ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE TO WAL-MART PUERTO RICO

REGARDING THIS MATTER. WAL-MART PUERTO RICO FILED A FORMAL RESPONSE AND IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING MITIGATION MEASURES AND WORKING WITH THE USACE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER.

ON NOVEMBER 8, 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS RECEIPT, TRANSPORTATION, HANDLING, IDENTIFICATION, RECYCLING, TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN MERCHANDISE THAT CONSTITUTES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE U.S. ATTORNEYS

OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS A TARGET OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA), THE CLEAN WATER ACT, AND THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION

STATUTE. THIS U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE CONTENDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE USE OF COMPANY TRUCKS TO TRANSPORT CERTAIN RETURNED MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANYS STORES TO ITS RETURN CENTERS IS PROHIBITED BY RCRA BECAUSE THOSE MATERIALS MAY

BE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT, TO COMPLY WITH RCRA, THE COMPANY MUST SHIP FROM THE STORE CERTAIN MATERIALS AS HAZARDOUS WASTE DIRECTLY TO A CERTIFIED DISPOSAL FACILITY USING A CERTIFIED HAZARDOUS WASTE

CARRIER. THE COMPANY CONTENDS THAT THE PRACTICE OF TRANSPORTING RETURNED MERCHANDISE TO ITS RETURN CENTERS FOR SUBSEQUENT DISPOSITION, INCLUDING DISPOSAL BY CERTIFIED FACILITIES, IS COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT

CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA HAS INITIATED ITS OWN INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS HANDLING OF

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENT REQUESTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL REQUESTING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE COMPANYS

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. FURTHER, THE COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTERROGATORIES REQUESTING INFORMATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGARDING THE

COMPANYS HANDLING OF MATERIALS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE. CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND THE STATE OF NEVADA HAVE ALSO INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO THESE MATTERS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE RESPECTIVE

AUTHORITIES. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON MARCH 28, 2008, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION FROM THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (DEPARTMENT) ALLEGING CERTAIN VIOLATIONS OF

MISSOURI HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE ALLEGATIONS WERE THE RESULT OF AN INSPECTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS FACILITY LOCATED IN MISSOURI. THE COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH THE THIRD PARTY TO RECYCLE AGRICULTURAL

OUR COMMON STOCK IS PRINCIPALLY TRADED IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AT MARCH 21, 2008, THE

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE REPURCHASED SHARES OF OUR COMMON

STOCK UNDER A $10.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN SEPTEMBER 2004. ON MAY 31, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPLACED THE $10.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH HAD $3.3 BILLION OF REMAINING

AUTHORIZATION FOR SHARE REPURCHASES, WITH A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 1, 2007. UNDER THE NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THERE IS NO EXPIRATION DATE OR OTHER RESTRICTION LIMITING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH WE CAN

MAKE OUR SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM, WHICH WILL EXPIRE ONLY WHEN AND IF WE HAVE REPURCHASED $15.0 BILLION OF OUR SHARES UNDER THE PROGRAM. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, REPURCHASED SHARES ARE CONSTRUCTIVELY RETIRED AND RETURNED TO UNISSUED

STATUS. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHEN TO EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CURRENT CASH NEEDS, OUR CAPACITY FOR LEVERAGE, OUR COST OF BORROWINGS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
