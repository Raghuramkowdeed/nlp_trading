inc. ("walmart," the "company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores, online, and through their mobile devices.   we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("edlp"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity.  edlp is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  our operations comprise three reportable business segments:  walmart u.s., walmart international and sam's club.  our fiscal year ends on january 31 for our united states ("u.s.") and canadian operations.  we consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis.  our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014"), january 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013") and january 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012").  during fiscal 2014, we generated total revenues of $476 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of $473 billion.walmart u.s. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in various formats in all 50 states in the u.s., washington d.c. and puerto rico, as well as its online retail operations, walmart.com.  walmart u.s. generated approximately 59% of our net sales in fiscal 2014 and, of our three segments, historically has had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"), and contributed the greatest amount to the company's net sales and operating income. walmart international consists of the company's operations in 26 countries outside of the u.s. and its operations include numerous formats of retail stores, wholesale clubs, including sam's clubs, restaurants, banks and various retail websites.  walmart international generated approximately 29% of our fiscal 2014 net sales.  the overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u.s. because of the margin impact from its merchandise mix.  walmart international has generally been our most rapidly growing segment, growing primarily through new stores and acquisitions and, in recent years, has been growing its net sales and operating income at a faster rate than our other segments.  however, for fiscal 2014, walmart international sales growth slowed due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, as well as no significant acquisitions, and operating income declined as a result of certain operating expenses.sam's club consists of warehouse membership clubs and operates in 48 states in the u.s. and in puerto rico, as well as its online operations, samsclub.com.  sam's club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2014 net sales.  sam's club operates as a warehouse membership club with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.  we maintain our principal offices at 702 s.w. 8th street, bentonville, arkansas 72716, usa.the development of our companyalthough walmart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m. walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport, arkansas.  in 1946, his brother, james l. walton, opened a similar store in versailles, missouri.  until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  in that year, the first wal-mart discount city, which was a discount store, opened in rogers, arkansas.  in 1984, we opened our first three sam's clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  in 1999, we opened our first neighborhood market.in 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico.  since then, our international presence has continued to expand and at january31, 2014, our walmart international segment conducted business in 26 countries. 5information about our segmentsthe company is engaged in the operation of:  retail stores and membership clubs located throughout the u.s.;

of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the u.s. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the walmart international segment operates.  in addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.operations. the hours of operation for operating units in the walmart international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  we accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers and credit cards issued by our subsidiaries in canada, chile and mexico.  limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.  across the walmart international segment, we are leveraging our best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. seasonal aspects of operations. the walmart international segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  the seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.competition. the walmart international segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate.  we also operate some restaurants and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations.  we compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units.  our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which walmart international operates.  we believe edlp is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to edlp.  additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.    distribution. we utilize a total of 151 distribution facilities located in argentina, brazil, canada, central america, chile, china, japan, mexico, south africa and the united kingdom.  through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the walmart international segment.  during fiscal 2014, approximately 80% of the walmart international segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.  suppliers ship the balance of the walmart international segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate.  of these 151 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 42, we owned and third parties operated 11, and we leased and operated 62.  third parties leased and operated the remaining 36 distribution facilities. 10sam's club segmentthe sam's club segment had net sales of $57.2 billion, $56.4 billion and $53.8 billion for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  during the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total company net sales.general. sam's clubs are membership only operations.  members include both business owners and individual consumers.  individual consumers are referred to as savings members (formerly advantage members).  the annual membership fee for an individual savings member is $45 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost.  the annual membership fee for business members is $45 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost.  in addition, business members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $45 each.  sam's club plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both business and savings members.  the annual fee for a business or savings plus member (formerly advantage plus members) is $100.  in addition, business plus members can add up to 16 business associates to their business membership for $45 each.  taxes, if applicable, are added to all membership fees.as a membership club warehouse, sam's club facility sizes generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.  sam's club also provides its members with a

starting at 7:00 a.m.  a variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including cash, check, debit cards, certain types of credit cards and private label and co-branded discover credit cards, issued by a third-party provider.  in addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our members' health benefit plans.seasonal aspects of operations. the sam's club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january31.competition. sam's club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers, gasoline stations and catalog businesses.  sam's club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites.  at sam's club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our savings and business members.  our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry.    distribution. during fiscal 2014, approximately 64% of the sam's club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the sam's club segment's dedicated distribution facilities or from some of the walmart u.s. segment's distribution facilities.  suppliers shipped the balance of the sam's club segment's purchases directly to sam's club locations.  as of january31, 2014, our sam's club segment operations were supported by 23 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental united states.  of these 23 distribution facilities, we owned and operated eight.  third parties owned and operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities.  additionally, some of the walmart u.s. distribution facilities also service our sam's club segment for certain items.the principal focus of our sam's club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.sam's club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  we contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. 12other segment

risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  these risks are not the only risks that we face.  our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the u.s. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.general or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.general economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.  higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory.  higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the u.s.  these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results.higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the u.s. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results.  the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, e-commerce retail or a combination of both retail offerings, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand.  the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our e-commerce businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings.  a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience and convenience. these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for  purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings.  failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, e-commerce offerings or through a combination of these retail offerings, could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. 16we may face impediments to our expansion in the u.s., including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance.our expansion strategy in the u.s. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the u.s. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations.  our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets, other store formats, and sam's clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states.  increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters.  if we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets, other small formats or sam's clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected.  in addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected.impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance.our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations.  in the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or sam's clubs, not previously operated in those markets.  as in the u.s., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units.  in addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.  moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve.  if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified.  although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time.  our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance.our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance.our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates.  our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations.  if we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 17we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, e-commerce retail or through a combination of both areas), which could adversely affect our financial performance.the retail business is highly competitive.  each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers.  our walmart u.s. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses.  our sam's club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.  internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses.  such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price.  where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale.  our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance.  see "item 1. business" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments.although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace.  such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions.  such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance.the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance.  all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct.  our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the u.s.  political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.  in addition, the u.s.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.  these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.our customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.  any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish.  as such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. 18our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance.we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in argentina, brazil, canada, china, india, japan and the united kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in africa, central america, chile, china and mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china.  during fiscal 2014, our walmart international operations generated approximately 29% of our consolidated net sales.  as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the u.s., we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years.  our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  these factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance.moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the u.s. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the u.s.  additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the u.s.  the various risks inherent in doing business in the u.s. generally also exist when doing business outside of the u.s., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.in foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by u.s. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act.  we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.  nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u.s. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance. 19natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance.the occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.  these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan, superstorm sandy in the u.s. in 2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the u.s. in 2013 and 2014, and could adversely affect our financial performance.in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses.  although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages.  significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation.  certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws.  in addition, we are a defendant in dukes v. wal-mart stores, inc., which was commenced as a class-action lawsuit in june 2001 in the united states district court for the northern district of california, asserting that the company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training, and job assignments, and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees.  on june21, 2004, the u.s. district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  as defined by the u.s. district court, the class included "[a]ll women employed at any wal-mart domestic retail store at any time since december26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to wal-mart's challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices."  the company appealed the order to the ninth circuit court of appeals and subsequently to the united states supreme court.  on june20, 2011, the supreme court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court.  on october27, 2011, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the company's california retail facilities, and the company filed a motion to dismiss on january13, 2012.  on september21, 2012, the court denied the motion.  the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on april15, 2013.  on august2, 2013, the court denied the motion.  on august16, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal that ruling to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit.  on november 18, 2013, the ninth circuit denied that petition.  on october28, 2011, the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the dukes case filed a similar complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of texas entitled odle v. wal-mart stores, inc., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in any walmart region that includes stores located in the state of texas.  on october15, 2012, the court in the odle case granted the company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations and the individual claims of the lead plaintiff, stephanie odle.  on march 19, 2013, the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal.  on october2, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee entitled phipps v. wal-mart stores, inc., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in "region 43, centered in middle and western tennessee."  on february20, 2013, the court in the phipps case granted the company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations.  on september11, 2013, the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit granted the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal that ruling.  on october4, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of florida entitled love v. wal-mart stores, inc., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in certain designated stores and clubs in regions centered in the state of florida.  on september23, 2013, the court in  20the love case granted the company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations.  finally, on february20, 2013, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin, entitled ladik v. wal-mart stores, inc., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in "region 14, which includes wal-mart retail stores located in parts of wisconsin, illinois, indiana and michigan."  on may24, 2013, the court in the ladik case granted the company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations.  on june13, 2013, the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal.  we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption "item 3. legal proceedings" and in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, which are part of our annual report to shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k.  we could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going fcpa matter. the audit committee of our board of directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including wal-mart de mxico, s.a.b. de c.v., or walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct.  we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs.  since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa.  inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, brazil, china and india.  in november 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the u.s. department of justice (the "doj") and the sec, and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa.  a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.  furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmex's current and former officers.we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters.  one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties.  the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review.  moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (incremental to the $282 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2014) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers.  these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business.  we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences.  our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues.  while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.  although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. 21if the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites, including walmart.com and samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.  increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping.  we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.  as a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer a "site-to-store" program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sam's club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly online merchandising platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates, vendors and others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results. as do most retailers, we receive and store certain personal information about our customers in our information systems, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors.  we also utilize use third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions.  in addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. we maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us. as a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures, we believe that past attempts by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful.  nevertheless, it is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold. any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.in addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.as a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard ("pci dss"), issued by the pci council. pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data.  despite our compliance with these standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. to the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations and others. in addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. 22we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business.although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.  our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates.  if our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim.  any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations.  in addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business.  the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk.  if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.item1b.unresolved staff commentsnone. 23item2.propertiesthe number of discount stores, supercenters, neighborhood markets, other small

principal office and lease office facilities throughout the u.s. for operations and field management.  the land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the company.  we use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  all store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

western dist. of wi, 2/20/13.ii. certain other proceedings: the company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in the new york times (the "times") on april 21, 2012.  one of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on may 7, 2012, in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the western district of arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the company.  the plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the company between december 8, 2011, and april 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock.  in addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in delaware and arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants.  the plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of fcpa compliance.  most, but not all, of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the western district of arkansas and the other in the delaware court of chancery.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.securities class action: city of

regulation s-k requires disclosure of certain environmental matters.  the following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.in january 2011, the environmental department of porto alegre municipality formally notified wms supermercados do brasil ltda ("walmart brazil"), a subsidiary of the company, of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in brazil.  walmart brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the district attorney's office for the state of rio grande do sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.  in july 2011, the environmental department of bento gonalves notified walmart brazil that it is investigating alleged soil contamination from oil leakage, in addition to the previous wastewater issue.  walmart brazil is cooperating with the agency and monitoring the affected area.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.  in january 2014, a division of the state department of sustainable development of santa catarina notified walmart brazil that a store did not have the proper license for a wastewater treatment system.  walmart brazil is working with the agency to resolve the issue.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.in february 2014, a division of the health department of the city of vitria notified walmart brazil that a wastewater leak had been observed in the parking lot of a store.  walmart brazil immediately took steps to address the situation and is cooperating with the agency to resolve the issue.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.in april 2013, a subsidiary of the company, corporacion de compaias agroindustriales, operating in costa rica, became aware that the municipality of curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall fifteen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank.  the subsidiary obtained permits from the municipality and the secretaria tcnica nacional ambiental at the time of construction, but the municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.  management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations.in 2013, wal-mart de mxico, s.a.b. de c.v. ("walmex"), a subsidiary of the company, resolved 21 enforcement actions with the mexico environmental protection agency in the state of michoacn, mexico, involving a variety of issues that occurred between 2008 and 2013.  the issues included, but were not limited to, record-keeping allegations, such as failure to maintain appropriate records for air conditioning equipment, and the alleged

financial disclosurenone.item9a.controls and proceduresevaluation of disclosure controls and procedureswe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities.  since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.in the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, automating manual processes and updating existing systems.  for example, we are currently implementing various new financial system applications in stages across the company.  to date, we have completed significant implementations in argentina, canada, central america, japan, mexico, the united kingdom and the united states.  as these financial system applications are implemented, they become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting.  we will continue to implement and update our financial system applications in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting.  additionally, we are currently establishing shared service functions and processes on a global scale.  the implementation of our global shared services is in the beginning stages, and we believe the related changes to processes and internal controls will allow us to be more efficient and further enhance our internal control over financial reporting. an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.  based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec's rules and forms.reports on internal control over financial reportingmanagement's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of ernst& young llp, the company's independent registered public accounting firm, on the company's
