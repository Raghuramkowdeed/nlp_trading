wal-mart stores, inc.  annual report on form 10-k  for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2006  part i  item1. business
general  wal-mart stores, inc.
(wal-mart or the company) operates retail stores in various formats around the world. wal-mart is committed to growing by improving the standard of living for our customers throughout the world. we earn the trust of our
customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices (edlp) while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. edlp is our pricing
philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional activity. our fiscal year ends on january31. during the fiscal year ended
january31, 2006, we had net sales of $312.4 billion.  our wal-mart stores segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting
for 67.2% of our fiscal 2006 sales. this segment consists of three different traditional retail formats, all of which operate in the united states, and wal-marts online retail format, walmart.com. our traditional wal-mart stores retail formats
include:
supercenters, which average approximately 187,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a full-line supermarket;
discount stores, which average approximately 102,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited variety of food products; and
neighborhood markets, which average approximately 42,000 square feet in size and offer a full-line supermarket and a limited assortment of general merchandise.
our sams club segment consists of membership warehouse clubs, which operate in the united states, and the
segments online retail format, samsclub.com. sams club accounted for 12.7% of our fiscal 2006 sales. our focus for sams club is to provide exceptional value on brand-name merchandise at members only prices for both
business and personal use. our sams clubs average approximately 129,000 square feet in size.  at january31, 2006, our
international segment consisted of retail operations in nine countries and puerto rico. this segment generated 20.1% of our fiscal 2006 sales. the international segment includes several different formats of retail stores and restaurants, including
discount stores, supercenters and sams clubs that operate outside the united states. additionally, at january31, 2006, we owned an unconsolidated minority interest of approximately 33.3% of central american retail holding company
(carhco), a retailer that operates more than 360 supermarkets and other stores in costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras and nicaragua. in february 2006, we acquired an additional 17.7% interest in carhco, to give us majority
ownership of carhco.  we maintain our principal offices at 702 s.w. 8th street, bentonville, arkansas 72716.  the development of our company  although wal-mart was
incorporated in delaware in october 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m. walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport, arkansas. in 1946, his brother, james l. walton, opened a similar store in
versailles, missouri. until 1962, our founders business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. in that year, the first wal-mart discount city, which was a discount store, was opened. in fiscal 1984, we opened our first three
sams clubs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter. in fiscal 1999, we opened our first neighborhood market.  in fiscal
1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with cifra s.a. de c.v. (cifra). in fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in cifra, and
in february 2000, cifra officially changed its name to wal-mart de mexico, s.a. de c.v. since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand, and at january31, 2006, we had international operations in argentina, brazil,
canada, germany, japan, mexico, puerto rico, south korea and the united kingdom. we also operate through joint ventures in china, and at january31, 2006, owned a minority interest in carhco.
at january31, 2006, we operated 1,209 discount stores, 1,980 supercenters, 567 sams clubs and
100 neighborhood markets in the united states. internationally, at january31, 2006, the company operated units in argentina (11), brazil (295), canada (278), germany (88), japan (398), mexico (774), puerto rico (54), south korea (16)and
the united kingdom (315). we also operated 56 stores through joint ventures in china at january31, 2006.  our growth, measured both
by our net sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases. for fiscal 2006 and prior years, we considered comparative store sales to be
sales at stores that were open as of february1st of the prior fiscal year and which had not been expanded or relocated since that date. comparative store sales are also referred to as same-store sales by others within the retail
industry. the method of calculating comparative store sales varies across the retail industry. as a result, our calculation of comparative store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. beginning
in fiscal 2007, we changed our method of calculating comparative store sales. these changes are described in our current report on form 8-k that we furnished to the sec on february2, 2006.  the following tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage for discount stores, supercenters, neighborhood
markets and sams clubs in the united states, and international units in each of our fiscal years from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006.  wal-mart stores segment store count  fiscal years ended january 31, 2002 through 2006  store count (1)

operations. hours of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing number
of discount stores and neighborhood markets are 24 hours each day. hours of operation for the remaining discount stores and neighborhood markets vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., seven days a week. the retail stores in our
wal-mart stores segment generally maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses; however, we accept a variety of payment methods. in addition, our pharmacy departments accept payments for prescription drugs through our customers health benefit plans.  seasonal aspects of operations. the wal-mart stores operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, its
highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.  competition. our discount stores compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national chains. our supercenters compete with other
supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. we also compete with other retailers for new store sites.  our ability to offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. we employ many programs
designed to meet the competitive pressures within our industry. these programs include the following:
every day low prices (edlp)  our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change
erratically under frequent promotional activity;
rollbacks  our commitment to pass continually internal and external cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;
store within a store  a program to provide accountability to assistant managers and department managers as to merchandise planning and overall department performance; and
store of the community  a program to ensure that the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in which that store is
located.
in addition to these programs, we believe our broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, our high
in-stock levels that provide confidence to our customers that we will have what they need, and our long operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience provide us with an additional competitive advantage.  distribution. during fiscal 2006, approximately 81% of the wal-mart stores segments purchases of merchandise were shipped from 114
distribution centers. the balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to stores from suppliers. wal-mart owns and operates 39 general merchandise distribution centers, 35 grocery distribution centers, seven apparel and shoes distribution
centers, 12 specialty distribution centers, three import distribution centers and one distribution center that supports walmart.com. additionally, third-party operators are used in 18 distribution centers of which two are grocery distribution
centers, five are specialty distribution centers and two are import distribution centers and eight support walmart.com. one of our three owned import facilities is operated by a third-party. the specialty distribution centers ship merchandise such
as jewelry, tires, optical, product returns, and pharmaceuticals. general merchandise is transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry
grocery merchandise.  the 114 distribution centers are located throughout the continental united states. fourteen distribution centers are
located in texas; ten in arkansas; nine in california; eight in georgia; six in indiana; five in florida; four in each of new york, ohio and pennsylvania; three in each of alabama, illinois, kentucky, missouri, north carolina, tennessee, utah and
virginia; two in each of arizona, louisiana, mississippi, oklahoma, south carolina, and wisconsin; and one each in colorado, delaware, iowa, kansas, maine, michigan, maryland, nebraska, nevada, new hampshire, new jersey, new mexico, oregon and
washington.  in addition to servicing the wal-mart stores segment, some of our wal-mart distribution centers also service our sams
club segment for perishable items, jewelry, tires and product returns.  sams club operating segment  the sams club segment had net sales of $39.8 billion, $37.1 billion and $34.5 billion for the fiscal years ended january31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. during the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total company sales or net income.  general. we operate sams clubs in 48 states. facility sizes for sams clubs generally range between 70,000 and 190,000 square feet, with the average sams club facility being approximately 129,000 square feet.
sams club provides to its members a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com.  merchandise. sams club offers bulk displays of brand name merchandise, including hardgoods, some softgoods, institutional-size grocery items, and selected private-label items under the members mark,
bakers& chefs and sams club brands. generally, each sams club also carries software, electronics, jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books. most clubs have fresh departments, which
include bakery, meat, produce, floral and sams cafe. additionally, a significant number of our clubs offer photo processing, pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gasoline stations.  sales in the sams club segment, which are subject to seasonal variance, by product category were as follows during the fiscal year ended:

certain fiscal 2005 amounts in the preceding table have been reclassed to conform to current
period presentation.  operations. operating hours for sams clubs are monday through friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30

advantage member is $40 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. sams club plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services. the annual membership fee for
a plus member is $100.  seasonal aspects of operations. the sams club operating segments business is seasonal to
a certain extent. generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.  competition. sams clubs compete with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and
general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. we compete with other retailers for desirable new club sites. our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise to meet the needs of small business members largely determines our competitive
position in the warehouse club industry.  distribution. during fiscal 2006, approximately 66% of the sams club non-fuel
purchases were shipped from the sams club segments dedicated distribution facilities and some of the wal-mart stores segments grocery distribution centers for perishable items. suppliers shipped the balance of the sams club
purchases directly to sams club locations. the principal focus of our sams clubs distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments
are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without extra storage. shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. a combination of seven company-owned and operated distribution
facilities, thirteen third-party owned and operated facilities, and two third-party owned and operated import distribution centers constitute the overall distribution structure for the sams club segment. to support the samsclub.com business,
sams club uses one third-party owned and operated distribution center in texas. two of the company-owned and operated facilities are located in texas with single facilities located in arizona, arkansas, colorado, indiana and minnesota. of the
third-party owned and operated facilities, two are in california and one is in each of florida, georgia, illinois, maryland, michigan, missouri, new hampshire, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania and washington. the third-party operated import
facilities are located in california and south carolina. sams club uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. we contract with common
carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.  international operating segment  our international segment is comprised of our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in argentina, brazil, canada, germany, puerto rico, south
korea, and the united kingdom, our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in japan and mexico and our operations through joint ventures in china. wal-marts portion of the results of our unconsolidated 33.3% minority interest in the
carhco were included in the companys other segment at january31, 2006. we acquired a controlling interest in carhco in february 2006, and after that date carhco will be consolidated into our international segment. carhco has retail
operations in costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras and nicaragua.  the international segments net sales for the fiscal years
ended january31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, were $62.7 billion, $56.3 billion and $47.6 billion, respectively. during the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total company sales or net income.  general.   at january31,
2006, our international operating formats varied by country and included:
discount stores in canada and puerto rico;
supercenters in argentina, brazil, china, germany, japan, mexico, puerto rico, south korea and the united kingdom;
sams clubs in brazil, canada, china, mexico, and puerto rico; and
neighborhood markets in china.
some of the more significant other formats that we operated at january31, 2006, included:
todo dia (combination discount and grocery stores), balaio (discount food and general merchandise stores), bompreo (supermarkets), hipermercado big (hypermarkets),
mercadorama (supermarkets), nacional (supermarkets) and maxxi atacado (wholesale units) in brazil;
seiyu stores (supermarkets, discount and department stores), livin stores (department stores) and sunny (supermarkets) in japan;
superama (supermarkets), bodega (combination discount and grocery stores), suburbia (department stores) and vips (restaurants) in mexico;
asda stores (combination grocery and apparel stores), george stores (apparel stores) and asda living stores (general merchandise stores) in the united kingdom; and,
amigo supermarkets in puerto rico.  merchandise. the merchandising strategy for the international operating segment is similar to that of our operations in the united states in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand name
merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates. in addition, steps have been taken to
develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.  operations.
the hours of operation for operating units in the international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. while sales are primarily on a
cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.  seasonal aspects of operations. the international operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. the seasonality of the business
varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.  competition. the international operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market
in each of the countries in which we operate and, in mexico, with local, national and international restaurant chains. our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the international operating
segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. in our international units, our ability to operate effectively the food departments has a major impact on the segments competitive position in the markets where we operate.
distribution. we utilize a total of 85 distribution facilities that are located in argentina, brazil, canada, china,
germany, japan, mexico, puerto rico and the united kingdom. through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating units of the international segment. during fiscal 2006, approximately 79% of the
international operating segments purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. suppliers ship the balance of the international operating segments purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. a
combination of company-owned and operated distribution facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for the international operating segment. the international operating segment operates export consolidation
facilities in california, florida, pennsylvania and texas in support of product flow to our mexican, canadian, asian, and latin american markets.  employees  as of january31, 2006, the company employed approximately 1.8million employees
(associates) worldwide, with approximately 1.3million associates in the united states and approximately 500,000 associates in foreign countries. in the united states, the company offers a broad range of company-paid benefits to our
associates, including a profit sharing and 401(k) plan, store discount cards, bonuses based on company performance, discounted stock purchase program and life insurance. the company also offers health care benefits to eligible full-time and
part-time associates. after the first year, the companys medical plan has no lifetime maximum for most expenses.  in our operations
outside the united states, the company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.  our website and availability of sec reports and other information  our corporate website is located at

investor relations page of our website under the corporate governance section. any such description will be located on our website for a period of twelve months following the amendment or waiver.  item1a. risk factors  the risks
described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. these risks are not the only risks that we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.  general economic factors, both domestically
and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.  general economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the
markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. in the united states, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other
changes in tax laws, and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our wal-mart stores segment and sams club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower
average gross margin and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign
exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses, and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our wal-mart stores segment and sams club segment. high levels of unemployment, inflation, changes in tax and other laws, currency devaluations and other adverse
developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise
adversely affect our operations and operating results in those countries.  we may face impediments to our expansion in the united
states, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  the
growth in the net sales and operating net income of our wal-mart stores segment and our sams club segment depends to a substantial degree on our expansion programs. our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts
successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets and
sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. local land use and other
regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites, may affect our ability to open new stores and
clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units. increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into
supercenters. if we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance could be adversely affected. in addition, if
consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts, our financial performance could be adversely affected.  impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance.  our
business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we
have existing operations. in the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or sams clubs, not
previously operated in those markets. as in the united states, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by
our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing
buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. in addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing
units in certain markets. moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate
those consumers will be. if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.  we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in consummating the acquisition of any such candidate identified. although we believe we will be
ultimately able to integrate successfully any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in
a reasonable time. our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment
and our future financial performance.  failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely
affect our financial performance.  our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our
ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. our ability to meet our labor needs generally, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and
distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are
located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. if we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if
our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be affected adversely.  we face strong
competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  the retail
business is highly competitive. each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the
united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. our wal-mart stores segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, as
well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as
well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs,
internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and
price. our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs, including edlp, rollbacks, store within a store and store of the community, have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances.
where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods sold. our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and
changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. see item 1. business. above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments.  although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which
could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration
than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which
could adversely affect our financial performance.
risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our
financial performance.  the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. global
sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier
standards of conduct. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the
united states. political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers,
the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our
control. in addition, the united states foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing
certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.  our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic
conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  we
currently conduct operations in argentina, brazil, canada, costa rico, el salvador, germany, guatemala, honduras, japan, mexico, nicaragua, puerto rico, south korea and the united kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in china. during
fiscal 2006, our international operations generated 20.1% of our net sales. as a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries, we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in
future years. our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. these factors include political
conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. in addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations
may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past
suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal
policies both of the united states and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have
historically been less stable than the united states. additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states. the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states, and may be
exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.  natural disasters and geo-political events costs could adversely affect our financial performance.  the occurrence of
one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located and attacks disrupting transportation systems, could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance. such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force
in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or
stores within a country in which we are operating and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores. these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  we expect that the significant property damage experienced by the company and others during last years hurricanes will result in substantial
increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others. as a result the company will likely face higher property insurance premiums, an increase in retained risk, or a
combination of the two, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operation.  we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other
litigation. certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial condition and results of operations. we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action
allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. in addition, we are a defendant in dukes v. wal-mart stores, inc., a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female
employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states. the class as certified in dukes currently includes approximately 1.6million present and former female associates. the plaintiffs in this case allege that we
have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys fees. the u.s.
district court hearing this case has issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification. we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the
caption item 3. legal proceedings and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, which are part of our annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this form 10-k and is included as an exhibit to this
annual report on form 10-k.  item1b. unresolved staff comments  none.  item2. properties  the number and location of united states and international wal-mart discount stores, supercenters and sams clubs and other formats are incorporated
by reference to the table under the caption fiscal 2006 end-of-year store count included in our annual report to shareholders for the year ended january31, 2006, which information we have included as an exhibit to this annual
report on form 10-k.  united states. as of january31, 2006, in the united states, we owned 2,589 of the buildings in
which discount stores, neighborhood markets and supercenters operated and 437 of the buildings in which our sams clubs operated. land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the company. in the united states, we either
lease the remaining buildings in which our stores and clubs operate from a commercial property developer, lease them pursuant to sale/leaseback arrangements or lease them from a local governmental entity in connection with industrial revenue bond
financing arrangements. all store leases provide for fixed annual rentals and, in some cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.  we use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  for details on our distribution centers, see
the caption distribution provided for each of our segments under item1. business.  we own the office facilities in
bentonville, arkansas that serve as our home office. we lease an office facility in brisbane, california that serves as the home office for walmart.com  international. we operate our international segment stores and restaurants in a combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our international segment operates. as of
january31, 2006, we owned nine properties in argentina, 107 properties in brazil, 96 properties in canada, no properties in china, 19 properties in germany, 86 properties in japan, 16 properties in south korea, 395 properties in mexico, 10
properties in puerto rico and 202 properties in the united kingdom in which operating units are located, with the remaining units in each country being leased on terms that vary from property to property. we utilize both owned and leased properties
for office facilities in each country in which we are conducting business. our international operations are supported by 85 distribution facilities as of january31, 2006. of these 85 distribution facilities, we owned 38 and leased 29. third
parties owned and operated the remaining 18 distribution facilities.  item3. legal proceedings  i. supplemental information: we discuss certain legal proceedings pending against us in note 8 to our financial statements, which is

disclosed in accordance with that requirement:  the district attorney for solano county, california, has alleged that the companys
store in vacaville, california, failed to comply with certain california statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. specifically, the county is alleging that the company improperly disposed of a limited amount of
damaged or returned product containing dry granular fertilizer and pesticides on or about april3, 2002. the parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.  the district attorney for orange county, california, has alleged that the companys store in foothill ranch, california, failed to comply with
certain california statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling
practices. specifically, the county is alleging that the company improperly disposed of a limited amount of damaged product containing dry granular pesticide
on or about january24, 2005. the parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.  the epa has alleged that the
company and one of its construction contractors have violated the epas stormwater regulations at a site in caguas, puerto rico. the administrative complaint filed by the agency proposes an administrative penalty in the amount of $157,500. the
parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.  on november8, 2005, the company received a grand jury subpoena
from the united states attorneys office for the central district of california, seeking documents and information relating to the companys receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of
certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. the company has been informed by the u.s. attorneys office for the central district of california that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential
violations of the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), the clean water act, and the hazardous materials transportation statute. this u.s. attorneys office contends, among other things, that the use of company trucks to
transport certain returned merchandise from the companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. the government alleges that, to comply with rcra, the company must ship from
the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. the company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for
subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations.  additionally, the
u.s. attorneys office in the northern district of california has initiated its own investigation regarding the companys handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the company has received administrative document requests
from the california department of toxic substances control requesting documents and information with respect to two of the companys distribution facilities. further, the company also received a subpoena from the los angeles county district
attorneys office for documents and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, regarding the companys handling of materials and hazardous waste. california state and local government authorities and the
state of nevada have also initiated investigations into these matters. the company is cooperating fully with the respective authorities.  the company cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise from this matter.  item4. submission of matters to a

changes to our systems and processes to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and
automating manual processes.  an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was
performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. this evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. based upon that
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it
files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms.  managements report on internal control over financial reporting  managements report on
