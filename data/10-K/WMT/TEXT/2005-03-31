WAL-MART STORES, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

WAL-MART STORES, INC. (WAL-MART OR THE COMPANY) OPERATES RETAIL STORES IN VARIOUS FORMATS AROUND THE WORLD. WAL-MART IS COMMITTED

TO GROWING BY IMPROVING THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE EARN THE TRUST OF OUR CUSTOMERS EVERY DAY BY PROVIDING A BROAD ASSORTMENT OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES AT EVERYDAY LOW PRICES (EDLP) WHILE

FOSTERING A CULTURE THAT REWARDS AND EMBRACES MUTUAL RESPECT, INTEGRITY AND DIVERSITY. EDLP IS OUR PRICING PHILOSOPHY UNDER WHICH WE PRICE ITEMS AT A LOW PRICE EVERY DAY SO THAT OUR CUSTOMERS TRUST THAT OUR PRICES WILL NOT CHANGE ERRATICALLY UNDER

FREQUENT PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY. OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON JANUARY 31. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005, WE HAD NET SALES OF $285.2 BILLION.

OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF OUR BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING FOR 67.3% OF OUR FISCAL 2005 SALES. THIS SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THREE

DIFFERENT RETAIL FORMATS, ALL OF WHICH OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING.



DISCOUNT STORES, WHICH AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 100,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE AND OFFER A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND A LIMITED VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS;



SUPERCENTERS, WHICH AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 187,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE AND OFFER A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND A FULL-LINE SUPERMARKET; AND



NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS, WHICH AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 43,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE AND OFFER A FULL-LINE SUPERMARKET AND A LIMITED ASSORTMENT OF GENERAL MERCHANDISE.

OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT CONSISTS OF

MEMBERSHIP WAREHOUSE CLUBS WHICH OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACCOUNTS FOR 13.0% OF OUR FISCAL 2005 SALES. OUR FOCUS FOR SAMS CLUB IS TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL VALUE ON BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT MEMBERS ONLY PRICES FOR BOTH

BUSINESS AND PERSONAL USE. OUR SAMS CLUBS AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 128,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF RETAIL OPERATIONS IN EIGHT COUNTRIES AND PUERTO RICO. THIS SEGMENT GENERATED 19.7% OF OUR FISCAL 2005 SALES. THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES SEVERAL DIFFERENT FORMATS OF RETAIL STORES AND RESTAURANTS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS AND SAMS CLUBS THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONALLY, WE OWN AN UNCONSOLIDATED MINORITY INTEREST

OF APPROXIMATELY 37% OF THE SEIYU, LTD. (SEIYU), A RETAILER IN JAPAN.

WE MAINTAIN OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES AT 702 S.W. 8TH STREET, BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS 72716.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COMPANY

ALTHOUGH WAL-MART WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN OCTOBER 1969, THE BUSINESSES CONDUCTED BY OUR FOUNDERS BEGAN IN 1945 WHEN SAM M. WALTON OPENED A

FRANCHISE BEN FRANKLIN VARIETY STORE IN NEWPORT, ARKANSAS. IN 1946, HIS BROTHER, JAMES L. WALTON, OPENED A SIMILAR STORE IN VERSAILLES, MISSOURI. UNTIL 1962, OUR FOUNDERS BUSINESS WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE OPERATION OF VARIETY STORES. IN

THAT YEAR, THE FIRST WAL-MART DISCOUNT CITY, WHICH WAS A DISCOUNT STORE, WAS OPENED. IN FISCAL 1984, WE OPENED OUR FIRST THREE SAMS CLUBS, AND IN FISCAL 1988, WE OPENED OUR FIRST SUPERCENTER. IN FISCAL 1999, WE OPENED OUR FIRST NEIGHBORHOOD

MARKET.

IN FISCAL 1992, WE BEGAN OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL

INITIATIVE WHEN WE ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE IN MEXICO, IN WHICH WE HAD A 50% INTEREST ALONG WITH CIFRA S.A. DE C.V. (CIFRA). IN FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED THE CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CIFRA, AND IN FEBRUARY 2000, CIFRA OFFICIALLY

CHANGED ITS NAME TO WAL-MART DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. SINCE FISCAL 1992, OUR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND AT JANUARY 31, 2005, WE HAD INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, GERMANY, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO, SOUTH

KOREA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ALSO OPERATE THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA AND OWN A MINORITY INTEREST IN SEIYU.

AT JANUARY 31, 2005, WE OPERATED IN THE UNITED STATES 1,353 DISCOUNT STORES, 1,713 SUPERCENTERS, 551 SAMS CLUBS AND 85 NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS.

INTERNATIONALLY, AT JANUARY 31, 2005, THE COMPANY OPERATED UNITS IN ARGENTINA (11), BRAZIL (149), CANADA (262), GERMANY (91), SOUTH KOREA (16), MEXICO (679), PUERTO RICO (54) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (282). WE ALSO OPERATED 43 STORES THROUGH JOINT

VENTURES IN CHINA AT JANUARY 31, 2005. ADDITIONALLY, SEIYU THEN OPERATED 403 STORES THROUGHOUT JAPAN.

3

OUR GROWTH, MEASURED BOTH BY OUR NET SALES AND NET INCOME, OCCURS IN LARGE MEASURE AS A RESULT OF OUR

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION PROGRAMS ALONG WITH COMPARATIVE STORE SALES INCREASES. WE CONSIDER COMPARATIVE STORE SALES TO BE SALES AT STORES THAT WERE OPEN AS OF FEBRUARY 1ST OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN EXPANDED OR

RELOCATED SINCE THAT DATE. COMPARATIVE STORE SALES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS SAME-STORE SALES BY OTHERS WITHIN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING COMPARATIVE STORE SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR

CALCULATION OF COMPARATIVE STORE SALES IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE SUMMARY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ADDITIONS OF UNITS AND SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS, NEIGHBORHOOD

MARKETS AND SAMS CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND INTERNATIONAL UNITS IN EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS FROM 2001 THROUGH 2005.

MUCH OF OUR GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY IN RECENT YEARS HAS RESULTED FROM OUR

ACQUISITION OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. DURING MAY 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ITS INITIAL 6.1% STAKE IN SEIYU, A JAPANESE RETAIL CHAIN, FOR APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 192.8 MILLION ADDITIONAL

SHARES IN SEIYU FOR APPROXIMATELY $432 MILLION THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF THE FIRST IN THE SERIES OF WARRANTS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED TO US. FOLLOWING THIS EXERCISE AND OUR PURCHASE OF 29.3 MILLION ADDITIONAL SEIYU SHARES IN OTHER SEIYU SECURITIES

OFFERINGS, OUR OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE IN SEIYU INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY 37%. THROUGH A SERIES OF WARRANTS EXERCISABLE THROUGH 2007, WE CAN CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY ¥235 BILLION, OR $2.3 BILLION AT A JANUARY 31, 2005 EXCHANGE RATE OF 103.68 YEN

PER DOLLAR, FOR ADDITIONAL SHARES OF SEIYU STOCK. IF THE NEXT TRANCHE OF WARRANTS IS EXERCISED IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF SEIYU. IF ALL THE WARRANTS ARE EXERCISED, WE WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE STOCK OF SEIYU BY

OPERATIONS

THE WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, ITS HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, WHICH INCLUDES THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS

DURING OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION

OUR

DISCOUNT STORES COMPETE WITH OTHER DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES AND SUPERMARKETS, MANY OF WHICH ARE NATIONAL CHAINS. OUR SUPERCENTERS COMPETE WITH OTHER SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERMARKETS AND SPECIALTY

STORES, MANY OF WHICH ARE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL CHAINS. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAILERS FOR NEW STORE SITES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2005

,

THE WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT RANKED FIRST, BASED ON NET SALES, AMONG ALL RETAIL DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS

AND AMONG ALL DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS.

OUR ABILITY TO

OFFER VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS LARGELY DETERMINES OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WITHIN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. WE EMPLOY MANY PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



EVERYDAY LOW PRICE (EDLP)  OUR PRICING PHILOSOPHY UNDER WHICH WE PRICE ITEMS AT A LOW PRICE EVERY DAY SO THAT OUR CUSTOMERS TRUST THAT OUR PRICES WILL NOT CHANGE

ERRATICALLY UNDER FREQUENT PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY;



ROLLBACKS  OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUALLY PASS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COST SAVINGS ON TO THE CUSTOMER;



STORE WITHIN A STORE  A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY TO ASSISTANT MANAGERS AND DEPARTMENT MANAGERS AS TO MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND OVERALL DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE; AND



STORE OF THE COMMUNITY  A PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT FITS THE DEMOGRAPHIC NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

IN ADDITION TO THESE PROGRAMS, WE BELIEVE OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT PROVIDES

ONE-STOP SHOPPING, OUR HIGH IN-STOCK LEVELS THAT PROVIDE CONFIDENCE TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE WILL HAVE WHAT THEY NEED, AND OUR LONG OPERATING HOURS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AT THEIR CONVENIENCE PROVIDE US WITH AN ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS

THE SAMS CLUB OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, ITS HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, WHICH INCLUDES THE HOLIDAY

SEASON, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS DURING OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.

COMPETITION

SAMS CLUBS COMPETE WITH OTHER WAREHOUSE CLUBS, AS WELL AS WITH DISCOUNT RETAILERS, RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROCERS AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER RETAILERS FOR

DESIRABLE NEW CLUB SITES. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER LOW PRICES AND QUALITY MERCHANDISE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESS MEMBERS DETERMINES OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE WAREHOUSE CLUB INDUSTRY.

DISTRIBUTION

DURING FISCAL 2005, APPROXIMATELY 62% OF THE

SAMS CLUB PURCHASES WERE SHIPPED FROM THE SAMS CLUB SEGMENTS DEDICATED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND SOME OF OUR GROCERY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR PERISHABLE ITEMS. SUPPLIERS SHIPPED THE BALANCE OF THE SAMS CLUB PURCHASES

DIRECTLY TO SAMS CLUB LOCATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF OUR SAMS CLUBS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS IS ON CROSSDOCKING PRODUCT, WHILE STORED INVENTORY IS MINIMIZED. CROSSDOCKING IS A DISTRIBUTION PROCESS UNDER WHICH

11

SHIPMENTS ARE DIRECTLY TRANSFERRED FROM INBOUND TO OUTBOUND TRAILERS WITHOUT STORAGE IN BETWEEN. SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY

SPEND LESS THAN 24 HOURS IN A CROSSDOCK FACILITY, SOMETIMES LESS THAN AN HOUR. A COMBINATION OF SEVEN COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND TWELVE THIRD-PARTY OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES CONSTITUTE THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION

STRUCTURE FOR THE SAMS CLUB SEGMENT. TWO OF THE COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN TEXAS WITH SINGLE FACILITIES LOCATED IN ARIZONA, ARKANSAS, COLORADO, MINNESOTA AND INDIANA. THE THIRD-PARTY OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES ARE

IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ILLINOIS, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NORTH CAROLINA, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHINGTON. SAMS CLUB USES A COMBINATION OF OUR PRIVATE TRUCK FLEET AS WELL AS COMMON CARRIERS TO TRANSPORT OUR

NON-PERISHABLE MERCHANDISE FROM DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO OUR CLUBS. WE CONTRACT WITH COMMON CARRIERS TO TRANSPORT OUR PERISHABLE GROCERY MERCHANDISE FROM DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO OUR CLUBS.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN ARGENTINA, CANADA, GERMANY, PUERTO RICO, SOUTH KOREA, AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM, OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN BRAZIL AND MEXICO AND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA. WAL-MARTS PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED 37% MINORITY INTEREST IN JAPANESE RETAILER,

SEIYU, IS INCLUDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS NET SALES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, WERE $56.3 BILLION, $47.6 BILLION AND $40.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR, NO

SINGLE UNIT ACCOUNTED FOR AS MUCH AS 1% OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES OR NET INCOME.

GENERAL

OPERATING FORMATS VARY BY COUNTRY, AND INCLUDE DISCOUNT STORES IN CANADA AND PUERTO RICO; SUPERCENTERS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM; SAMS CLUBS IN BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, MEXICO, AND PUERTO RICO; SUPERAMAS (TRADITIONAL SUPERMARKET), BODEGAS (COMBINATION DISCOUNT AND GROCERY STORE), SUBURBIAS (SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE) AND VIPS (RESTAURANT) IN MEXICO; TODO DIAS

STORE) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; AND AMIGO SUPERMARKETS IN PUERTO RICO.

MERCHANDISE

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME

MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF SALES, SEVERAL STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN

COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WHILE SALES ARE PRIMARILY ON A CASH-AND-CARRY BASIS, CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS

BY THE CUSTOMER.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND

RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN THE SUPERMARKET, DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY, SPECIALTY AND WHOLESALE

SECTORS OF THE RETAIL MARKET IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN MEXICO, WITH LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT CHAINS. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL UNITS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENTS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE

MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION

THE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT OPERATES EXPORT CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA AND TEXAS IN SUPPORT OF PRODUCT FLOW TO ITS MEXICAN, CANADIAN, ASIAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS. WE OPERATE A TOTAL OF 58 DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, GERMANY, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, WE PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC PRODUCT TO THE OPERATING UNITS. DURING FISCAL 2005,

APPROXIMATELY 76% OF THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. SUPPLIERS SHIP THE BALANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO OUR STORES IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. A COMBINATION OF COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES MAKES UP THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT.

12

EMPLOYEES (ASSOCIATES)

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2005, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION ASSOCIATES WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION

ASSOCIATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 410,000 ASSOCIATES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF COMPANY PAID BENEFITS TO OUR ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING A PROFIT SHARING AND 401(K) PLAN, STORE DISCOUNT

CARDS, BONUSES BASED ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE, DISCOUNTED STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM AND LIFE INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME ASSOCIATES. AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, THE COMPANYS MEDICAL PLAN HAS

NO LIFETIME MAXIMUM FOR MOST EXPENSES.

IN OUR OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A VARIETY OF ASSOCIATE BENEFITS WHICH VARY BASED ON CUSTOMARY LOCAL PRACTICES AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.

RISK FACTORS

THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY

ONES THAT WE FACE. OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND

INTERNATIONALLY, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, HIGHER LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND ECONOMIC

FACTORS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE MERCHANDISE WE OFFER, CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD TO ONE WITH A LOWER AVERAGE GROSS MARGIN, RESULT IN INCREASED COST OF SALES, SLOWER INVENTORY TURNOVER AND GREATER MARKDOWNS ON INVENTORY

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR WAL-MART STORES AND SAMS CLUBS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER LAWS, CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS

IN THE ECONOMIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR MERCHANDISE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS, COST OF SALES, INVENTORY TURNOVER AND MARKDOWNS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

WE MAY FACE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR EXPANSION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS OF DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS.

THE GROWTH IN THE NET SALES AND OPERATING NET INCOME OF OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT AND OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT DEPENDS TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE ON OUR

EXPANSION PROGRAMS. OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW MARKETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND UPON OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORES IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE

OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND SAMS CLUBS AND TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL AND TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAND USE AND OTHER REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS OF THE TYPE IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR VARIOUS FORMATS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES AND CLUBS, TO

CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS OR TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND EXISTING UNITS. INCREASED REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONVERT OUR DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS. IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO OPEN NEW DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS OR SAMS CLUBS OR CONTINUE TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETS

INTO WHICH WE EXPAND ARE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES EXPANSION BY

SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES THAT ADD NEW STORES AND MARKETS TO OUR EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS BY OPENING OF NEW UNITS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING. AS IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR ABILITY TO

OPEN NEW STORES IN OUR CURRENT MARKETS DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAWS CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ATTRACTIVE

PRE-EXISTING BUILDINGS IN WHICH TO LOCATE UNITS OR SITES ON WHICH TO BUILD NEW UNITS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADD NEW UNITS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR

EXPANSION PLANS FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES OR BE SUCCESSFUL IN CONSUMMATING THE

ACQUISITION OF ANY SUCH CANDIDATE. IN ADDITION, WHILE WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ULTIMATELY ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR ALLIANCES WILL BE

SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS OR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN A REASONABLE TIME. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR ACQUISITION OR ALLIANCE OR TO INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INTO OUR

EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

13

FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES AND OTHER LABOR ISSUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS GENERALLY WHILE CONTROLLING OUR ASSOCIATE WAGE AND RELATED

LABOR COSTS IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PERSONS IN THE WORK FORCE, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, PREVAILING WAGE RATES, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS AND

CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE, TO ATTRACT OR TO RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR IF OUR COSTS OF LABOR OR RELATED COSTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM OTHER RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB

OPERATORS.

THE RETAIL BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETES FOR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, STORE SITES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS WITH MANY OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL RETAILERS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE FOREIGN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT COMPETES WITH RETAILERS OPERATING DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND

CATALOG BUSINESSES. OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS. INTERNATIONALLY, WE COMPETE WITH RETAILERS WHO OPERATE DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKET, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS,

WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. SUCH RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS COMPETE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING MERCHANDISE SELECTION, SERVICES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, LOCATION AND PRICE. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER

VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EDLP, ROLLBACKS, STORE WITHIN A STORE AND STORE OF THE COMMUNITY, HAVE ALLOWED US TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE AGAINST OUR COMPETITORS IN MOST INSTANCES. WHERE NECESSARY TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITH COMPETITORS WHO PRICE MERCHANDISE AT POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRICES WE SET UNDER OUR EDLP PHILOSOPHY, WE WILL LOWER OUR PRICES ON GOODS SOLD. OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL

MARKETS COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS. BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR COMPETITIVE SITUATION.

CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SOME CONSOLIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION AND SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER

THE DYNAMICS OF THE RETAIL MARKETPLACE. SUCH CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN COMPETITORS WITH GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES, BETTER ACCESS TO MERCHANDISE, GREATER MARKET PENETRATION AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITIONS. SUCH BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS COULD RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF A WIDER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VENDORS FROM WHOM OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOURCED

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE

PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL VENDORS. GLOBAL SOURCING OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL OF OUR VENDORS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS,

INCLUDING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AND OTHERWISE BE CERTIFIED AS MEETING OUR REQUIRED VENDOR STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED VENDORS WHO MEET OUR STANDARDS, AND ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO GOODS SOURCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL INSTABILITY, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO MEET OUR VENDOR STANDARDS, MERCHANDISE QUALITY ISSUES, TRADE

RESTRICTIONS, TARIFFS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT CAPACITY AND COSTS, INFLATION AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE AND OTHER ISSUES AFFECTING OUR VENDORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, GERMANY, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO, SOUTH KOREA AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM, AS WELL AS THROUGH JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS IN CHINA. WE ALSO OWN A MINORITY INTEREST IN SEIYU, A RETAILER IN JAPAN. DURING FISCAL 2005, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERATED 19.7% OF OUR NET SALES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS IN THESE

COUNTRIES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY

CONSTRAINTS, CURRENCY REGULATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE OR INTEND TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE

COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE FOREIGN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS,

REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING MAJOR FACILITIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LESS STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONAL RISKS

INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF

14

MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. THE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ALSO EXIST WHEN DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY BE EXAGGERATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS DUE TO

DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

WE ARE

OF HARTFORD ALLEGING VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE PERMITS OR FAILED TO MAINTAIN REQUIRED RECORDS RELATING TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT 12 STORES. IN DECEMBER

2003, THE STATE FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY ALSO HAD DISCHARGED WASTEWATER ASSOCIATED WITH VEHICLE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND PHOTO PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WITHOUT PROPER PERMITS. THE SUIT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE COMPANYS

COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PERMITS APPLICABLE TO THOSE ACTIVITIES.

16

THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND THE STATES OF TENNESSEE AND UTAH

HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS HAVE VIOLATED THE EPAS STORMWATER REGULATIONS AT SPECIFIED SITES AROUND THE COUNTRY. ON JULY 31, 2003, THE COMPANY SERVED THE EPA WITH A NOTICE OF DISPUTE AS REQUIRED BY A

NATIONAL CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE EPA IN AUGUST 2001. SERVING THE NOTICE OF DISPUTE INITIATED AN INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT DECREE. THE COMPANY HAS SETTLED THESE

ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING OR VIOLATIONS OF THE REGULATIONS BY AGREEING TO PAY A $3.1 MILLION CIVIL PENALTY AND ENTERING INTO A NEW CONSENT DECREE. THE PARTIES ARE AWAITING ENTRY BY THE COURT OF THE FINAL CONSENT DECREE.

IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A GRAND JURY

GOVERNMENTS ONGOING INVESTIGATION; TO PAY $11 MILLION TO SUPPORT FUTURE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES BY THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO STORE MANAGERS ON RELEVANT IMMIGRATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS; AND TO

PUT CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS ARE TAKING REASONABLE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH IMMIGRATION LAWS.

ON NOVEMBER 10, 2003, A CIVIL ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, CAPTIONED

ZAVALA, ET AL. V. WAL-MART CORPORATION, ET AL.
