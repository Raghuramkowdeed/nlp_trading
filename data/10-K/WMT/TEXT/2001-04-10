INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT COMPRISES THE COMPANY'S WHOLLY OWNED

OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, CANADA, GERMANY, KOREA, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM; OPERATIONS THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA; AND OF OPERATIONS THROUGH MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN BRAZIL AND MEXICO. THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT'S SALES FOR THE

THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999, WERE $32,100,000,000, $22,728,000,000 AND $12,247,000,000, RESPECTIVELY. SALES FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM OPERATION DURING FISCAL 2001 AND 2000 WERE $14,500,000,000 AND $7,200,000,000,

RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR, NO SINGLE LOCATION ACCOUNTED FOR AS MUCH AS 1% OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES OR NET INCOME. AT JANUARY 31, 2001 AND 2000, INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT LONG LIVED ASSETS, PRIMARILY PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND

FOUND ON PAGE 20 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR SEGMENTS.

GENERAL.

OPERATING FORMATS VARY BY COUNTRY, BUT INCLUDE WAL-MART DISCOUNT STORES IN CANADA AND PUERTO RICO;

SUPERCENTERS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, KOREA, MEXICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM; SAM'S CLUBS IN BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, AND PUERTO RICO; HYPERMARKETS IN GERMANY; SUPERAMAS (TRADITIONAL SUPERMARKET), BODEGAS (DISCOUNT STORE), AURRERAS (COMBINATION

STORE), SUBURBIAS (SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE) AND VIPS (RESTAURANT) IN MEXICO AND ASDA STORES (COMBINATION GROCERY AND APPAREL STORE) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

MERCHANDISE.

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF DOMESTIC

SEGMENTS IN THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF SALES, SEVERAL STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN

WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL VENDORS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS.

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE INTERNATIONAL DIVISION VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY

INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WHILE SALES ARE PRIMARILY ON A CASH-AND-CARRY BASIS, CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO

FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT'S BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN THE COMPANY'S FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC

CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION.

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN

THE DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY, SPECIALTY AND WHOLESALE SECTORS OF THE RETAIL MARKET. THE SEGMENT'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IS DETERMINED, TO A LARGE EXTENT, BY ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS

EXCEPTIONAL VALUE. IN SUPERCENTERS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES EXPORT CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA;

JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA; SEATTLE, WASHINGTON; AND LAREDO, TEXAS IN SUPPORT OF PRODUCT FLOW TO ITS MEXICAN, ASIAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS. 37 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, GERMANY, PUERTO RICO, THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND MEXICO. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES THE COMPANY PROCESSES AND DISTRIBUTES BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC PRODUCT TO THE OPERATING UNITS. DURING FISCAL 2001, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE INTERNATIONAL MERCHANDISE PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. THE BALANCE WAS SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE STORES FROM SUPPLIERS. A COMBINATION OF COMPANY

OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES COMPRISES THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS.

OTHER
