other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national chains. wal-mart supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of which are national or
regional chains. the company also competes with others for new store sites. as of january 31, 2001, based on net sales, the wal-mart stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains and among all discount department store
chains.
the company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers. the company has many programs designed to meet the competitive pressures within its industry. these include the company's "everyday low price", "item
merchandising", "store-within-a-store" "price rollbacks", and "store of the community" programs. although the company believes it has had a major influence in most of the retail markets in which its stores are
located, there is no assurance that this influence will continue.

the wal-mart discount stores' and supercenters' purchases were shipped from wal-mart's 55 distribution centers, 16 of which are grocery distribution centers, and three of which are import distribution centers. the balance of merchandise purchased

found on page 20 of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.

store), suburbias (specialty department store) and vips (restaurant) in mexico and asda stores (combination grocery and apparel store) in the united kingdom.
merchandise.the merchandising strategy for the international operating segment is similar to that of domestic
segments in the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in
which the international segment operates. in addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.
operations.the hours of operation for operating units in the international division vary by country and by
individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. while sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.
seasonal aspects of operations.the international operating segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.
generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the company's fourth fiscal quarter. the seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic
conditions.
competition.the international operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in
the discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market. the segment's competitive position is determined, to a large extent, by its ability to offer its customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers
exceptional value. in supercenters, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on the segment's competitive position in the markets where we operate.
distribution.the international segment operates export consolidation facilities in los angeles, california;
jacksonville, florida; seattle, washington; and laredo, texas in support of product flow to its mexican, asian, and latin american markets. 37 distribution facilities are located in argentina, brazil, canada, china, germany, puerto rico, the united
kingdom and mexico. through these facilities the company processes and distributes both imported and domestic product to the operating units. during fiscal 2001, approximately 70% of the international merchandise purchases flowed through these
distribution facilities. the balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. a combination of company
owned and operated facilities and third-party facilities comprises the overall distribution structure for international logistics.

item 2. properties
the number and location of domestic and international wal-mart discount stores, supercenters and sam's
clubs is incorporated by reference to the table under the caption "fiscal 2001 end of year store counts" on page 6 of the annual report to shareholders for the year ended january 31, 2001.
the company owns 1,380 of the properties on which domestic discount stores
and supercenters are located and 282 of the properties on which domestic sam's clubs are located. in some cases, the company owns the land associated with leased buildings. new buildings, both leased and owned, are constructed by independent
contractors.
the remaining buildings in which its present domestic locations are located are either leased from a
commercial property developer, leased pursuant to a sale/leaseback arrangement or leased from a local governmental entity through an industrial revenue bond transaction. all of the company's leases for its stores provide for fixed annual rentals
and, in many cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.
domestically, the company operated 55 wal-mart distribution facilities and 33 mclane distribution
facilities as of january 31, 2001. with the exception of the ameriserve facilities, the company primarily owns these distribution facilities, and several are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans. some of the distribution facilities are
leased under industrial development bond financing arrangements and provide the option of purchasing these facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal amounts.
the company owns office facilities in bentonville, arkansas that serve as the home office for the
company and an office facility in temple, texas which serves as the home office for mclane.
internationally, the company has a combination of owned and leased
properties in each country in which the operating units are located. the company owns eight properties in argentina, 13 properties in brazil, 14 properties in canada, one property in china through joint venture, 19 properties in germany, six
properties in korea, 212 properties in mexico, four properties in puerto rico and 158 properties in the united kingdom in which the operating units are located, with the remaining units in each country being leased.
the company utilizes both owned and leased properties for office
facilities in each country in which it conducts business.
item 3. legal proceedings
the company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.
neither the company nor any of its properties is subject to
any material pending legal proceeding, other than routine litigation incidental to the company's business.
the company recently opened a supercenter in honesdale, pennsylvania. in february 1999, the
company settled claims made by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (pdep) that a subcontractor's acts and omissions relating to the construction of the supercenter led to excess erosion and sedimentation of a nearby creek. in the
settlement, the company agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the honesdale area. the company is negotiating settlement of a claim by the united states army corps of engineers that the
construction resulted in the filling of approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at the site. the proposed settlement with the corps will require the company to pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for
the purchase of local wetlands conservation areas and easements. the company has been reimbursed for these amounts by the contractor on the project.
the united states environmental protection agency (epa) is threatening to bring suit against
the company and five of its contractors over alleged violations of a 1992 storm water permit issued with respect to various wal-mart development sites in texas, new mexico and oklahoma. the epa has presented the company with penalty calculations of
$5.6 million.
during the fiscal 2001, the state of connecticut filed suit against the company in the state
of connecticut superior court for the judicial district of hartford for various violations of state environmental laws alleging the company failed to adequately permit and or maintain records relating to storm water management practices at 12
stores. the suit seeks to ensure the company's compliance with the general permit for the discharge of stormwater associated with those stores. the company will vigorously defend against these allegations.
