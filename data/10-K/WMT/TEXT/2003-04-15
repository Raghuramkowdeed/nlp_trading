item 1.business
general.
we are the worlds largest retailer
as measured by total revenues. during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2003, we had net
sales of $244.5 billion. we maintain our principal offices at 702 s.w. 8th
street, bentonville, arkansas 72716.
although wal-mart stores, inc. was
incorporated in delaware in october 1969, the businesses conducted by our predecessors
began in 1945 when sam m. walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport,
arkansas. in 1946, his brother, james l. walton, opened a similar store in versailles,
missouri. until 1962, our predecessors business was devoted entirely to the
operation of variety stores. in that year, the first wal-mart discount city, which was a
discount store, was opened. in fiscal 1984, we opened our first three sams clubs,
and in fiscal 1988, our first wal-mart supercenter, a format that combines a full-line
supermarket with a general merchandise discount store. we currently operate in all 50
states in the united states.
in fiscal 1992, we began our first
international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico, in which we had a
50% interest, with cifra s.a. de c.v. in fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest
in cifra as described below, and in february 2000, cifra officially changed its name to
wal-mart de mexico, s.a. de c.v. since fiscal 1992, our international presence has
continued to expand and at january 31, 2003, we had international operations in argentina,
brazil, canada, germany, south korea, mexico, puerto rico and the united kingdom, through
joint venture agreements, in china and through a minority investment in japan.
the development of our company in recent years.
at january 31, 2003, we operated in the
united states, 1,568 discount stores, 1,258 supercenters, 525 sams clubs and 49
neighborhood markets. internationally, at january 31, 2003, the company operated units in
argentina (11), brazil (22), canada (213), germany (94), south korea (15), mexico (597),
puerto rico (52) and the united kingdom (258), and, under joint venture agreements, in
china (26). additionally, we hold, on a fully diluted basis, a 35% interest in the seiyu,
ltd., a japanese retail chain.
our growth, measured both by our net
sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of the increase in the number of
stores we have, both in the united states and internationally, and the increase from year
to year of the sales in our existing stores. the following tables provide summary
information concerning the additions of units and square footage for domestic discount
stores, supercenters, sams clubs, neighborhood markets and international units in
each of our fiscal years from 1999 through 2003.

fiscal 2002 net additions contain an
adjustment to the previously reported square footage based on a reassessment of the
various foreign country totals. this adjustment has been made to state the total square
footage amounts at january 31, 2002. the adjustments made on an individual country basis
are: for canada a reduction of 21,506 square feet, for china an increase of 27,849 square
feet, for germany an increase of 4,419,932 square feet, for south korea an increase of
300,645 square feet, for mexico an increase of 4,293,932 square feet and for the united
kingdom an increase of 134,088 square feet. no adjustments were made to the square footage
previously reported in argentina, brazil and puerto rico as a result of the reassessment.
much of our growth internationally in
recent years has resulted from our acquisition of existing operations in various
countries. in the third quarter of fiscal 1998, we acquired approximately 51% of the
voting shares in wal-mart de mexico, which was formerly known as "cifra," by
means of a tender offer pursuant to which we acquired a total of 593,100,000 shares of
wal-mart de mexicos voting stock and a merger of certain joint ventures between us
and wal-mart de mexico into wal-mart de mexico. we acquired another 1,609,000,000 shares
of wal-mart de mexicos voting stock pursuant to that merger. we paid a total of
approximately us$1.2 billion for the shares of cifra voting stock acquired in the tender
offer. in fiscal 2001, we purchased an additional 271.3 million shares of stock in
wal-mart de mexico from other shareholders of wal-mart de mexico at a cost of
approximately $587 million. as a result of that acquisition, wal-mart de mexicos
share repurchase program and a stock dividend paid by wal-mart de mexico, we held
approximately 62% of the outstanding voting shares of wal-mart de mexico at the end of
fiscal 2003.
page 8 of 26
in the third quarter of fiscal, 2000, we
acquired all of the stock of asda group plc, the third largest retailer in the united
kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately us$11 billion. asda had 229 stores at the
time of the acquisition. the acquisition of asda marked our entry into the united kingdom.
in december 2002, the company exercised
in full the first in the series of warrants we had acquired that allow us to acquire
192,800,000 new shares in seiyu for approximately $432 million. after this exercise, our
ownership percentage in seiyu increased to approximately 35% on a fully diluted basis. if
we exercise all of the warrants we acquired at a cost of 260 billion yen or $2.1 billion
at an exchange rate of 124 yen per u.s. dollar, we will own approximately 66.7% of the
stock of seiyu. also, in december 2002, the company completed its purchase of
supermercados amigo, inc. (amigo), a supermarket chain located in puerto rico with 37
supermarkets at the time of the acquisition. four of the supermarkets were subsequently
sold, and two are currently in the process of being sold.
we have provided additional information regarding the accounting
treatment of certain of the acquisitions discussed above in note 6 of notes to
consolidated financial statements, which appear in our annual report to shareholders, are
incorporated by reference herein and have been included as an exhibit to this annual
report.

operationshours
of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores are
24 hours each day. hours of operation for the remaining discount stores vary by location,
but generally range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m. on sundays. wal-mart discount stores and supercenters maintain uniform prices,
except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. sales are primarily on
a self-service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and
inventory turnover while minimizing expenses. bank credit card programs, operated without
recourse to the company, are available in all stores.
seasonal aspects of operationsthe
wal-mart stores operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent.
generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes
the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.
competitionour
wal-mart discount stores compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and
specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national chains. our wal-mart
supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and
specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. we also compete with
others for new store sites. as of january 31, 2003, based on net sales, the wal-mart
stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains and among all
discount department store chains.
our ability to offer value and
service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail
industry. we employ many programs designed to meet the competitive pressures within our
industry. these include our "everyday low price,"
"store-within-a-store," "price rollbacks," and "store of the
community" programs. although we believe we have had a major influence in most of the
retail markets in which our stores are located, we cannot assure you that this influence
will continue.

members of certain qualifying organizations, such as federal and state government
employees and credit union members. in fiscal 2003, business members paid an annual
membership fee of $30 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no
additional cost. the annual membership fee for an individual member is $35 for the primary

mentioned above under the sams club elite membership program, an extended array of
new services including insurance services, credit card processing, payroll processing,
dental discount networks and extended service agreements.
seasonal aspects of operationsthe
sams club operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent.
generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes
the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.
competitionsams
clubs compete with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, wholesale
grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. we also compete with others
for new club sites. our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise determines our
competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

distributionduring
fiscal 2003, approximately 63% of the sams club purchases were shipped from the
sams clubs segments dedicated distribution facilities. suppliers shipped the
balance of the sams club purchases directly to the sams clubs locations.
the principal focus of our sams clubs distribution operations is on
crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. a combination of seven company
owned and operated facilities and 12 third-party owned and operated facilities constitute
the overall distribution structure for the sams club segment. two of the company
owned and operated facilities are located in texas with one located in each of arizona,
arkansas, colorado, minnesota and indiana. of the third party owned and operated
facilities, one of each is located in each of california, florida, georgia, illinois,
maryland, michigan, missouri, new hampshire, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania and

freezer/cooler facilities which service both wal-mart stores and sams clubs, four
wal-mart owned specialty distribution facilities which service both wal-mart stores and
sams clubs and one third-party owned freezer/cooler facility.
international operating segment
our international segment comprises our
operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in argentina, canada, germany, south korea,
puerto rico and the united kingdom; our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in
brazil and mexico; our operations through joint ventures in china and, through a minority
ownership interest, in japan. the international segments net sales for the three
fiscal years ended january 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, were $40.8 billion, $35.5 billion and
$32.1 billion, respectively. during the most recent fiscal year, no single location
accounted for as much as 1% of total company sales or net income.

formats vary by country, but include wal-mart discount stores in canada and puerto rico;
supercenters in argentina, brazil, china, germany, south korea, mexico, puerto rico and
the united kingdom; sams clubs in brazil, china, mexico, and puerto rico; superamas

store) and vips (restaurant) in mexico; todo dias (traditional supermarket) in brazil;
neighborhood markets (traditional supermarkets) in china; asda stores (combination grocery
and apparel store) in the united kingdom; and amigo supermarkets in puerto rico.
merchandisethe
merchandising strategy for the international operating segment is similar to that of
domestic segments in the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the
united states have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the
international segment operates. in addition, steps have been taken to develop
relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality
merchandise.
operationsthe
hours of operation for operating units in the international segment vary by country and by
individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances
governing hours of operation. while sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit
cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the
purchase of goods by the customer.
seasonal aspects of operationsthe
international operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent.
generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. the
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.
competitionthe
international operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and
international chains in the discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale
sectors of the retail market in each of the countries in which we operate and, in mexico,
with local, national and international restaurant chains. our ability to offer our
customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the
international segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. in our
international supercenters, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a
major impact on the segments competitive position in the markets where we operate.
distributionthe
international segment operates export consolidation facilities in los angeles, california;
jacksonville, florida; and laredo, texas in support of product flow to its mexican, asian,
and latin american markets. we operate a total of 43 distribution facilities that are
located in argentina, brazil, canada, china, germany, puerto rico, the united kingdom and
mexico. through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic
product to the operating units. during fiscal 2003, approximately 76% of the international
merchandise purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. suppliers ship the
balance of the international segments merchandise purchases directly to our stores
in the various countries in which we operate. a combination of company owned and operated facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall
distribution structure for international logistics.

in february 1999, the company settled
claims made by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (pdep)
regarding a store in honesdale, pennsylvania. the pdep alleged that a subcontractors

sedimentation of a nearby creek. in the settlement, the company agreed to pay a fine of
$25,000 and to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the honesdale area.
the company is negotiating a settlement of a claim by the united states army corps of
engineers that the construction of the honesdale store resulted in the filling of
approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at
the site. the proposed settlement with the corps of engineers would require the company to
pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for the purchase of local wetlands conservation
areas and easements. the contractor on the project has reimbursed the company for the
amounts paid in connection with the settlement matter.
