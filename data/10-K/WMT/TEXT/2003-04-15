ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2003

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL.

WE ARE THE WORLDS LARGEST RETAILER

AS MEASURED BY TOTAL REVENUES. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2003, WE HAD NET

SALES OF $244.5 BILLION. WE MAINTAIN OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES AT 702 S.W. 8

TH

STREET, BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS 72716.

ALTHOUGH WAL-MART STORES, INC. WAS

INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN OCTOBER 1969, THE BUSINESSES CONDUCTED BY OUR PREDECESSORS

BEGAN IN 1945 WHEN SAM M. WALTON OPENED A FRANCHISE BEN FRANKLIN VARIETY STORE IN NEWPORT,

ARKANSAS. IN 1946, HIS BROTHER, JAMES L. WALTON, OPENED A SIMILAR STORE IN VERSAILLES,

MISSOURI. UNTIL 1962, OUR PREDECESSORS BUSINESS WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE

OPERATION OF VARIETY STORES. IN THAT YEAR, THE FIRST WAL-MART DISCOUNT CITY, WHICH WAS A

DISCOUNT STORE, WAS OPENED. IN FISCAL 1984, WE OPENED OUR FIRST THREE SAMS CLUBS,

AND IN FISCAL 1988, OUR FIRST WAL-MART SUPERCENTER, A FORMAT THAT COMBINES A FULL-LINE

SUPERMARKET WITH A GENERAL MERCHANDISE DISCOUNT STORE. WE CURRENTLY OPERATE IN ALL 50

STATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN FISCAL 1992, WE BEGAN OUR FIRST

INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE WHEN WE ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE IN MEXICO, IN WHICH WE HAD A

50% INTEREST, WITH CIFRA S.A. DE C.V. IN FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED THE CONTROLLING INTEREST

IN CIFRA AS DESCRIBED BELOW, AND IN FEBRUARY 2000, CIFRA OFFICIALLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO

WAL-MART DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. SINCE FISCAL 1992, OUR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE HAS

CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND AT JANUARY 31, 2003, WE HAD INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA,

BRAZIL, CANADA, GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, THROUGH

JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS, IN CHINA AND THROUGH A MINORITY INVESTMENT IN JAPAN.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COMPANY IN RECENT YEARS.

AT JANUARY 31, 2003, WE OPERATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, 1,568 DISCOUNT STORES, 1,258 SUPERCENTERS, 525 SAMS CLUBS AND 49

NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS. INTERNATIONALLY, AT JANUARY 31, 2003, THE COMPANY OPERATED UNITS IN

ARGENTINA (11), BRAZIL (22), CANADA (213), GERMANY (94), SOUTH KOREA (15), MEXICO (597),

PUERTO RICO (52) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (258), AND, UNDER JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS, IN

CHINA (26). ADDITIONALLY, WE HOLD, ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS, A 35% INTEREST IN THE SEIYU,

LTD., A JAPANESE RETAIL CHAIN.

OUR GROWTH, MEASURED BOTH BY OUR NET

SALES AND NET INCOME, OCCURS IN LARGE MEASURE AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

STORES WE HAVE, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, AND THE INCREASE FROM YEAR

TO YEAR OF THE SALES IN OUR EXISTING STORES. THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE SUMMARY

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ADDITIONS OF UNITS AND SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR DOMESTIC DISCOUNT

STORES, SUPERCENTERS, SAMS CLUBS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND INTERNATIONAL UNITS IN

EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS FROM 1999 THROUGH 2003.

FISCAL 2002 NET ADDITIONS CONTAIN AN

ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SQUARE FOOTAGE BASED ON A REASSESSMENT OF THE

VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRY TOTALS. THIS ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN MADE TO STATE THE TOTAL SQUARE

FOOTAGE AMOUNTS AT JANUARY 31, 2002. THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY BASIS

ARE: FOR CANADA A REDUCTION OF 21,506 SQUARE FEET, FOR CHINA AN INCREASE OF 27,849 SQUARE

FEET, FOR GERMANY AN INCREASE OF 4,419,932 SQUARE FEET, FOR SOUTH KOREA AN INCREASE OF

300,645 SQUARE FEET, FOR MEXICO AN INCREASE OF 4,293,932 SQUARE FEET AND FOR THE UNITED

KINGDOM AN INCREASE OF 134,088 SQUARE FEET. NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL AND PUERTO RICO AS A RESULT OF THE REASSESSMENT.

MUCH OF OUR GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY IN

RECENT YEARS HAS RESULTED FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE

VOTING SHARES IN WAL-MART DE MEXICO, WHICH WAS FORMERLY KNOWN AS "CIFRA," BY

MEANS OF A TENDER OFFER PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACQUIRED A TOTAL OF 593,100,000 SHARES OF

WAL-MART DE MEXICOS VOTING STOCK AND A MERGER OF CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES BETWEEN US

AND WAL-MART DE MEXICO INTO WAL-MART DE MEXICO. WE ACQUIRED ANOTHER 1,609,000,000 SHARES

OF WAL-MART DE MEXICOS VOTING STOCK PURSUANT TO THAT MERGER. WE PAID A TOTAL OF

APPROXIMATELY US$1.2 BILLION FOR THE SHARES OF CIFRA VOTING STOCK ACQUIRED IN THE TENDER

OFFER. IN FISCAL 2001, WE PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 271.3 MILLION SHARES OF STOCK IN

WAL-MART DE MEXICO FROM OTHER SHAREHOLDERS OF WAL-MART DE MEXICO AT A COST OF

APPROXIMATELY $587 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THAT ACQUISITION, WAL-MART DE MEXICOS

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND A STOCK DIVIDEND PAID BY WAL-MART DE MEXICO, WE HELD

APPROXIMATELY 62% OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES OF WAL-MART DE MEXICO AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2003.

PAGE 8 OF 26

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL, 2000, WE

ACQUIRED ALL OF THE STOCK OF ASDA GROUP PLC, THE THIRD LARGEST RETAILER IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY US$11 BILLION. ASDA HAD 229 STORES AT THE

TIME OF THE ACQUISITION. THE ACQUISITION OF ASDA MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY EXERCISED

IN FULL THE FIRST IN THE SERIES OF WARRANTS WE HAD ACQUIRED THAT ALLOW US TO ACQUIRE

192,800,000 NEW SHARES IN SEIYU FOR APPROXIMATELY $432 MILLION. AFTER THIS EXERCISE, OUR

OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE IN SEIYU INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY 35% ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS. IF

WE EXERCISE ALL OF THE WARRANTS WE ACQUIRED AT A COST OF 260 BILLION YEN OR $2.1 BILLION

AT AN EXCHANGE RATE OF 124 YEN PER U.S. DOLLAR, WE WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 66.7% OF THE

STOCK OF SEIYU. ALSO, IN DECEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF

DISTRIBUTION

DURING

FISCAL 2003, APPROXIMATELY 63% OF THE SAMS CLUB PURCHASES WERE SHIPPED FROM THE

SAMS CLUBS SEGMENTS DEDICATED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. SUPPLIERS SHIPPED THE

BALANCE OF THE SAMS CLUB PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO THE SAMS CLUBS LOCATIONS.

THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF OUR SAMS CLUBS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS IS ON

CROSSDOCKING PRODUCT, WHILE STORED INVENTORY IS MINIMIZED. A COMBINATION OF SEVEN COMPANY

OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES AND 12 THIRD-PARTY OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES CONSTITUTE

THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE FOR THE SAMS CLUB SEGMENT. TWO OF THE COMPANY

GENERAL

OPERATING

FORMATS VARY BY COUNTRY, BUT INCLUDE WAL-MART DISCOUNT STORES IN CANADA AND PUERTO RICO;

MERCHANDISE

THE

MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF

DOMESTIC SEGMENTS IN THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND

NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF SALES, SEVERAL STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE

UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP

RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY

MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS

THE

HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY

INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES

GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WHILE SALES ARE PRIMARILY ON A CASH-AND-CARRY BASIS, CREDIT

CARDS OR OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE

PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS

THE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE

SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS

HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION

THE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN THE DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY, SPECIALTY AND WHOLESALE

SECTORS OF THE RETAIL MARKET IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN MEXICO,

WITH LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT CHAINS. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR

CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL SUPERCENTERS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A

MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENTS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION

THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES EXPORT CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA;

JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA; AND LAREDO, TEXAS IN SUPPORT OF PRODUCT FLOW TO ITS MEXICAN, ASIAN,

AND LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS. WE OPERATE A TOTAL OF 43 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE

LOCATED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, GERMANY, PUERTO RICO, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

MEXICO. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, WE PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC

PRODUCT TO THE OPERATING UNITS. DURING FISCAL 2003, APPROXIMATELY 76% OF THE INTERNATIONAL

MERCHANDISE PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. SUPPLIERS SHIP THE

BALANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO OUR STORES

IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. A COMBINATION OF COMPANY

OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES MAKES UP THE OVERALL

DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS.

ITEM 103 OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSIONS REGULATION S-K REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT FOR THE

PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY IS A PARTY AND IN

WHICH THE POTENTIAL MONETARY SANCTIONS INVOLVED EXCEED $100,000. WE ARE DISCLOSING THE

FOLLOWING ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITEM 103.

IN FEBRUARY 1999, THE COMPANY SETTLED

CLAIMS MADE BY THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PDEP)

REGARDING A STORE IN HONESDALE, PENNSYLVANIA. THE PDEP ALLEGED THAT A SUBCONTRACTORS

ACTS AND OMISSIONS RELATING TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STORE LED TO EXCESS EROSION AND

SEDIMENTATION OF A NEARBY CREEK. IN THE SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO PAY A FINE OF

$25,000 AND TO PERFORM A $75,000 COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT IN THE HONESDALE AREA.

THE COMPANY IS NEGOTIATING A SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM BY THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF

ENGINEERS THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HONESDALE STORE RESULTED IN THE FILLING OF

APPROXIMATELY 0.76 ACRES IN EXCESS OF THE PERMITTED FILL AREA OF WATERS AND WETLANDS AT

THE SITE. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

PAY $200,000 TO A NON-PROFIT CORPORATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF LOCAL WETLANDS CONSERVATION

AREAS AND EASEMENTS. THE CONTRACTOR ON THE PROJECT HAS REIMBURSED THE COMPANY FOR THE

AMOUNTS PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT MATTER.

DURING FISCAL 2001, THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT FILED SUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT SUPERIOR COURT FOR

THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF HARTFORD ALLEGING VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE PERMITS OR FAILED TO

MAINTAIN REQUIRED RECORDS RELATING TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT 12 STORES. THE

SUIT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE COMPANYS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PERMIT FOR THE

DISCHARGE OF STORMWATER ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE STORES.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

NO MATTERS WERE SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF THE COMPANYS

SECURITY HOLDERS DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2003.
