ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL.

WE ARE THE WORLDS LARGEST RETAILER AS MEASURED BY TOTAL REVENUES.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2002, WE HAD NET SALES OF $217.8 BILLION. WE

MAINTAIN OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES AT 702 S.W. 8

TH

STREET, BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS

72716.

ALTHOUGH WAL-MART STORES, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN OCTOBER

1969, THE BUSINESSES CONDUCTED BY OUR PREDECESSORS BEGAN IN 1945 WHEN SAM M. WALTON OPENED

A FRANCHISE BEN FRANKLIN VARIETY STORE IN NEWPORT, ARKANSAS. IN 1946, HIS BROTHER, JAMES

L. WALTON, OPENED A SIMILAR STORE IN VERSAILLES, MISSOURI. UNTIL 1962, OUR

PREDECESSORS BUSINESS WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE OPERATION OF VARIETY STORES. IN

THAT YEAR, THE FIRST WAL-MART DISCOUNT CITY, WHICH WAS A DISCOUNT STORE, WAS OPENED. IN

FISCAL 1984, WE OPENED OUR FIRST THREE SAMS CLUBS, AND IN FISCAL 1988, OUR FIRST

WAL-MART SUPERCENTER, A FORMAT THAT COMBINES A FULL-LINE SUPERMARKET WITH A GENERAL

MERCHANDISE DISCOUNT STORE. WE CURRENTLY OPERATE IN ALL 50 STATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN FISCAL 1992, WE BEGAN OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE WHEN WE

ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE IN MEXICO, IN WHICH WE HAD A 50% INTEREST, WITH CIFRA S.A. DE

C.V. IN FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED THE CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CIFRA AS DESCRIBED BELOW, AND

IN FEBRUARY 2000, CIFRA OFFICIALLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO WAL-MART DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V.

SINCE FISCAL 1992, OUR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND AT JANUARY 31,

2002, WE HAD INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA,

MEXICO, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND, THROUGH JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS, IN

CHINA.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COMPANY IN RECENT YEARS.

AT JANUARY 31, 2002, WE OPERATED IN THE UNITED STATES, 1,647 DISCOUNT

STORES, 1,066 SUPERCENTERS, 500 SAMS CLUBS AND 31 NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS.

INTERNATIONALLY, AT JANUARY 31, 2002, THE COMPANY OPERATED UNITS IN ARGENTINA (11), BRAZIL

(22), CANADA (196), GERMANY (95), SOUTH KOREA (9) MEXICO (551), PUERTO RICO (17) AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM (250), AND, UNDER JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS, IN CHINA (19). OUR GROWTH,

MEASURED BOTH BY OUR NET SALES AND NET INCOME, OCCURS IN LARGE MEASURE AS A RESULT OF THE

INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STORES WE HAVE, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY,

AND THE INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR OF THE SALES IN OUR EXISTING STORES. THE FOLLOWING

TABLES PROVIDE SUMMARY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ADDITIONS OF UNITS AND SQUARE FOOTAGE

FOR DOMESTIC DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS, SAMS CLUBS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND

INTERNATIONAL UNITS IN EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS FROM 1997 THROUGH 2002.

FISCAL 2002 NET ADDITIONS CONTAIN AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED SQUARE FOOTAGE BASED ON A REASSESSMENT OF THE VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRY TOTALS.

THIS ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN MADE TO STATE THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE AMOUNTS AT JANUARY 31,

2002. THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE ON AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY BASIS ARE: FOR CANADA A REDUCTION OF

21,506 SQUARE FEET, FOR CHINA AN INCREASE OF 27,849 SQUARE FEET, FOR GERMANY AN INCREASE

OF 4,419,932 SQUARE FEET, FOR SOUTH KOREA AN INCREASE OF 300,645 SQUARE FEET, FOR MEXICO

AN INCREASE OF 4,293,932 SQUARE FEET AND FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM AN INCREASE OF 134,088

SQUARE FEET. NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN

ARGENTINA, BRAZIL AND PUERTO RICO AS A RESULT OF THE REASSESSMENT.

MUCH OF OUR GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY IN RECENT YEARS HAS RESULTED FROM

OUR ACQUISITION OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE VOTING SHARES IN WAL-MART DE MEXICO,

WHICH WAS FORMERLY KNOWN AS "CIFRA," BY MEANS OF A TENDER OFFER PURSUANT TO

WHICH WE ACQUIRED A TOTAL OF 593,100,000 SHARES OF WAL-MART DE MEXICOS VOTING STOCK

AND A MERGER OF CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES BETWEEN US AND WAL-MART DE MEXICO INTO WAL-MART DE

MEXICO. WE ACQUIRED ANOTHER 1,609,000,000 SHARES OF WAL-MART DE MEXICOS VOTING STOCK

PURSUANT TO THAT MERGER. WE PAID A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY US$1.2 BILLION FOR THE SHARES OF

CIFRA VOTING STOCK ACQUIRED IN THE TENDER OFFER. IN FISCAL 2001, WE PURCHASED AN

ADDITIONAL 271.3 MILLION SHARES OF STOCK IN WAL-MART DE MEXICO FROM OTHER SHAREHOLDERS OF

WAL-MART DE MEXICO AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $587 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THAT

ACQUISITION AND WAL-MART DE MEXICOS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE HOLD APPROXIMATELY

61.4% OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES OF WAL-MART DE MEXICO AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002.

PAGE 8 OF 23

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL, 2000, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE STOCK OF

ASDA GROUP PLC, THE THIRD LARGEST RETAILER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF

APPROXIMATELY US$11 BILLION. ASDA HAD 229 STORES AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION. THE

ACQUISITION OF ASDA MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

WE ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 14, 2002, THAT WE INTEND TO ACQUIRE 6.1% OF THE

STOCK OF THE SEIYU LTD., A JAPANESE RETAIL CHAIN, FOR 6 BILLION YEN, OR APPROXIMATELY $46

MILLION BASED ON AN EXCHANGE RATE OF 130 YEN PER UNITED STATES DOLLAR. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION, WE WILL ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO 260 BILLION YEN,

OR APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE DISCUSSED ABOVE, FOR ADDITIONAL

SHARES OF STOCK IN SEIYU. IF WE CONTRIBUTE THE FULL 260 BILLION YEN TO SEIYU, WE WILL OWN

MERCHANDISE.

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF DOMESTIC SEGMENTS IN THE BREADTH AND

SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A

MAJORITY OF SALES, SEVERAL STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES.

IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH

COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS.

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES,

DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WHILE SALES ARE

PRIMARILY ON A CASH-AND-CARRY BASIS, CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST

IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INTERNATIONAL

OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST

VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN THE COMPANYS FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SEASONALITY OF THE

BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND

CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

DRUG, VARIETY, SPECIALTY AND WHOLESALE SECTORS OF THE RETAIL MARKET IN EACH OF THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN MEXICO, WITH LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

RESTAURANT CHAINS. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE

THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT,

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SUPERCENTERS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY

OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENTS COMPETITIVE POSITION

IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

PAGE 12 OF 23

DISTRIBUTION.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES EXPORT

CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA; AND LAREDO,

UNITS. DURING FISCAL 2002, APPROXIMATELY 71% OF THE INTERNATIONAL MERCHANDISE PURCHASES

FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. SUPPLIERS SHIP THE BALANCE OF THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO OUR STORES IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. A COMBINATION OF COMPANY

OWNED AND

OPERATED FACILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES MAKES UP THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE

FOR INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO NOR ARE ANY OF OUR PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO ANY

MATERIAL PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDING OTHER THAN ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS.

WE RECENTLY OPENED A SUPERCENTER IN

HONESDALE, PENNSYLVANIA. IN FEBRUARY 1999, WE SETTLED CLAIMS MADE BY THE PENNSYLVANIA

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PDEP) THAT A SUBCONTRACTORS ACTS AND

OMISSIONS RELATING TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUPERCENTER LED TO EXCESS EROSION AND

SEDIMENTATION OF A NEARBY CREEK. IN THE SETTLEMENT, WE AGREED TO PAY A FINE OF $25,000 AND

TO PERFORM A $75,000 COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT IN THE HONESDALE AREA. WE ARE

NEGOTIATING A SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM BY THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS THAT THE

CONSTRUCTION RESULTED IN THE FILLING OF APPROXIMATELY 0.76 ACRES IN EXCESS OF THE

PERMITTED FILL AREA OF WATERS AND WETLANDS AT THE SITE. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH THE

CORPS OF ENGINEERS WOULD REQUIRE US TO PAY $200,000 TO A NON-PROFIT CORPORATION FOR THE

PURCHASE OF LOCAL WETLANDS CONSERVATION AREAS AND EASEMENTS. THE CONTRACTOR ON THE PROJECT

HAS REIMBURSED US FOR THE AMOUNTS WE HAVE PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER.

DURING FISCAL 2001, THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT FILED SUIT AGAINST US IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE

JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF HARTFORD ALLEGING VARIOUS VIOLATIONS OF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

ALLEGING THAT WE FAILED TO OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE PERMITS OR MAINTAIN REQUIRED RECORDS

RELATING TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT 12 STORES. THE SUIT SEEKS TO ENSURE OUR

COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PERMIT FOR THE DISCHARGE OF STORMWATER ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

STORES. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE ALLEGATIONS.
