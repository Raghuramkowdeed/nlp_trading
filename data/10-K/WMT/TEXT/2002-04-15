part i
item 1.business
general.
we are the worlds largest retailer as measured by total revenues.
during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2002, we had net sales of $217.8 billion. we
maintain our principal offices at 702 s.w. 8th street, bentonville, arkansas
72716.
although wal-mart stores, inc. was incorporated in delaware in october
1969, the businesses conducted by our predecessors began in 1945 when sam m. walton opened
a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport, arkansas. in 1946, his brother, james
l. walton, opened a similar store in versailles, missouri. until 1962, our
predecessors business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. in
that year, the first wal-mart discount city, which was a discount store, was opened. in
fiscal 1984, we opened our first three sams clubs, and in fiscal 1988, our first
wal-mart supercenter, a format that combines a full-line supermarket with a general
merchandise discount store. we currently operate in all 50 states in the united states.
in fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we
entered into a joint venture in mexico, in which we had a 50% interest, with cifra s.a. de
c.v. in fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in cifra as described below, and
in february 2000, cifra officially changed its name to wal-mart de mexico, s.a. de c.v.
since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand and at january 31,
2002, we had international operations in argentina, brazil, canada, germany, south korea,
mexico, puerto rico and the united kingdom and, through joint venture agreements, in
china.
the development of our company in recent years.
at january 31, 2002, we operated in the united states, 1,647 discount
stores, 1,066 supercenters, 500 sams clubs and 31 neighborhood markets.
internationally, at january 31, 2002, the company operated units in argentina (11), brazil
(22), canada (196), germany (95), south korea (9) mexico (551), puerto rico (17) and the
united kingdom (250), and, under joint venture agreements, in china (19). our growth,
measured both by our net sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of the
increase in the number of stores we have, both in the united states and internationally,
and the increase from year to year of the sales in our existing stores. the following
tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage
for domestic discount stores, supercenters, sams clubs, neighborhood markets and
international units in each of our fiscal years from 1997 through 2002.

fiscal 2002 net additions contain an adjustment to the previously
reported square footage based on a reassessment of the various foreign country totals.
this adjustment has been made to state the total square footage amounts at january 31,
2002. the adjustments made on an individual country basis are: for canada a reduction of
21,506 square feet, for china an increase of 27,849 square feet, for germany an increase
of 4,419,932 square feet, for south korea an increase of 300,645 square feet, for mexico
an increase of 4,293,932 square feet and for the united kingdom an increase of 134,088
square feet. no adjustments were made to the square footage previously reported in
argentina, brazil and puerto rico as a result of the reassessment.
much of our growth internationally in recent years has resulted from
our acquisition of existing operations in various countries. in the third quarter of
fiscal 1998, we acquired approximately 51% of the voting shares in wal-mart de mexico,
which was formerly known as "cifra," by means of a tender offer pursuant to
which we acquired a total of 593,100,000 shares of wal-mart de mexicos voting stock
and a merger of certain joint ventures between us and wal-mart de mexico into wal-mart de
mexico. we acquired another 1,609,000,000 shares of wal-mart de mexicos voting stock
pursuant to that merger. we paid a total of approximately us$1.2 billion for the shares of
cifra voting stock acquired in the tender offer. in fiscal 2001, we purchased an
additional 271.3 million shares of stock in wal-mart de mexico from other shareholders of
wal-mart de mexico at a cost of approximately $587 million. as a result of that
acquisition and wal-mart de mexicos share repurchase program, we hold approximately
61.4% of the outstanding voting shares of wal-mart de mexico at the end of fiscal 2002.
page 8 of 23
in the third quarter of fiscal, 2000, we acquired all of the stock of
asda group plc, the third largest retailer in the united kingdom, for a purchase price of
approximately us$11 billion. asda had 229 stores at the time of the acquisition. the
acquisition of asda marked our entry into the united kingdom.
we announced on march 14, 2002, that we intend to acquire 6.1% of the
stock of the seiyu ltd., a japanese retail chain, for 6 billion yen, or approximately $46
million based on an exchange rate of 130 yen per united states dollar. under the terms of
the proposed acquisition, we will also have the right to contribute up to 260 billion yen,
or approximately $2 billion, based on the exchange rate discussed above, for additional
shares of stock in seiyu. if we contribute the full 260 billion yen to seiyu, we will own
approximately 66.7% of the stock of seiyu. this transaction is subject to the approval of
seiyus stockholders and other approvals. in addition, in february 2002, we also
announced that we intend to acquire 35 supermercado amigo supermarkets in puerto rico.
that acquisition is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

treatment of certain of the acquisitions discussed above in note 6 of notes to
consolidated financial statements, which appear in our annual report to shareholders, are

distribution. during fiscal 2002, approximately 62.2% of
the sams club purchases were shipped from the sams clubs segments
dedicated distribution facilities. suppliers shipped the balance of the sams club
purchases directly to the sams clubs locations. the principal focus of our

inventory is minimized. a combination of six company owned and operated facilities and 13
third-party owned and operated facilities constitute the overall distribution structure
for the sams club segment. two of the company owned and operated facilities are

(traditional supermarket) in brazil; neighborhood markets (traditional supermarkets) in
south korea and asda stores (combination grocery and apparel store) in the united kingdom.
merchandise. the merchandising strategy for the
international operating segment is similar to that of domestic segments in the breadth and
scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand name merchandise accounts for a
majority of sales, several store brands not found in the united states have been developed
to serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates.
in addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each
country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.
operations. the hours of operation for operating units in
the international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,
depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. while sales are

volume of sales occurs in the companys fourth fiscal quarter. the seasonality of the
business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and

with a variety of local, national and international chains in the discount, department,
drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market in each of the
countries in which we operate and, in mexico, with local, national and international
restaurant chains. our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise
that offers exceptional value in the international segment determines, to a large extent,
our competitive position. in our international supercenters, our ability to effectively
operate the food departments has a major impact on the segments competitive position
in the markets where we operate.

texas in support of product flow to its mexican, asian, and latin american markets. we

units. during fiscal 2002, approximately 71% of the international merchandise purchases
flowed through these distribution facilities. suppliers ship the balance of the
international segments merchandise purchases directly to our stores in the various
countries in which we operate. a combination of company owned and

for international logistics.

domestically, we operated 72 wal-mart distribution facilities and 35
mclane distribution facilities as of january 31, 2002. with the exception of the 16 leased
mclane foodservice distribution facilities, we primarily own these distribution
facilities, several of which are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans obtained to
finance their development. we also lease some of the distribution facilities under
industrial development bond financing arrangements that provide us with the option to
purchase those facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal amounts.
we own the office facilities in bentonville, arkansas that serve as our
home office and corporate headquarters and an office facility in temple, texas that serves
as the home office for mclane. we lease an office facility in brisbane, california that

item 3.legal proceedings
we are not a party to nor are any of our properties subject to any
material pending legal proceeding other than routine litigation incidental to the
companys business.
we recently opened a supercenter in
honesdale, pennsylvania. in february 1999, we settled claims made by the pennsylvania
department of environmental protection (pdep) that a subcontractors acts and
omissions relating to the construction of the supercenter led to excess erosion and
sedimentation of a nearby creek. in the settlement, we agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and
to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the honesdale area. we are
negotiating a settlement of a claim by the united states army corps of engineers that the
construction resulted in the filling of approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the
permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at the site. the proposed settlement with the
corps of engineers would require us to pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for the
purchase of local wetlands conservation areas and easements. the contractor on the project
has reimbursed us for the amounts we have paid in connection with this matter.
during fiscal 2001, the state of
connecticut filed suit against us in the state of connecticut superior court for the
judicial district of hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws and
alleging that we failed to obtain the appropriate permits or maintain required records
relating to storm water management practices at 12 stores. the suit seeks to ensure our
compliance with the general permit for the discharge of stormwater associated with those
stores. we intend to vigorously defend against these allegations.
