our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, domestically and
internationally, that are outside our control. any one, or a combination, of these risks, factors and uncertainties could materially affect our financial performance, our results of operations, including our sales, earnings per share or comparable
store sales or comparable club sales for any period, our effective tax rate, business operations, business strategy, plans, goals and objectives. these factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including changes in the

annual operating income in the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal buying patterns. those buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty and can be affected by many factors. the foregoing list of factors that may affect our
operations and financial performance is not exclusive. other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity
are subject to other risk factors and uncertainties, which we discuss below under the caption item 1a. risk factors, and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations incorporated by

investors and other readers are urged to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements that we make or that are made by others on our behalf are based
on a knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time such forward-looking statements are made, but because of the factors described and listed above, as well as the other

expect. we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances
except to the extent required by applicable law.

operations in the united states in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the u.s. stores and clubs have been
developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the walmart international segment operates. in addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality
merchandise.

vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. we accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label store credit cards
issued by third-party providers and in chile, canada and mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries. other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.
across the walmart international segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. in

operations. the walmart international segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. historically, the highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending january31 and the lowest sales volume
and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending april30. the seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.
competition. the walmart international segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the
supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. we also operate local,
national and international restaurant chains in mexico, and consumer finance operations in canada, chile and mexico. our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the walmart international
segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which walmart international operates. in our international units, our ability to operate the food departments effectively has a major impact on the segments
competitive position in the markets where we operate.  distribution. we utilize a total of 134 distribution facilities located
in argentina, brazil, canada, chile, china, costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, japan, mexico, nicaragua and the united kingdom, including two export consolidation facilities in the united states. through these facilities, we process and
distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the walmart international segment. during fiscal 2011, approximately 77% of the walmart international segments purchases flowed through these distribution facilities.
suppliers ship the balance of the walmart international segments purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. of these 134 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 38. third
parties owned and operated the remaining 62 distribution facilities.  sams club segment
the sams club segment had net sales of $49.5 billion, $47.8 billion and $48.0 billion for the fiscal years ended january31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. during the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total company net sales.
general. as a membership club warehouse, we operate sams clubs in 48 states and puerto rico. facility sizes for sams clubs
generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 133,000 square feet. sams club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com.

saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. additionally, all club locations offer a gold key program that permits business members and plus members to shop before the regular operating hours monday through saturday,
starting at 7:00 a.m.  sams clubs are membership-only operations. a variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including
debit cards, certain types of credit cards, and private label and co-branded discover credit cards issued by a third-party provider. in addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our
members health benefit plans.  members include both business owners and individual consumers. individual consumers are referred to as
advantage members. the annual membership fee for an individual advantage member is $40 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. the annual membership fee for business
members is $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. in addition, business members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $35 (plus
taxes, if applicable) each. sams club plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both business and advantage club members. the annual fee for a primary plus member (business or advantage) is $100 (plus
taxes, if applicable). in addition, business plus primary members can add up to sixteen business associates to their business membership for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each.  seasonal aspects of operations. the sams club segments business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as
different climatic conditions. historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending january31, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur
during the fiscal quarter ending april30.
competition. sams club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount
retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. sams club competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club
sites. our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.  distribution. during fiscal 2011, approximately 63% of the sams club segments non-fuel purchases were shipped from the sams club segments dedicated distribution
facilities and some of the walmart u.s. segments distribution centers for certain items. suppliers shipped the balance of the sams club segments purchases directly to sams club locations. as of january31, 2011, our
sams club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental united states. of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 8. third parties owned and operated the
remaining 17 distribution facilities.  the principal focus of our sams clubs distribution operations is on cross-docking
merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility,
sometimes less than an hour.  sams club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers to transport
non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. we contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.  other segment information  certain financial information relating to our segments is
included in our annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended january31, 2011 (the annual report to shareholders) under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations and in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. note 16 includes information regarding our segment and total company net sales and the total assets and
long-lived assets of continuing operations we held in the united states and the other countries in which we operate. portions of the annual report to shareholders are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k.
employees  as of the end of fiscal 2011,
the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.1million employees (associates) worldwide, with approximately 1.4million associates in the united states and 0.7million associates internationally. similar to
other retailers, the company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt employees and experiences significant turnover in employees each year.  the company maintains separate profit sharing and 401(k) plans for associates in the united states and puerto rico. associates generally become participants following one year of employment. through
fiscal 2011, the profit sharing component of the plan was entirely funded by the company and the company made an additional contribution to the associates 401(k) component of the plan. in addition to the companys contributions,
associates could elect to contribute a percentage of their earnings to the 401(k) component of the plan.  beginning in fiscal 2012, the
company will offer a safe harbor 401(k) plan to all eligible united states associates. the company will match 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. the company will offer the same matching contribution to all
eligible puerto rico associates. the matching contributions will immediately vest at 100% for each associate. participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. participants age 50 or older may
defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.  in addition, in the united states, the company offers
a broad range of company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or sams club memberships, bonuses based on company performance, matching a portion of purchases in the associate stock purchase program, and life
insurance. the company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. the companys medical plan has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.  in our operations outside the united states, the company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

item1a.
risk factors  the risks described
below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. these risks are not the only risks that we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to
all companies operating in the united states and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.  general economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.  general economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. in the united states, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy
costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax
rates and other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart u.s. segment and sams club
segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. higher levels of unemployment,
inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse
developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the united
states. these conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our walmart international segment.
higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of
labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws
and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic
and international operations and our operating results. the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the
cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.  we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial
performance.  our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united
states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets, other store formats, and sams clubs and to
convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. local land use and other regulations restricting the
construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may
affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth
opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. if we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, neighborhood markets, other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into
supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. in addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not
receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected.  impediments to the expansion of our walmart
international operations could adversely affect our financial performance.  our business strategy for our walmart international segment
includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. in the countries
in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or sams clubs, not previously operated in those markets. as in
the united states, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our
ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. in addition, access to
local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets. moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new
retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. if we do not effectively
execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.  we may be unable to
continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly
acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. our failure to identify
appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial
performance.
failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could
adversely affect our financial performance.  our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on
our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and
distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which
we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. if we are unable to locate, to attract
or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted, our financial performance could be affected adversely.
we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
the retail business is highly competitive. each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in
other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. our walmart u.s. segment competes with retailers operating discount,
department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarts, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as
discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. internationally, we compete with retailers who operate
department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including
merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under
our edlp philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. see item 1. business above
for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments.  although the retail industry as a whole is highly
fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. such consolidation may result in competitors
with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. such business combinations could result in the provision of a
wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an
important factor in our financial performance. all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. our ability to find
qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states. political and economic
instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to
suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. in
addition, the united states foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain
materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.
our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our
suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. any lost
confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. as such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance.
our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial,
accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  we currently conduct operations in argentina, brazil, canada, chile, costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, japan, mexico, nicaragua, and the united kingdom, as well as through joint venture
agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china. during fiscal 2011, our walmart international operations generated 26.1% of our net sales. as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the united states,
we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively
affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. these factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, trade policies, both of the united states and
of the other countries in which we operate, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs
or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance.  moreover, the
economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. other factors which may
impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and
risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states. additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include, among others, the costs and
difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states. the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states
generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.
natural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance.
the occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather
conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we
operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores,
clubs and distribution centers, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace
from areas in which our stores, clubs and distributions centers are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local
and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of
products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the
areas in which these types of events occur, such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan, and could adversely affect our financial performance.  in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and
tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from
physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and
distribution centers, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages.
we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.  we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other
litigation. certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing
class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. in addition, we are a defendant in dukes v. wal-mart stores, inc., a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and
present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states. the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates. the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in
a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys fees. on june4, 2004, the u.s.
district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification, which we have appealed. on february6, 2007, a divided three-judge panel of the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit issued a decision affirming the district courts certification order. on february20, 2007, the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals. on
december11, 2007, the three-judge panel withdrew its opinion of february6, 2007, and issued a revised opinion. as a result, the companys petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot. the company filed a new petition for
rehearing en banc on january8, 2008. on february13, 2009, the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition. on april26, 2010, the ninth circuit issued a divided (6-5) opinion affirming certain portions of the district
courts ruling and reversing other portions. on august25, 2010, the company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court seeking review of the ninth circuits decision, which was granted by the united
states supreme court on december6, 2010. the company filed its brief for petitioner on january20, 2011; the brief for respondents was filed on february22, 2011; and oral argument was held on march29, 2011. we discuss these
cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption item 3. legal proceedings and in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, which are part of our annual report to shareholders, which are
incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k.  if we do
not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.  as do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers. in addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com and www.samsclub.com depend upon the secure
transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could
adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. in addition, a security
breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. disruptions in both our primary and
secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business.  although we have independent, redundant and physically separate
primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. our computer systems, including our back-up
systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. if our
computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. any material interruption
in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. in addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which
will include, for many of our computer systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management
process will mitigate this risk. if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.
we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our
relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.  it is difficult to predict consistently
and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. failure to timely identify or
effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.

on november8, 2005, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states attorneys office for the central district
of california, seeking documents and information relating to the companys receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous
waste. the company has been informed by the u.s. attorneys office for the central district of california that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the resource conservation and recovery act (the
rcra), the clean water act and the hazardous materials transportation statute. this u.s. attorneys office contends, among other things, that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the
companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. the government alleges that, to comply with rcra, the company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous
waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. the u.s. attorneys office in the northern district of california subsequently joined in this investigation. the company contends that the practice
of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. while management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this
matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
the u.s. environmental protection agency (the epa) approached a grocery industry group to resolve issues relating to refrigerant-handling
practices and to reduce the use of ozone-depleting refrigerants in refrigeration equipment. the company then approached the epa independently to address these issues, and proposed a plan for removing ozone-depleting refrigerants from certain types
of refrigeration equipment. while management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
in january 2007, wal-mart puerto rico, inc. became aware that the u.s. army corps of engineers (the usace) was concerned about alleged
violations of a permit issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its contiguous wetlands during the construction of the wal-mart store in caguas, puerto rico. on january19, 2007, wal-mart puerto rico responded to
these issues in writing. on january25, 2007, the usace issued a formal notice of non-compliance to wal-mart puerto rico regarding this matter. wal-mart puerto rico filed a formal response, implemented mitigation measures, and continues to
monitor and provide the required maintenance to the mitigation area. while management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition
or results of operations.  on march28, 2008, the company received a notice of violation from the missouri department of natural
resources (the department) alleging various violations of missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities of a third-party contractor with whom the company had contracted for recycling services. the
department alleges that the company provided certain items to the contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. the epa has inspected the contractors facilities, and both the epa and the u.s. attorneys office
for the western district of missouri are conducting investigations. the company has submitted a response to the notice of violation and is cooperating with these authorities. while management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter,
management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations.  on
august19, 2009, the office of the district attorney for riverside county, california, notified the company that it had instituted an investigation into whether violations of california laws regarding underground storage tanks occurred at two
sams club stations.the company and the district attorney have resolved the matter, and the settlement was approved by the court on november22, 2010. as part of the settlement, the company paid $750,000 in civil penalties and
$200,000 in costs.
in january, 2011, the environmental department of porto alegre municipality formally notified wms
supermercados do brasil ltda of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in brazil.wms supermercados do brasil ltda is cooperating with the agency as
well as the district attorneys office for the state of rio grande do sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.while management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the
outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations.

certain information required to be provided in this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information included under the captions market
price of common stock, listing and dividends paid per share in our annual report to shareholders. such information appears in the portion of the annual report to shareholders that is an exhibit to this annual report on
form 10-k.  our common stock is principally traded in the united states on the new york stock exchange. at march21, 2011, the latest
practicable date, there were 283,633 common stock shareholders of record.  on june3, 2010, the board of directors authorized a new $15.0
billion share repurchase program, which was announced on june4, 2010. the program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased
$15.0 billion of our shares under the program or we earlier terminate or replace the program. any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. we spent approximately $14.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.5 billion
for share repurchases during the fiscal years ended january31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. we consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases, including among other things, our current cash needs, our
capacity for leverage, our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock. at january31, 2011, we had $4.8 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases under the existing program.
share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program was as follows during our quarter ended january31, 2011:

controls and procedures
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to
management in a timely fashion. in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures
with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.  in the
ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal
control environment. changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began implementing a new financial system in stages and to date, have
completed implementations in the united states and puerto rico, the united kingdom, canada and japan. we plan to implement our new financial system in mexico during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. the new financial system is a significant
component of our internal control over financial reporting. we will continue to implement our new financial system in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting.
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period
covered by this report. this evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities
exchange act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide
reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the secs rules and forms.
