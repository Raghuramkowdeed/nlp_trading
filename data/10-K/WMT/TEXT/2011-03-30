MERCHANDISE.

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OUR

OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF SALES, NUMEROUS STORE BRANDS NOT OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE U.S. STORES AND CLUBS HAVE BEEN

DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY

MERCHANDISE.

8

OPERATIONS.

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WE ACCEPT A VARIETY OF PAYMENT METHODS INCLUDING CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND PRIVATE-LABEL STORE CREDIT CARDS

ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND IN CHILE, CANADA AND MEXICO, CREDIT CARDS ISSUED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

ACROSS THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, WE ARE LEVERAGING BEST PRACTICES, LESSONS FROM MULTIPLE STORE FORMATS AND GLOBAL SOURCING PRACTICES. IN

ADDITION, RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY GLOBAL SUPPLIERS CONTINUE TO HELP US LEVERAGE OUR VOLUMES ACROSS COUNTRIES.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. HISTORICALLY, THE HIGHEST SALES VOLUME AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME OCCUR IN OUR FISCAL QUARTER ENDING JANUARY 31 AND THE LOWEST SALES VOLUME

AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME OCCUR IN THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDING APRIL 30. THE SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION.

THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN THE

SUPERMARKET, DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ALSO OPERATE LOCAL,

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESTAURANT CHAINS IN MEXICO, AND CONSUMER FINANCE OPERATIONS IN CANADA, CHILE AND MEXICO. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL

SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATES. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL UNITS, OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS EFFECTIVELY HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE SEGMENTS

COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION.

WE UTILIZE A TOTAL OF 134 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES LOCATED

IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHILE, CHINA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, INCLUDING TWO EXPORT CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, WE PROCESS AND

DISTRIBUTE BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC PRODUCTS TO THE OPERATING UNITS OF THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT. DURING FISCAL 2011, APPROXIMATELY 77% OF THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

SUPPLIERS SHIP THE BALANCE OF THE WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENTS PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO OUR STORES IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OF THESE 134 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, WE OWNED AND OPERATED 34 AND LEASED AND OPERATED 38. THIRD

PARTIES OWNED AND OPERATED THE REMAINING 62 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

SAMS CLUB SEGMENT

THE SAMS CLUB SEGMENT HAD NET SALES OF $49.5 BILLION, $47.8 BILLION AND $48.0 BILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2011, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR, NO SINGLE CLUB LOCATION ACCOUNTED FOR AS MUCH AS 1% OF TOTAL COMPANY NET SALES.

GENERAL.

AS A MEMBERSHIP CLUB WAREHOUSE, WE OPERATE SAMS CLUBS IN 48 STATES AND PUERTO RICO. FACILITY SIZES FOR SAMS CLUBS

GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN 71,000 AND 190,000 SQUARE FEET, WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF APPROXIMATELY 133,000 SQUARE FEET. SAMS CLUB ALSO PROVIDES ITS MEMBERS WITH A BROAD ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES ONLINE AT

RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE SELL THROUGH OUR WALMART U.S. SEGMENT AND SAMS CLUB

SEGMENT, CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL TO ONE WITH A LOWER AVERAGE GROSS MARGIN, CAUSE A SLOWDOWN IN DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES OF GOODS AND RESULT IN SLOWER INVENTORY TURNOVER AND GREATER MARKDOWNS ON INVENTORY. HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

INFLATION, DEFLATION, DECREASES IN CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME, CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER LAWS, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, WEAKNESS IN THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ECONOMIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR MERCHANDISE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH AVERAGE INCOMES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN THE UNITED

STATES. THESE CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS, COST OF SALES, INVENTORY TURNOVER AND MARKDOWNS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT.

13

HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INFLATION, HIGHER COSTS OF

LABOR, INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES FLUCTUATIONS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE IMPOSITION OF MEASURES THAT CREATE BARRIERS TO OR INCREASE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CHANGES IN OTHER LAWS

AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DOMESTIC

AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. THE ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS ALSO AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE PURCHASE GOODS, A FACTOR THAT CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE

COST TO US OF THE GOODS WE SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR, IN MORE EXTREME CASES, COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN SUPPLIERS NOT PRODUCING GOODS IN THE VOLUME TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO US FOR SALE.

WE MAY FACE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR EXPANSION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS OF DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS AND OPENING OTHER STORE FORMATS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

OUR EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW MARKETS WITHIN THE UNITED

STATES AND UPON OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORES IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO OPEN ADDITIONAL SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS, OTHER STORE FORMATS, AND SAMS CLUBS AND TO

CONVERT EXISTING DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAND USE AND OTHER REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE

CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS OF THE TYPE IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR VARIOUS FORMATS, AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION OPPOSED TO THE LOCATION OF SPECIFIC STORES AT SPECIFIC SITES AND THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN LOCAL LAWS RESTRICTING OUR OPERATIONS, MAY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES AND CLUBS, TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS OR TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN CITIES AND STATES. INCREASED REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONVERT OUR DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OPEN NEW SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS, OTHER SMALL FORMATS OR SAMS CLUBS OR CONTINUE TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO

SUPERCENTERS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND ARE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS OR ARE OTHERWISE NOT

RECEPTIVE TO OUR PRESENCE IN A MARKET, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR WALMART

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

INCLUDES EXPANSION BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES THAT ADD NEW STORES AND MARKETS TO OUR EXISTING WALMART INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OPENING NEW UNITS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS. IN THE COUNTRIES

IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS, NEW UNITS MAY BE OPENED IN THE FORMATS ALREADY EXISTING IN THOSE COUNTRIES OR MAY BE OPENED IN NEWLY INTRODUCED FORMATS, SUCH AS SUPERCENTERS OR SAMS CLUBS, NOT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED IN THOSE MARKETS. AS IN

THE UNITED STATES, OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES OR TO EXPAND OR RELOCATE EXISTING STORES IN A MARKET SERVED BY OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND OUR

ABILITY TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAWS CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ATTRACTIVE PRE-EXISTING BUILDINGS IN WHICH TO LOCATE UNITS OR SITES ON WHICH TO BUILD NEW UNITS OR TO EXPAND EXISTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO

LOCAL SUPPLIERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADD NEW UNITS OR TO EXPAND PRODUCT SELECTIONS IN EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. MOREOVER, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN SOME MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND OR INTO WHICH WE INTRODUCE NEW

RETAIL CONCEPTS MAY RESULT IN THE CONSUMERS IN THOSE MARKETS NOT BEING AS RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS AS WE ANTICIPATE THOSE CONSUMERS WILL BE AND MAY MAKE AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO SUCH ISSUES MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY

EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION PLANS FOR OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION OF ANY SUCH CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED. ALTHOUGH WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY NEWLY

ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR ALLIANCES WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS OR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN A REASONABLE TIME. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY

APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR ACQUISITION OR ALLIANCE OR TO INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

14

FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES, CHANGES IN LAWS AND OTHER LABOR ISSUES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD DEPENDS ON

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO FILL POSITIONS THAT BECOME VACANT AT OUR EXISTING STORES, CLUBS AND

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHILE CONTROLLING OUR ASSOCIATE WAGE AND RELATED LABOR COSTS, IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PERSONS IN THE WORK FORCE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH

WE ARE LOCATED, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS WITHIN THOSE MARKETS, PREVAILING WAGE RATES, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS AND ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE, TO ATTRACT

OR TO RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, IF OUR COSTS OF LABOR OR RELATED COSTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF NEW OR REVISED LABOR LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM OTHER RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE RETAIL BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETES FOR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, STORE SITES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND IN

OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS WITH MANY OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL RETAILERS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR WALMART U.S. SEGMENT COMPETES WITH RETAILERS OPERATING DISCOUNT,

DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES AND HYPERMARTS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, AS WELL AS

DISCOUNT RETAILERS, RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROCERS AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, GASOLINE STATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. INTERNATIONALLY, WE COMPETE WITH RETAILERS WHO OPERATE

DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. SUCH RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS COMPETE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING

MERCHANDISE SELECTION AND AVAILABILITY, SERVICES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, LOCATION, STORE HOURS, IN-STORE AMENITIES AND PRICE. WHERE NECESSARY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH COMPETITORS WHO PRICE MERCHANDISE AT POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRICES WE SET UNDER

OUR EDLP PHILOSOPHY, WE WILL LOWER OUR PRICES ON GOODS FOR SALE. OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS ABOVE

FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR COMPETITIVE SITUATION IN OUR VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS HIGHLY

FRAGMENTED, CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SOME CONSOLIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION AND SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE RETAIL MARKETPLACE. SUCH CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN COMPETITORS

WITH GREATLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, IMPROVED ACCESS TO MERCHANDISE, GREATER MARKET PENETRATION THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITIONS. SUCH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COULD RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF A

WIDER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOURCED AND THE SAFETY OF THOSE PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS. GLOBAL SOURCING OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AND OTHERWISE BE CERTIFIED AS MEETING OUR REQUIRED SUPPLIER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. OUR ABILITY TO FIND

QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO MEET OUR STANDARDS, AND TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLIERS LOCATED AND GOODS SOURCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH FOREIGN SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO MEET OUR SUPPLIER STANDARDS, LABOR PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS, THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS TO

SUPPLIERS, MERCHANDISE QUALITY ISSUES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT AVAILABILITY AND COST, TRANSPORT SECURITY, INFLATION, AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO THE SUPPLIERS AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN

ADDITION, THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND OTHER IMPOSITIONS ON IMPORTED GOODS, TRADE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS OR OF GOODS CONTAINING CERTAIN

MATERIALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR ACCESS TO PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR CUSTOMERS COUNT ON US TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SAFE PRODUCTS. CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFETY OF FOOD AND NON-FOOD PRODUCTS THAT WE SOURCE FROM OUR

SUPPLIERS AND THEN SELL COULD CAUSE SHOPPERS TO AVOID PURCHASING CERTAIN PRODUCTS FROM US, OR TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THEIR FOOD AND NON-FOOD NEEDS, EVEN IF THE BASIS FOR THE CONCERN IS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. ANY LOST

CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF OUR CUSTOMERS WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO REESTABLISH. AS SUCH, ANY ISSUE REGARDING THE SAFETY OF ANY FOOD AND NON-FOOD ITEMS WE SELL, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

15

OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL,

ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHILE, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS WELL AS THROUGH JOINT VENTURE

AGREEMENTS IN CHINA AND INDIA AND OUR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES IN CHINA. DURING FISCAL 2011, OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERATED 26.1% OF OUR NET SALES. AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPANSION ACTIVITIES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

WE EXPECT THAT OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN FUTURE YEARS. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS IN THESE COUNTRIES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD BE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, TRADE POLICIES, BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND

OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, CURRENCY REGULATIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS

OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

MOREOVER, THE

ECONOMIES OF SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS HAVE IN THE PAST SUFFERED FROM HIGH RATES OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS, WHICH, IF THEY OCCURRED AGAIN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY

IMPACT OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE FOREIGN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING NUMEROUS FACILITIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LESS STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND

DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. THE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERALLY ALSO EXIST WHEN DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY BE EXAGGERATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

NATURAL DISASTERS AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CYCLONES, TYPHOONS, TROPICAL STORMS, FLOODS, EARTHQUAKES, TSUNAMIS, WEATHER

CONDITIONS SUCH AS MAJOR OR EXTENDED WINTER STORMS, DROUGHTS AND TORNADOS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE OR OTHERWISE, SEVERE CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CIVIL UNREST OR TERRORIST ATTACKS IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE

OPERATE OR IN WHICH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO, OR THE COMPLETE LOSS OF, ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES, THE CLOSURE OF ONE OR MORE STORES,

CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE WORK FORCE IN A MARKET, THE INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS AND OUR ASSOCIATES TO REACH OR HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO OUR STORES AND CLUBS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS, THE EVACUATION OF THE POPULACE

FROM AREAS IN WHICH OUR STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTIONS CENTERS ARE LOCATED, CHANGES IN THE PURCHASING PATTERNS OF CONSUMERS AND IN CONSUMERS DISPOSABLE INCOME, THE TEMPORARY OR LONG-TERM DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS FROM SOME LOCAL

AND OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS, THE DISRUPTION IN THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS FROM OVERSEAS, THE DISRUPTION OR DELAY IN THE DELIVERY OF GOODS TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR STORES WITHIN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE ARE OPERATING, THE REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF

PRODUCTS IN OUR STORES, THE DISRUPTION OF UTILITY SERVICES TO OUR STORES AND OUR FACILITIES, AND DISRUPTION IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR STORES. THESE EVENTS AND THEIR IMPACTS COULD OTHERWISE DISRUPT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE

AREAS IN WHICH THESE TYPES OF EVENTS OCCUR, SUCH AS THE RECENT EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

IN LIGHT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL PREMIUMS PAYABLE FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY CERTAIN NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, CYCLONES, TYPHOONS, TROPICAL STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND

TSUNAMIS IN THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET, AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR SUCH LOSSES, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BE PRIMARILY SELF-INSURED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOSSES. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN SPECIFIC COVERAGES FOR LOSSES FROM

PHYSICAL DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO GUARD AGAINST CATASTROPHIC LOSSES SUFFERED FROM SUCH CAUSES, WE STILL BEAR THE RISK OF LOSSES THAT WOULD BE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO, OR THE DESTRUCTION OF, ANY STORES, CLUBS AND

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, LOSS OR SPOILAGE OF INVENTORY, AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CAUSED BY ANY SUCH EVENTS BELOW CATASTROPHIC LEVELS OF COVERAGE, AS WELL AS IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE, IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF APPLICABLE COVERAGES.

16

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER

LITIGATION. CERTAIN OF THESE LAWSUITS, IF DECIDED ADVERSELY TO US OR SETTLED BY US, MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY A DEFENDANT IN NUMEROUS CASES CONTAINING

CLASS-ACTION ALLEGATIONS IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE BROUGHT CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN

DUKES V. WAL-MART STORES, INC.

, A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL PAST AND

PRESENT FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN ALL OF OUR RETAIL STORES AND WHOLESALE CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CLASS AS CERTIFIED IN

DUKES

CURRENTLY INCLUDES PRESENT AND FORMER FEMALE ASSOCIATES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGE THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN

A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN IN PROMOTIONS, PAY, TRAINING AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS AND SEEK, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, FRONT PAY, BACK PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS FEES. ON JUNE 4, 2004, THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT HEARING THIS CASE ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE HAVE APPEALED. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2007, A DIVIDED THREE-JUDGE PANEL OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT ISSUED A DECISION AFFIRMING THE DISTRICT COURTS CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION ASKING THAT THE DECISION BE RECONSIDERED BY A LARGER PANEL OF THE COURT OF APPEALS. ON

DECEMBER 11, 2007, THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL WITHDREW ITS OPINION OF FEBRUARY 6, 2007, AND ISSUED A REVISED OPINION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC WAS DENIED AS MOOT. THE COMPANY FILED A NEW PETITION FOR

REHEARING EN BANC ON JANUARY 8, 2008. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING THE PETITION. ON APRIL 26, 2010, THE NINTH CIRCUIT ISSUED A DIVIDED (6-5) OPINION AFFIRMING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE DISTRICT

COURTS RULING AND REVERSING OTHER PORTIONS. ON AUGUST 25, 2010, THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE NINTH CIRCUITS DECISION, WHICH WAS GRANTED BY THE UNITED

STATES SUPREME COURT ON DECEMBER 6, 2010. THE COMPANY FILED ITS BRIEF FOR PETITIONER ON JANUARY 20, 2011; THE BRIEF FOR RESPONDENTS WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 22, 2011; AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON MARCH 29, 2011. WE DISCUSS THESE

CASES AND OTHER LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE PARTY IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND ARE INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IF WE DO

NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER-RELATED INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

AS DO MOST RETAILERS, WE RECEIVE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR ONLINE OPERATIONS AT

WWW.WALMART.COM

AND

WWW.SAMSCLUB.COM

DEPEND UPON THE SECURE

TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS, INCLUDING INFORMATION PERMITTING CASHLESS PAYMENTS. A COMPROMISE OF OUR SECURITY SYSTEMS THAT RESULTS IN CUSTOMER PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING OBTAINED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, AND COULD RESULT IN LITIGATION AGAINST US OR THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, A SECURITY

BREACH COULD REQUIRE THAT WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RELATED TO OUR INFORMATION SECURITY SYSTEMS AND COULD RESULT IN A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUR ONLINE SALES OPERATIONS.

WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, SUMMARIZE RESULTS AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS. DISRUPTIONS IN BOTH OUR PRIMARY AND

SECONDARY (BACK-UP) SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INDEPENDENT, REDUNDANT AND PHYSICALLY SEPARATE

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS WE HAVE EACH YEAR, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE MAINTAIN UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS-CRITICAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS. OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR BACK-UP

SYSTEMS, ARE SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM POWER OUTAGES, COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, SECURITY BREACHES, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, TORNADOES AND HURRICANES, AND USAGE ERRORS BY OUR EMPLOYEES. IF OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS ARE DAMAGED OR CEASE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM, AND WE MAY SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS IN THE INTERIM. ANY MATERIAL INTERRUPTION

IN BOTH OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND BACK-UP SYSTEMS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE PURSUING COMPLEX INITIATIVES TO TRANSFORM OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS, WHICH

WILL INCLUDE, FOR MANY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, ESTABLISHING COMMON PROCESSES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS. THE RISK OF SYSTEM DISRUPTION IS INCREASED WHEN SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM CHANGES ARE UNDERTAKEN, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CHANGE MANAGEMENT

PROCESS WILL MITIGATE THIS RISK. IF WE FAIL TO INTEGRATE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE COST SAVINGS ANTICIPATED TO BE DERIVED FROM THESE INITIATIVES.

17

WE MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT CONSISTENTLY

AND SUCCESSFULLY THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR

EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES AND SPENDING PATTERNS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

YEAR-END JANUARY 31, 2011 IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS UNDER THE CAPTION FISCAL 2011 UNIT COUNT AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. PORTIONS OF SUCH ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

UNITED STATES.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2011, IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO, WE OWNED 3,293 OF

THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND OTHER SMALL FORMATS OPERATED AND 498 OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH OUR SAMS CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO OPERATED. LAND ON WHICH OUR STORES ARE LOCATED IS

EITHER OWNED OR LEASED BY THE COMPANY. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE LEASE THE REMAINING BUILDINGS IN WHICH OUR STORES AND CLUBS OPERATE FROM EITHER COMMERCIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS PURSUANT TO CAPITAL OR OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS OR FROM LOCAL

GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN CONNECTION WITH INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL STORE LEASES PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL RENTALS, SOME OF WHICH ESCALATE DURING THE ORIGINAL LEASE TERM. IN SOME CASES, THE LEASES PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL RENT BASED

ON SALES VOLUME. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS STORE AND CLUB LEASES HAVE RENEWAL OPTIONS, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE ESCALATION CLAUSES CAUSING AN INCREASE IN RENTS.

WE USE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO CONSTRUCT OUR BUILDINGS.

OUR 123 WALMART U.S. AND 25

SAMS CLUB DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE LOCATED STRATEGICALLY THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO. OF THESE 148 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, WE OWNED AND OPERATED 113 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, AND THIRD PARTIES OWNED AND OPERATED 35

OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES. IN ADDITION TO SERVICING THE WALMART U.S. SEGMENT, SOME OF OUR WALMART DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ALSO SERVICE OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT FOR CERTAIN ITEMS.

WE OWN OFFICE FACILITIES IN BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS THAT SERVE AS OUR HOME OFFICE AND LEASE OFFICE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR OUR WALMART.COM OPERATIONS AND FIELD MANAGEMENT.

WALMART INTERNATIONAL.

WE OPERATE OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT STORES AND RESTAURANTS IN A COMBINATION OF OWNED AND LEASED PROPERTIES

IN EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR WALMART INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2011, WE OWNED 43 PROPERTIES IN ARGENTINA, 175 PROPERTIES IN BRAZIL, 119 PROPERTIES IN CANADA, 142 PROPERTIES IN CHILE, 1 PROPERTY IN CHINA, 78 PROPERTIES

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

ITEM 103 OF SEC REGULATION S-K REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. THE FOLLOWING MATTERS ARE DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.

ON NOVEMBER 8, 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT

OF CALIFORNIA, SEEKING DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS RECEIPT, TRANSPORTATION, HANDLING, IDENTIFICATION, RECYCLING, TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN MERCHANDISE THAT CONSTITUTES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR HAZARDOUS

WASTE. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS A TARGET OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (THE

RCRA), THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION STATUTE. THIS U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE CONTENDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE USE OF COMPANY TRUCKS TO TRANSPORT CERTAIN RETURNED MERCHANDISE FROM THE

COMPANYS STORES TO ITS RETURN CENTERS IS PROHIBITED BY RCRA BECAUSE THOSE MATERIALS MAY BE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT, TO COMPLY WITH RCRA, THE COMPANY MUST SHIP FROM THE STORE CERTAIN MATERIALS AS HAZARDOUS

WASTE DIRECTLY TO A CERTIFIED DISPOSAL FACILITY USING A CERTIFIED HAZARDOUS WASTE CARRIER. THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED IN THIS INVESTIGATION. THE COMPANY CONTENDS THAT THE PRACTICE

OF TRANSPORTING RETURNED MERCHANDISE TO ITS RETURN CENTERS FOR SUBSEQUENT DISPOSITION, INCLUDING DISPOSAL BY CERTIFIED FACILITIES, IS COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS

MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE EPA) APPROACHED A GROCERY INDUSTRY GROUP TO RESOLVE ISSUES RELATING TO REFRIGERANT-HANDLING

PRACTICES AND TO REDUCE THE USE OF OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS IN REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY THEN APPROACHED THE EPA INDEPENDENTLY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, AND PROPOSED A PLAN FOR REMOVING OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS FROM CERTAIN TYPES

OF REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO RICO, INC. BECAME AWARE THAT THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (THE USACE) WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ALLEGED

VIOLATIONS OF A PERMIT ISSUED BY THAT AGENCY IN 2003, FOR THE FILL OF 0.23 ACRES OF A CREEK AND ITS CONTIGUOUS WETLANDS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WAL-MART STORE IN CAGUAS, PUERTO RICO. ON JANUARY 19, 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO RICO RESPONDED TO

THESE ISSUES IN WRITING. ON JANUARY 25, 2007, THE USACE ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF NON-COMPLIANCE TO WAL-MART PUERTO RICO REGARDING THIS MATTER. WAL-MART PUERTO RICO FILED A FORMAL RESPONSE, IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES, AND CONTINUES TO

MONITOR AND PROVIDE THE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE TO THE MITIGATION AREA. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WE MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION, WHICH IS REQUIRED TO BE TIMELY DISCLOSED, IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO

MANAGEMENT IN A TIMELY FASHION. IN DESIGNING AND EVALUATING SUCH CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ANY CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL

OBJECTIVES. OUR MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO USE JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. ALSO, WE MAY HAVE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES. SINCE WE DO NOT CONTROL OR MANAGE THOSE ENTITIES, OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WITH RESPECT TO THOSE ENTITIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LIMITED THAN THOSE WE MAINTAIN WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REVIEW OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND MAKE CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO IMPROVE SUCH CONTROLS AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY, WHILE ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. CHANGES MAY INCLUDE SUCH ACTIVITIES AS IMPLEMENTING NEW, MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS AND AUTOMATING MANUAL PROCESSES. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010, WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN STAGES AND TO DATE, HAVE

COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO, THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND JAPAN. WE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT OUR NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN MEXICO DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012. THE NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS A SIGNIFICANT

COMPONENT OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN STAGES, AND EACH IMPLEMENTATION MAY BECOME A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WAS PERFORMED AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD

COVERED BY THIS REPORT. THIS EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN THE REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE AND ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED BY THE SECS RULES AND FORMS.
