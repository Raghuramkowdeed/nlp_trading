THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COMPANY

ALTHOUGH

WAL-MART WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN OCTOBER 1969, THE BUSINESSES CONDUCTED BY OUR FOUNDERS BEGAN IN 1945 WHEN SAM M. WALTON OPENED A FRANCHISE BEN FRANKLIN VARIETY STORE IN NEWPORT, ARKANSAS. IN 1946, HIS BROTHER, JAMES L. WALTON, OPENED A

SIMILAR STORE IN VERSAILLES, MISSOURI. UNTIL 1962, OUR FOUNDERS BUSINESS WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO THE OPERATION OF VARIETY STORES. IN THAT YEAR, THE FIRST WAL-MART DISCOUNT CITY, WHICH WAS A DISCOUNT STORE, WAS OPENED. IN FISCAL 1984, WE OPENED

OUR FIRST THREE SAMS CLUBS, AND IN FISCAL 1988, WE OPENED OUR FIRST SUPERCENTER.

IN FISCAL 1992, WE BEGAN OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE WHEN WE ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE IN MEXICO, IN WHICH WE HAD A 50% INTEREST, WITH CIFRA S.A. DE C.V. (CIFRA). IN FISCAL 1998, WE ACQUIRED THE

CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CIFRA, AND IN FEBRUARY 2000, CIFRA OFFICIALLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO WAL-MART DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. SINCE FISCAL 1992, OUR INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND AT JANUARY 31, 2004, WE HAD INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA, MEXICO,

4

PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ALSO OPERATE THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA AND THROUGH A MINORITY INTEREST IN

JAPAN.

AT JANUARY 31, 2004, WE OPERATED IN THE UNITED STATES

1,478 DISCOUNT STORES, 1,471 SUPERCENTERS, 538 SAMS CLUBS AND 64 NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS. INTERNATIONALLY, AT JANUARY 31, 2004, THE COMPANY OPERATED UNITS IN ARGENTINA (11), BRAZIL (25), CANADA (235), GERMANY (92), SOUTH KOREA (15), MEXICO (623),

PUERTO RICO (53) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (267). WE ALSO OPERATE THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA (34). ADDITIONALLY, WE HOLD A 37.8% INTEREST IN SEIYU, A JAPANESE RETAIL CHAIN WHICH OPERATES APPROXIMATELY 400 STORES THROUGHOUT JAPAN.

OUR GROWTH, MEASURED BOTH BY OUR NET SALES AND NET INCOME, OCCURS IN LARGE

MEASURE AS A RESULT OF OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION PROGRAMS ALONG WITH COMPARATIVE STORE SALES INCREASES. WE CONSIDER COMPARATIVE STORE SALES TO BE SALES AT STORES THAT WERE OPEN AS OF FEBRUARY 1ST OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND WHICH

HAVE NOT BEEN EXPANDED OR RELOCATED DURING THAT PERIOD. COMPARATIVE STORE SALES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS SAME-STORE SALES BY OTHERS WITHIN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE SUMMARY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ADDITIONS OF UNITS AND SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR DOMESTIC DISCOUNT

STORES, SUPERCENTERS, SAMS CLUBS, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND INTERNATIONAL UNITS IN EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS FROM 2000 THROUGH 2004.

SCOPE OF MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME

MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A MAJORITY OF SALES, SEVERAL STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO

SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

OPERATIONS

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WHILE SALES ARE PRIMARILY ON A CASH-AND-CARRY BASIS, CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE

PROGRAMS EXIST IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE CUSTOMER.

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS

THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BUSINESS IS SEASONAL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE

PRICES ON QUALITY MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL UNITS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT

ON THE SEGMENTS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE OPERATE.

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. A COMBINATION OF COMPANY OWNED AND OPERATED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES MAKES UP THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION STRUCTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS.

EMPLOYEES (ASSOCIATES)

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2004, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION ASSOCIATES WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION

ASSOCIATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 360,000 ASSOCIATES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. MOST ASSOCIATES PARTICIPATE IN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION BASED UPON THE COMPANYS PRODUCTIVITY

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

ITEM 103 OF SEC REGULATION S-K REQUIRES

DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. THE FOLLOWING MATTERS ARE DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT REQUIREMENT.

DURING FISCAL 2001, THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT FILED SUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF HARTFORD ALLEGING VARIOUS

VIOLATIONS OF STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE PERMITS OR FAILED TO MAINTAIN REQUIRED RECORDS RELATING TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT 12 STORES. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE STATE FILED AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY ALSO HAD DISCHARGED WASTEWATER ASSOCIATED WITH VEHICLE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND PHOTO PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WITHOUT PROPER PERMITS. THE SUIT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE COMPANYS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL

PERMITS APPLICABLE TO THOSE ACTIVITIES.

THE UNITED STATES

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) HAS ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS HAVE VIOLATED THE EPAS STORMWATER REGULATIONS ON SPECIFIC SITES PRIMARILY IN COLORADO AND UTAH, BUT ALSO IN OTHER PARTS OF

THE COUNTRY. ON JULY 31, 2003, THE COMPANY SERVED THE EPA WITH A NOTICE OF DISPUTE AS REQUIRED BY A NATIONAL CONSENT DECREE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE EPA IN AUGUST 2001. SERVING THE NOTICE OF DISPUTE INITIATED AN INFORMAL DISPUTE

RESOLUTION PROCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT DECREE. THE COMPANY ALSO FILED A COPY OF THE NOTICE OF DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.

17

ON JULY 29, 2002, THE EPA ADVISED THE COMPANY THAT IT HAD INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INVOLVING THE

COMPANYS COMPLIANCE WITH SECTIONS 608 AND 609 OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER WITH REGARD TO THE SALES OF CLASS I AND CLASS II REFRIGERANT PRODUCTS. THE STATUTES PROVIDE THAT THE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE

RESTRICTED TO PERSONS AND/OR ENTITIES WHICH ARE PROPERLY LICENSED. THE EPA ASSERTS THAT, DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD, THE COMPANY MADE APPROXIMATELY 20 SUCH SALES TO NON-LICENSED PERSONS AND/OR ENTITIES. THE COMPANY HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO

SETTLE THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING OR VIOLATIONS OF THE STATUTES BY PAYING A $400,000 CIVIL PENALTY AND ENTERING INTO A CONSENT DECREE WITH THE EPA. WHEN APPROVED BY THE COURT, THE CONSENT DECREE WILL REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY

COMPLY FULLY WITH THE RELEVANT CLEAN AIR ACT SECTIONS AND REGULATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION BY THE OFFICE OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS. THE SUBPOENA SEEKS INFORMATION RELATED TO THE WASTE

DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS PHOTO PROCESSING LABS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

IN THE SPRING OF 2003, AN INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (FDEP) IN CONNECTION WITH THE

COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF ABOVE-GROUND STORAGE TANK SYSTEMS AS SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 62-761, FLORIDA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND

THE FDEP TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER HAVE COMMENCED.

III.

IMMIGRATION MATTER.

ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER 30, 2003, WAL-MART WAS FORMALLY ADVISED BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT IT WAS THE TARGET OF A FEDERAL GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION. THE NOTICE FROM THE

GOVERNMENT DID NOT IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST WAL-MART, BUT RATHER GENERALLY INDICATED THAT WAL-MART WAS THE TARGET OF A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION ASSESSING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW INCLUDING CONSPIRACY, AIDING AND

ABETTING TRANSPORTING ILLEGAL ALIENS AND ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL ALIENS TO RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE OR PRIVATE FINANCIAL GAIN, AND AIDING AND ABETTING THE UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT OF ILLEGAL ALIENS. WAL-MART

BELIEVES THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION RELATES TO ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS PROVIDING FLOOR CLEANING SERVICES TO WAL-MART AND THOSE CONTRACTORS ALLEGED EMPLOYMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE IN THE UNITED STATES

ILLEGALLY. THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION IS ON-GOING. ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 10, 2003, A CIVIL ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, CAPTIONED

ZAVALA ET AL. V. WAL-MART CORPORATION, ET AL

., CASE NO. 03-CV-5309. THIS COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT, AND VARIOUS STATUTORY CAUSES OF ACTION AND COMMON LAW

TORTS ARISING FROM THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING FLOOR CLEANING SERVICES IN ITS STORES. ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.
